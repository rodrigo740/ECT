Review: My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever. We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my LMG gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. "SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" he died after that. I cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.

Review: This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower. There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive. That is what this game is about.

I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive. That is what this game is about.

Review: This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols.

Review: Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

Review: Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game.

Review: This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign. Crowd around, children, it's story time. One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying. The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his "clan". I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived. This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport. My new friend was dead. 10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.

His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport. My new friend was dead. 10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.

Review: This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign. Crowd around, children, it's story time. One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying. The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his "clan". I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.

Review: If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get the money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob the bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.

Review: Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game. Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back. READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.

Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back. READ: I will not accept random friend requests!

Review: It's not a good 'game' for newbies. No, it's not... I use to sit at a place and watch the sunset. I have no idea how to actually shoot, drive and complete missions. It's like my personal sunset simulator. And it's damn beautiful. 10/10

Review: I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway. Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward. You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance. You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic. The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to. I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.

Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward. You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance. You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic. The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to. I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.

Review: Recommending this game is a no-brainer. If you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism Arma 3 is inevitable. The game won't let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. Also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield. The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. Groups range from run-and-gun type gameplay up to strictly milsim stuff, so there should be something for everybody. Bottom line, go get it. It's unique, in every aspect.

Review: Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but heres me trying it anyway. The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player. I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map Ive seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community. What you dont get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If youre in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If youre sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless. Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more? Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience. Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isnt the game youre looking for. Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign  those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but dont expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before  the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime. Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, Id certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it. I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that Im not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some.

Review: It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need. Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home. Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try. While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions. The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the "follower" category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings. It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan. While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to "find cover" (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body. Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons. Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface. Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on "Patrol" and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process. After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take. Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.

Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience. 8/10

Review: It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need. Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home. Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try. While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions. The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the "follower" category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings. It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan. While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to "find cover" (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body. Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons. Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface. Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on "Patrol" and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process. After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take. Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.

Review: I recommend this game but be warned there are a lot of bad things mainly due to some clunky controls, stiff animations and engine limitations(as well as performance issues online). There's nothing out there like it It's one of a kind really. It's a massively open world military simulator. The scale is huge and this is reflected perfectly in it's online modes and mods created by the modding community. The downside of this is they have one huge map, Altis, and that's all that's really there(No one plays Stratis which is the only other map and it's a lot smaller). So, you're pretty much stuck with the same map, same buildings, same roads, same cities, etc., etc. It would have been nice to have a bit of variety, at least from an official source as opposed to having to download maps from the modding community(Which are mostly maps imported from ARMA 2). This isn't to say that Altis is boring or a badly designed map -- it's quite the opposite! -- but having spent 100+ hours on the same map you do wish for a bit more especially after two years of development(Including Alpha and an expansion/season pass). The scale of the game was really brought to light in one of the first mods created for the game back when it was in Alpha; the co-op game mode Invade & Annex. This mode basically opened up the entire map for deployment from a central base complete with side missions that were entirely up to the players(100 or so) to take out. Missions required teamwork, coordination, squad based compositions, transport management, scouting, air support and heavy and light armour to complete. You would be deployed anywhere on the map with your squad to take on an objective and it was purely simulation based where you followed the chain of command to tackle objectives, requested support and had to wait for air/infantry/armoured support to arrive. There really was nothing like it in any other game and still isn't as far as i'm aware. Mods Speaking of mods this game has a lot of popular mods which, one could rightly assume, may even spawn standalone games of themselves given the huge amount of interest in them and the sheer amount of players who buy ARMA III specifically for some of the mods on offer. To name a few: King of the Hill - Mosh put style game mode where three teams fight for supremacy over an object(Most often entire cities or towns) by having as many players as possible from their team in the objective, killing enemies to lower their presence. Altis Life/ARMA 3 Life - A life RPG where you eat, team up with other players and take on roles in the virtual world of Altis ranging from picking apples, mining, fishing to becoming a rebel, mugger or even joining the police or military to enforce the law and fight off rebels. It's an RP experience so you're forced to act in character to make the mode more immersive(No random killing, you have to engage and have reason to shooting/killing people). Battle Royale - Just like the movie Battle Royale or, for the more modern crowd, it's similar to The Hunger Games. You parachute onto the island, land and try to find weapons and supplies to survive and kill other players. The objective is to be the last man surviving. A zone is marked and it gets smaller as the game progresses. If you're not in the marked area by the time you're given you die. The mods are really entertaining and while some are very simple and add onto the base experience they make the base game that much better although I would question why some mods simply were not developed by Bohemia to begin with and released with the game as standard. Controls and animations Controls are pretty janky. The animations are stiff and can get you killed. It takes a long time to learn all the controls and then even longer to relearn the controls for specific servers that have keys bound to different keys than what other servers have as standard. It's not a bad thing having all these controls as they do make a difference but what's bad is the animations which force you into a full animation loop which is slow, cumbersome and essentially makes you a free kill. For instance, if you want to holster your gun your character will stop. He will then initiate the animation. Put the gun away. Then he will stand up. Only then will you be able to move your character again and you can't interrupt these animations. You can't even run or walk while they're being performed which is simply frustrating and downright bad design. If you're in a firefight and mistakenly take out a pistol instead of your rifle prepare for five seconds -- if you're lucky not to die while this is happening -- of animation hell where you're left with pulling your hair out, screaming at the screen while you're in the middle of the battlefield, standing up and, rather hilariously, carelessly taking your primary from your shoulder with zero s given. Needless to say, the animations are pretty bad in most regards. Animations that can't be interrupted and require you to spend 5seconds performing the most simplest of animations is just bad by any stretch of the imagination. I don't think anyone can defend it and i've never heard anyone try to. Performance issues Performance is a huge setback for this game for the main reason that online performance, the core of the game that people are here for, depends entirely on the server you're on and the scripts it uses. If it's a poor server that doesn't get reset every so often you'll see your frames drop by 50-60%. You could be at 60FPS and then, due to the poor server, you're down to 15-20FPS no matter what computer you have. It's just one of those things you have to accept. You will also experience random freezes and random dips in performance even if you're on a good server. Some freezes can last from 2 seconds to 10 seconds or even longer. This has nothing to do with your computer. It doesn't happen so often that you'll find yourself dying over and over but it happens enough to be notable and strangely enough it doesn't seem to happen in firefights but mostly when you're sitting around doing nothing or just driving on an empty road. It's questionable to say the least. Having said that i'm running the game on close to ultra settings with an FPS of around 30-40 for the most part on a Windows 7 64bit PC, no SSD, 4GB DDR3 RAM, an i5-750 CPU at stock speed(2.67Ghz) and an AMD r9 290 4GB graphics card. There's still slowdowns and performance still largely depends on the server i'm on and what mod it is. In single player my frames will easily double and be consistent with no performance drops. Single player I probably should have started off with single player but I felt a pros over cons is the best way for the flow of this review. The single player isn't great if i'm to be honest. Enemy AI will spot you from a few miles(or km's) away before you even have a chance to see them. You'll be told by the AI leader to target and kill an enemy at X distance or to proceed to location Y only to die because you can't see the three aimbot AI perched three kilometers away on a hill with assault rifles seemingly sniping at you. You'll die a lot and it will only feel like a cheap death. Deaths are just cheap in the SP campaign which is reflected in one of the earlier missions where you enter a minefield and get blown up instantly which is the game's way of saying: "Trial and error, you'll know next time." It's cheap and it's bad design for a game simulation or not. The story itself isn't great either. Conclusion It's worth the money. There's no game out there like it and there's no game that offers as much as ARMA III does in terms of sheer scale and simulation. There's a few negatives to go against the game but ultimately this is definitely something you should have in your game library if you even remotely enjoy shooters or military shooters of any kind.

Review: This game features a lot more than it may seem. It's got lots of gamemodes and different experiences even if you do play the same gamemode over and over. Everytime you play will be a different experience, may it be your role, the difficulty, or the ai. It's all different every time. You can find a lot of funny moments where the game will glitch out on you a bit but it's not really game-breaking, it's just a moment you can laugh about. Plus the amount of customization in the game is unbelievable, There's so much different changes you can do to the game, from changing your character's voice or face, up to making a whole addon and even more. Im not gonna say the game's completely perfect though. The main problem may be the community, but from time to time you'll not meet with that problem; some people will be nice to you and help you if you're a newbie to the game, and some will just go hard on you and troll you but those guys are rare, as people dont appreciate them on the servers. The gameplay; Now that is one hard question to answer. The gameplay mostly matters about you, and the gamemode, how you want to play, will still be valid, but you are restricted to thinking a lot about your actions or you'll get shot by some guy from 800 meters while he's only using a simple rifle with no scope. As you would guess, another problem is the AI, sometimes it may act rediculous and sometimes it's just the best AI you can find in a game. now, im not gonna go over the gamemodes here as it's better to find out yourselves, but i'll just say that King Of The Hill, Wasteland(mostly fun with friends), and Zeus(you'll be most likely to spend days on this one) are the ones i recommend. The community: The community has an endless array of addons you could use to change your game and/or experience. I'm not gonna say much about it except this but there's alot you can say about the community. The Engine: this game requires a beefy pc(currently at its state) but the engine is brilliant, It can run alot of data without having to give you frame drops or hard CPU usage. The engine is mostly dependant rather more on the RAM than the CPU, i recommend atleast 6-12 RAM for this game if you're gonna play it alot. Overall: The game's worth a shot for people who like to plan their moves and think about what they do it before they do it, altough you will find mostly funny moments and non-serious moments in multiplayer but less than serious moments that are mostly enjoyable. Certain people refer to this as a "Walking Simulator" but the point is that ArmA III is mainly focused on infantry and combined arms, you WILL find yourself walking and running alot to objectives, but that's how it is in real life too. The game is focused on reality and will be a hard challenge for people who arent used to this type of gaming. You can find alot to do in this like commanding AI and/or players, which is always hard at the start, and participating in large assaults on towns such as Kavala. In my opinion, ArmA III is worth a shot. -Lankercool, Commander and Soldier, also regular Zeus player in the ArmA III Community.

Review: Very Addictive I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an in-depth military sandbox shooter. This game does a great job overall of satisfying the thirst for using tactics in combat. Before I get any farther into this review, I would like to point out that this game is nothing like COD or Battlefield. That doesn't necessarily mean it can't be fast paced, but the learning curve for this game can be kind of deep for some. I'm going to focus primarily on general gameplay, rather than go in-depth with mods. Overall Gameplay 9/10 This game is often called a walking simulator, however this game is so much more than that. Once you play long enough, you just look at walking as another method of travel. You start weighing your options as you come into contact with objectives/other players. Do you want to risk driving to a location, only to get blown up by AT (anti-tank) or would you rather take the longer, but mostly safer method of walking. Once you get yourself in this mindset you really stop caring about how much you have to walk. That being said you can see how decisions can ultimately lead to success or failure. This is perhaps one of favorite things about this game. Want to stealthily insert from the sea SEAL style? Would you rather set up on a hill 1.5km away and pick off the enemy? Or would you rather roll with a battalion of tanks and annihilate everything in your path. The decision is ultimately yours. You may find that a lot of this isn't in the vanilla game, but thankfully the modding community has done an amazing job shaping this game into so much more. Combat 8/10 : Combat is great, but it has its problems (some very frustrating problems at that). PvP combat is always amazing and most of the time it comes down to who has the better tactics. However... The AI is ridiculous. It has gotten better overtime, but the AI is completely unpredictable. Sometimes you can drive up to them and kill all of them without them even getting a shot off, or you can be 1km off sitting on a hill with your sniper and start picking them off, only to be obliterated by them with ridiculous aim. Don't let that ruin your experience though. Some of my favorite moments in this game have to do with the AI doing something completely hilarious (EX: taking you on a tour of a town in a small hatchback for no apparent reason). Mechanics 9/10: falls 2 feet to the ground, dies... To be fair combat mechanics in Arma 3 are much better IMO than that of previous Arma titles. Bullet penetration is verrryyyy well done. It can easily give you an advantage especially if you have a weapon like the .50 cal Lynx that can kill enemies in armored vehicles. Bullet spread/drop seems realistic enough. If your one of those people like me who wanted sniper mechanics to be real you'll be mostly dissappointed, but ranging and bullet drop can be compensate a little. There are lots of options for movement and stances (they can actually benefit you greatly in combat). I HIGHLY recommend staying away from rocks. I have no idea why, but rocks can instakill/trap you if your not careful. Not all rocks are like this, mostly just large ones... stay away... Visuals 9/10: When first playing this game on ultra it can be breath taking. For the full experience I would highly suggest wearing some nice headphones and turn up the volume. The immersion is very enjoyable. If you can't run the game on ultra dont feel left out. It still looks great, and can often times give you an unfair advantage over players online (being able to see through foilage/fog). There's probably a lot I could add to this review, but a lot of the enjoyment comes from mods. There are too many good ones to list. I may sound a little biased because I love this game so much, but if the above that I described sounds remotely like something your interested in then I highly recommend it.

Review: When I first played ArmAII, I barely enjoyed the game, nor did I stay for too long simply because I didn't like it. Coming to ArmAIII, I felt a whole different experience, a new environment like never before. Something attracted me to this game when I first played it during a free weekend; a feeling of excitement, fear, and all sorts of emotions of that nature. I felt like a real soldier in an actual militaristic environment. Months, later when I actually bought it, I got hooked again with the same elements as before. Here are some of the pros and cons after a good 15 hours on the game: Pros: -Somewhat real life experience, (i.e. running, (actual stamina system based on how much weight you carry), driving, aiming and firing, etc.) -Weaponry, (Different types of ammo, explosives range from mines to grenades, Launchers, etc). -Amazing Teamwork -Vehicles -Both a Third Person Shooter AND a First Person Shooter Cons: -Unstable FPS issues, (literally stay away from this game if you don't have a strong CPU, since this game mainly focuses on more CPU power than GPU) that vary depending on either campaign or multiplayer. I seem to run better on multiplayer for some odd reason, but sometimes it's the same as single player on certain occasions such as driving. You literally have to deal with it. The lowest FPS I get on Ultra Settings with a Nvidia GTX 770 and i7 4770k is around 30 tops, maybe a good 25 sometimes, (like I said when doing various tasks). -Unreal Physics at certain times. So basically, let's say you climb a 5 foot ladder inside a building and fall or you leap from a 1.5 foot distance from a flight of stair in general. Picture the size of 5 feet. That's 60 inches. Jumping from this distance= death. Yup. And even a slight bump from the rear of a car can kill a player, (around a 10-15 mph car can kill a player in this). These are some small things to overlook by BI, but still, I face palm sometimes at the unreality of the physics. -Difficult controls. It took me some time to learn all of the controls, and almost 5 minutes to figure out how to aim down the sights. Simple things like these can easily be overlooked, but are for sure some of the things to know when coming into ArmA. It ain't easy to get into like Call of Duty or Battlefield. Neutral Comments: -One last thing to say is that this game can be a running simulator at times. Although you have to travel far distances sometimes on foot, (and waste a good amount of time), the game provides a lush, realistic environment that contributes the beauty of nature. It compensates for all the running that has to be done, but allows you to explore the wilderness of a massive island. All in all, this is my review for the game. TL;DR: Good military sim, one of the best out there. Gives you good feels, but lacks on certain parts. A "deal with the graphical issues" game.

Review: Recommending this game is a no-brainer. If you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism Arma 3 is inevitable. The game won't let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. Also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield. The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. Bottom line, go get it. It's unique, in every aspect.

Review: The most accessible game in the series, this is Bohemia Interactive's magnus opus and my favourite instalment since the days of Operation Flashpoint (now ARMA: CWC) and it's incredible addons, the technological leap is huge and the possibilities for the end user are limitless, catering to any taste with a very active modding community to boot, potentially taking it far beyond a mil-sim. I have owned this game since the alpha phase and has been worth every penny, it's never been perfect but the development team are constantly striving to make it so. One of the greatest titles I've had the pleasure of owning on the PC for many years.

Review: This game is amazing. Not only can you get just about any mod you want for it- you can get Breaking Point- DayZ in Arma. You can play Altis Life- make money and act a civilian or go do illegal things. You can play King Of The Hill- Get some PVP in. This is the best Multiplayer simulator and is definitely an amazing purchase that I've made and I'll never regret.

Review: A3 is a great tactical army sim, has so much to do it is very hard to get bored. great community (in places) and great mods available via ArmAholic. Granted it has its bugs (like the rest) but they are slowly but surely fixing it. 9/10. Would recommend to anyone

Review: So. This is one of my Favourite games of all times, since ArmA 1 and CnC Commanders was released. People are complaining about the missing campaigns, being impatient and just douching all over the place because its not a CoD. This game is just like the best MIlSimulator ive ever played, right after ArmA 2 OA. Bohemnia interactive did a very fine job. It has bullet penetration. The soldiers are highly customizable and damn... it is even supporting Mods and encouraging people to create stuff. If you want a real multi-player and FPS capable game, please buy this. Its just amazing. Graphics and Gameplay is O-U-T-S-T-A-N-D-I-N-G. ArmA 2 Needed an additional mod, called ACE, this game here, does not even need any more realism mods, because it IS Realism itself! Worth the money. Fun to play. 9.5/10 -Acekiller.

Review: I had to add some more things to this review, as I started to appreciate it even more after some time spent in the game, both playing and creating content. I tend to get rambly, so this is going to be a TL;DR version for you if you don't like reading textwalls: It's just awesome. Very immersive and deep, rewarding, satisfying, milsim experience. 1st episode of campaign took me 4 hours of gameplay on its own. Both multiplayer and singleplayer are great, along with the community-made content available via workshop. Looks beautiful on graphics cranked up to ultra ;) I was even able to set my sampling to 150% without any performance loss after the recent updates and I have to say - the graphics are phenomenal. Second and third episodes of campaign were good as well, added up towards a complete story which gave me some backup on game's plot and situation on Altis in 2035. Zeus is very exciting, but it takes some practice and experience to provide players with fun time. Fatigue & weapon inertia updates added a lot of depth to shooting. Now there is rotorLib to come along with shooting from vehicles, and that's going to change helo flying entirely. See what I'm doing here? I'm proving you the devs constantly make this game better, it evolves within your eyes, and every day you play it you find something new about it, for example - recently I found out the angular size of the moon is actually correct, the night sky mapping is accurate and you can navigate using the northern star, and measure the distance using your compass and mils on it, like in real life. Enough of this rambling. I have to say it's breathtakingly good. The possibilities it offers, the dev team which continues to add deepness to it... Some people don't like the recent updates, but for me these updates just build up more realism and add to overall greatness. And the team takes feedback into account, having really good policies both on DLCs and on new content put into the game. Things you can do modding it are pretty crazy. I'll give you an example for better understanding: - The game itself, in vanilla version, features pretty complex ballistic mechanics. It also features exhaust pipe particle effect of hot air. What has one to do with another you might ask? Well, a mod author took the first one, added much more deepness to create accurate ballistic simulation, and even used the particle effect I've mentioned earlier to simulate bullet trace effect in high-power optics... Yup, you can do anything you want with this game.

Review: The best MILSIM shooter out there. It can be as realistic and immersive as you want with the addition of the community mods that are available. The single-player campaigns are great and the recent addition of a bootcamp will give new players a way to get familiar with the game and it's controls.

Review: A really nice game. If you want to play a realistic tactic shooter, Arma 3 is the way to go. The best thing about Arma 3 is creating your mission and almost create any sore of gamemode to be played by yourself or with someone else of maybe even a server. One of the best gamemodes everyone shuold try if you get the game is Atlis Life which is a roleplay gamemode. I played over 1000 hours plus of it and that show how much i love this game, most of the time i would be playing with my mates or people i meet in game. I would recommend to play this game with at least one friend!

Review: My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever. We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my LMG gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. "SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" he died after that. I cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.

Review: This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower. There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive. That is what this game is about.

There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower. There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive. That is what this game is about.

Review: Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

Review: This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign. Crowd around, children, it's story time. One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying. The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his "clan". I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived. This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport. My new friend was dead. 10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.

Review: If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get the money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob the bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.

If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob the bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.

Review: Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game. Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back. READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.

Review: I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway. Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward. You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance. You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic. The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to. I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.

You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward. You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance. You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic. The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to. I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.

Review: My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever. We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my LMG gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. "SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" he died after that. I cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.

Review: This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower. There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive. That is what this game is about.

There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive. That is what this game is about.

Review: This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.

Review: Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

Review: Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis.

Review: This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign. Crowd around, children, it's story time. One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying. The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his "clan". I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived. This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport. My new friend was dead. 10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.

Review: If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get the money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob the bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.

Review: Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game. Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back. READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.

You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game. Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back. READ: I will not accept random friend requests!

Review: It's not a good 'game' for newbies. No, it's not... I use to sit at a place and watch the sunset. I have no idea how to actually shoot, drive and complete missions. It's like my personal sunset simulator. And it's damn beautiful. 10/10

Review: I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway. Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward. You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance. You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic. The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to. I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.

Review: My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever. We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my LMG gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. "SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" he died after that. I cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.

I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my LMG gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. "SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" he died after that. I cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.

Review: This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower. There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive. That is what this game is about.

Review: Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

Review: Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together.

Review: This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign. Crowd around, children, it's story time. One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying. The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his "clan". I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived. This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport. My new friend was dead. 10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.

Review: If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get the money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob the bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.

Review: Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game. Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back. READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.

I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back. READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.

Review: Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game. Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly.

Review: It's not a good 'game' for newbies. No, it's not... I use to sit at a place and watch the sunset. I have no idea how to actually shoot, drive and complete missions. It's like my personal sunset simulator. And it's damn beautiful. 10/10

Review: I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway. Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward. You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance. You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic. The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to. I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.

Review: Arma 3 makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons. This time around its trump card is Steam workshop integration though, making downloading mods effortless. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it are those mods that will give Arma 3 its long lifespan. Unfortunately Arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. Space time and perseverance are your best friends here, until Bohemia's support starts paying off.

Review: This is the definitive shooter. Forget Call of Duty, forget Battlefield, this is leagues beyond those titles. From fighting as a lone wolf to supporting a team of seventy-two other players on land, above or below seas, and in the sky, everything feels just as it should, just as it would be if it were real. For those that love beutiful visuals, sharp skill curves, and of course, Bohemia's trademark realism, this title cannot be missed.

Review: Vastly improved in movement, combat, and functionality, ArmA 3 is a big improvement graphically and gameplay wise. The content inside although, is nowhere to be seen. It's still a pretty barren game, with only 1 episode of the campaign. But it is still very fun, and I do reccomend it to fans of the ArmA series and even newcomers. Just wait for the modding community to fix most of the problems.

Review: Arma 3 enhances on the Arma 2 experience by running better and expanding on features to make it a lot more of a smooth experience. With Arma 2 movement was clunky and sometimes that could have gotten you killed in a firefight because you couldn't get in cover because of the really bad control scheme, however with Arma 3 that is fixed with the stances system. The vehicles of Arma 3 are a lot better than Arma 2, it works. I can't wait until mods like ACE are released on Arma 3 expanding on the experience even more. It's well worth the price. Although the content is slightly lacking, the game expands on Arma 2 loads and I'm sure an expansion pack like Operation Arrowhead will appear for Arma 3 aswell. Buy it, well worth it.

Review: Arma 3 is definately improved on Arma 2, and what it lacked at launch is now in the game; Full Campaign. When we start to get more maps, I think Arma 3 will be a very good purchase. Right now, it is quite fun if you are in for a full military simulation, however if you are looking for the aftermarket mods like DayZ ( Or any big mods, I don't think DayZ will be in Arma 3 for obvious reasons) Then you should wait a bit. Arma 3 was definately worth the full price, and It was one of the only games in recent times to really "Wow" me with such massive scale. And for those new to the series, Arma 3 shouldn't be too intimidating as it has many tutorials, but in game and outside it. Once again, Arma has a very good level editor, which you can access from the game and begin making scenarios straight away, or use external scripts for more advanced ones, if you know how to.

Review: This is definitely one of the hardest games i have played, i mean, i tried the first mission +30 times on easy and never survived the first encounter with the enemy. I had to find a cheat just to get past the the first battle, but the next was just as hard. I don't think Dark Souls is this hard, and it gets worse as you progress. One annoying thing is when your character gets fatigued from running he starts to pant harder than a vintage German porn flick, i guess NATO must have lowered the standards in 2035. He'll start panting after ~30 meter and it gets worse if you continue to run, even walking makes him sound like he a heavy smoker with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. But don't let the single player main campaign scare you from buying the game, you can have much more fun with the editor. It takes some time to figure it out, but you can make really good missions with it. The graphics is good, but you need a very powerful PC to play it with high settings. The FPS is showing when you do the changes so you don't have to exit the menu to test it. A joystick is recommended for flying the planes and helicopters. The game have a good variety of weapons, equipment and vehicles. The ballistics add a touch of realism.

Review: Hello everyone thematrixman here giving my review on this fantastic game. So if you have played Arma 2 this is a huge jump in the right direction. Personally I didnt like Arma 2 due to its crappy controls and bugs. However, I did like the big open atmosphere which Arma 3 keeps and even out does it if i say do so myself. I gonna be straight out with you guys I have not beat the campaign yet because of difficulty and just lack of interest. The multiplayer is really the way to go as well as player made levels. I recomend playing capture the island for it puts this game to its max and create the intensity of a real war. Overall if you are ever wanting to play cti msg me and we can frag some noobs. The commaning is really crisp and you often have to think on the fly which is great for people who like strategy like me. The A.I arent that bad as they can fly helicopters better than me, but driving is another story (psst, if you put them in relax mode they will only drive on roads). So I conclude that this game will provide you with endless entertainment and i hope to see some of you online. This is matrix signing out!

Review: I was half way through a very long operation which a friend created and my TV Remote slipped and fell on my keyboard, I threw a grenade, reloaded, went to prone and opened my backpack in all one hit. Then I ran up a slight incline and was fatigued, we were then contacted from the south and a turned to see a squad. My CoD experince thought "Huh, four guys easy!". I soon came to realise that even anybody can kill you in this game with ease, a few shots down range at me and I was to shakey to even locate my target in my sights. I got shot in the head and ragdolled down a hill. The last save point was 20 minutes before this. I decided to try a campaign mission where you are alone with a guy in a forest. I was following him close behind and he stepped on a mine and killed us both. Turns out you're not meant to be close to this guy. I played again and kept very far away from him. I stepped on a mine this time and died. A brutal shake-em-up with a massive sandbox to blow things up in. You're not even safe in the scripted events.

Review: I've been part of the ARMA franchise since Operation Flashpoint. This is by far the best MilSim to ever be released. If you're into slow, simulated and realistic gameplay... This game is the one for you.

Review: Excellent, just absolutely excellent game. The possibilites and endless scenarios that you can create yourself just makes this games one of the best games of this genre, and possibly one of the better and more unique games for PC. Unrivalled in creativity and possibilities, ArmA 3 is a masterpiece added to the genre. Bohemia delivers, yet again.

Review: I tried to go down a slide. Biggest mistake I ever made. Thankfully there was a kind doctor nearby who saved my life from the evil creature that was the slide. Notify the government, slides are lethal. And to think we let children play on them. Science has gone too far I say! 10/10 for kind doctors who understand the dangers of slides.

Review: Seriously, it's not your average Battlefield or Call of Duty shooter... FAR FROM! this is real war simulation what all possible factors included! If you want to wage war like a real soldier in life-like situations, this is a game for you. This game however has many different controls and doesn't exactly have a user-friendly control because you need to press multiple buttons mostly to even execute one action, apart from basic movement and such, but if you've ever played any other Bohemia Interactive game, you should already know that. other than these hard-to-master controls, this game is truely amazing, breathtaking, and even let's you use an editor for putting together your own missions. I personally like it for combat flight simulation.

Review: ARMA 3 has been a constantly evolving game. Definitely worth checking out now that it's a more refined experience, has tons of incredible user created scenarios, a lot of variety online, and finally, the first part of the campaign is available. This has been the most fun I've had in a shooter all year, and I expect to continue enjoying it for years to come.

Review: This game is just what you would expect from the Bohemia Interactive devs, a great game that is fun with a group of friends. You have many recuring mods in the ARMA series such as island life, wasteland, domination, and even an ARMA 3 port of DayZ, there is even a gamemode only in ARMA 3 called King of the hill. With the multiplayer basis out of the way what about singleplayer? ARMA 3 provides a story driven campaign, and a couple of showcases i.e. Infantry Combat, Aquatic Warfare, etc. ARMA 3 is also returning with a more user friendly mission editor/creator, here you can make your own missions that you or some friends can test out, or upload it to the Steam Workshop. Along with uploading you can also download others missions, some serious, some not. But other than that you should have a great time with this game. Now for the cons (every game has some) just as expected this game is extremely CPU intensive, and GPU intensive, so if you are getting this game make sure you have a good computer. P.S. FPS will be drastically higher in singleplayer compared to multiplayer i.e. SP 45-60 MP 15-30 depending on the server (some are crappy) BEWARE!

Review: Arma 3 is a military sandbox from Bohemia Interactives. I did not have the pleasure of joining the community until Arma 3 was released but glad to have bought the game after highly rated reviews from the online community. I have played the introductory showcases which shows you infantry, armor, and air elements of the games to get started. The campaigns were also an interesting experience as well but lacked that live squad tactics that I desired. Consequently, I transitioned towards multiplayer to see what it had to offer. At the current time, Invade&Annex (capture the town objective), Breaking Point (Zombie RPG), Atlis Life (RPG), and Wasteland (Dynamic Missions and RPG) remains the most popular maps on the servers. Invade&Annex is probably the closest to a military element out of the 4 and the other four are probably experiences that can be better found in other titles. A game model built in realism, infantry tactics, and armor assets should be better utilize than just simply playing RPGs. In search of a more military experience, I discovered Endless Survival, Whole Lotta Atlis, and private gamemaster games more enriching. I found some things that you can't simply experience on those common maps & servers mentioned in the previous paragraph. When can you say that you were able to fly the A10-C Thunderbolt II, parachute into the AO next to your squad, or evacuating out of a hot LZ after protecting the president at the hospital? These were just some of the satisfying environments in which I have played in. In hopes of playing with more like minded fellas and pushing for milsim, let's play! I'm always glad to meet new friends. Strength and Honor, timh1203

Review: Whilst still not as refined as it's predecessor Arma 3 offers a host of improvements in it's engine and graphics. The community is growing and you can expect to find a vast array of experiences from the many game-modes on offer: CTI (Capture the Island) KOTH (King of the Hill) Life Roleplaying Battle Royale Team Deathmatch Zeus COOP Patrol Ops COOP Invade and Annex COOP To really appreciate this game find a good group of people to play with and it'll probably become the best gaming investment you ever made!

Review: This game is the best war simulator you can get on steam, it cost alot, but it's worth it. Spend 100 hours in this game, enjoyed every single minute. Recommended mods for this amazing game: Breaking point(Kinda fun) Battle Royale(Most intensive  ever) Epoch(Same as Breaking point, but with building, so it's abit better.) Arma3Life(Best roleplay, alot of new cars, guns. Well it was fun atleast, when it was closed beta now it's kinda shity.)

Review: Fantastic mil-sim game. Sure you may complain about the bugs there are and how the game may look bad, but I've had some of the best times in my life on this game with so many people. So many friendships made, broken, different units, merges, clan battles(trash talking not a pvp match), crazy things and lots more stupid stuff like jumping over helicopters with a HUMMV.

Review: tl;dr Game is slower paced but very good. This game is the pinnacle of the military FPS subgenre. It literally does not get any better than this when it comes to realistic shooters. Do not go into the game expecting fast paced shooting like in most modern shooters. Expect to use tactics and work with your team to overcome enormous obstacles. This is not for people who need to shoot something every 5 seconds. Most of the meat of the gameplay is in coordinating with your squadmates, completing objectives, and getting shots in from sometimes thousands of yards away. Every kill is a small victory in this game; getting 8 kills during a multiplayer coop mission is something to be proud of, depending on the mission. The satifsfaction from eliminating enemies in this game is not one of "I got a lot of kills" but "I helped my squad complete an objective." Personally I didn't like ARMA 2 because of how clunky it felt with both it's inventory management and control, but that's completely remedied in ARMA 3. Movement feels responsive and the inventory is streamlined and easy to understand. The developers are adding new features to this game for free constantly and workshop support + numerous mods ranging from full conversions to minor gameplay improvements ensure that there is no end to the amount of content you can download for this game. On top of that, at least from the people I've played with the community is stellar, the fact that this is a "Hardcore" shooter means that most of the kiddies who come from "That game franchise" get bored and leave immediately leaving only the dedicated whom are willing to learn and utilize the unique gameplay mechanics. This has to be the first game where the times I've actually run into 12 year olds, they were just as helpful, attentive, and cooperative as the average good player. Expect to walk for long periods of time before engaging in any actual firefight and expect to train yourself in single player before joining an online game. I had to play http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=192094335&searchtext=Helicopter+Training for a good four hours before I was comfortable with flying a heli let alone going into enemy lines with one; Even after I'm still a bit rusty. But I'll get better. Same with learning how to operate a sniper rifle, which actually involves adjusting distance for your bullets to go where you want them to. A mission I play often to train in sniping is http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=227323006&searchtext=Blue+viper My gripes with the game extend to at times awful friendly/enemy AI, really. Another thing is that this game could have benefitted from a demo or benchmark as the optimization is different than ARMA 2's and many I know are unsure if this game will run right on their lower end PCs. The game could also do with an official mod manager that streamlines server mod downloads; it's easy to download missions but not mods. You'll be able to play on only very few servers since most run some mod like ACRE or a mod that one might have to go on a wild google chase to find. Edit: Workshop Support has been added for mods instead of just campaigns. One technical aspect I REALLY appreciate is the fact that you don't have to manually forward any ports to host a server. Holy  only few have any idea how much of a pain in the  that is. I'm glad that ARMA just lets you host a server for your buddies, hassle free. Thank you, bohemia. Edit: Since gamespy went down this is no longer the case and you need hamachi. . All in all, I recommend this game highly, even at $60, which I will almost never do. But this game is so fully featured and refreshing that I find it hard to tell you to wait for a sale. But again, I cannot stress enough that this game is for the team player and the highly attentive. It is not for run and gunners or lone wolves. Movement is more likely to get you killed than save you most of the time. I've only put in 25 or so hours so far but I see myself playing this game for a total of hundreds in the future.

Review: If you do not own this, get downloading it (free weekend as of writing 26/10/14). This has millions of unique scenarios to offer. For me its playing with a community of 20-60 people (TAW.net) playing custom made coop missions with four squads, two platoon leaders, Command staff ect. Its organised and i've never experienced the feeling of completing an objective with tactics and low amounts of deaths in any other game. The game may have a few optimisation issues but it makes it up with the sheer scale. Air, land, sea, vehicular, foot, scuba diving, parachuting fun all in one game! Feel free to join us at www.taw.net! If you are playing it on the free weekend you will not get the full experience until you have played with a community,group! The mod support is amazing and the community is great with a range of casual to hardcore gamers all under one roof of one asthetically pleasing game that not only offers beautiful looks but amazing content also! I'd rate it 9/10 (with optimisation improvements it would be easy to increase that).

Review: this is a high quality sandbox game, it has everything to be unique. it has a HUGE map and another very large to. you can do squad missions, be the leader or to be a soldier and a squad member. this game is very interesting and it has vehicles which are very fun to ride, the combat is very interesting and sometimes difficult, if you want a game like counter strike or call of duty then go somewhere els! everyone must have writen that but i will write it to... the graphics are awesome! sometime it feels real so better have a computer that can run this cause i only have the minimum and i really like the game, if you reach max running then there is no bound to how much you will love the game. you can check if you can run the game at:http://systemrequirementslab.com/cyri single player is interesting and nice but the multiplayer is the real deal, you have a lot of servers with diffrent rules and attributes, you can drive with some people around the world and survive and you can go to the missions that the server gives you randomaly. for ending i really love the game and i want you will to! so if you dont want to spend 60$ then wait for a good sale.

Review: this is a high quality sandbox game, it has everything to be unique. it has a HUGE map and another very large to. you can do squad missions, be the leader or to be a soldier and a squad member. this game is very interesting and it has vehicles which are very fun to ride, the combat is very interesting and sometimes difficult, if you want a game like counter strike or call of duty then go somewhere els! everyone must have writen that but i will write it to... the graphics are awesome! sometime it feels real so better have a computer that can run this cause i only have the minimum and i really like the game, if you reach max running then there is no bound to how much you will love the game. you can check if you can run the game at:http://systemrequirementslab.com/cyri single player is interesting and nice but the multiplayer is the real deal, you have a lot of servers with diffrent rules and attributes, you can drive with some people around the world and survive and you can go to the missions that the server gives you randomaly. for ending i really love the game and i want you will to! so if you dont want to spend 60$ then wait for a good sale.

Review: This game is amazing, I was worried that I would have bought a bad game for how much it cost, but it was really worth every penny. Out of 10 stars I would give it a 9.5, and the only reason its not 10/10 i sbecuase at first when I started playing it I had extremly low FPS, and I know i have a very good rig becuase i built it myself so i spent a couple of days trying to figure out what was wrong and frustration everywhere. After a while I set the games priority to high in the luanch options and some other tweaks to the game. Thankfully I'm experienced with computer hardware, but other people with no experience might have alot of trouble with it. Hopefully you guy scan fix that in some way? Other than that this game is 10 out of 10 would definitely recommend to anyone! I just finished playing it, and i started today. Yeah, 7 hours! :D I had a blast and i will tomorrow too!

Review: Fantastic Game!!! It really does need some patches, more weapons and animation fixes (Especially with reloading). But other than that, if you love extremely hardcore games (AND ONLY HARDCORE GAMES, THIS GAME WILL BE BAD IF YOUR GOING TO PLAY IT LIKE COD OR BF), then this is the game for you. Considering the state that its in, i'd give it an 8.5/10 . But when the DEV's fix the glitches and animations, this game will easily score at least a 9.5/10 for a Military Simulation. It has a very steep learning curve, but in 5 hours or so you should get the hang of it :D

Review: This is a huge improvement over Arma 2. The visuals, the gameplay, everything is better. There's a considerable amount of mods for this already, and the ingame editor is great for making your own missions. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great military simulator/sandbox.

Review: Lets start off by saying that, this game is great. Totaly worth all the money. Now this games does have its flaws. the controls are hard to get used to, almost every key on the keyboard is used for something, or multiple things. Also the game engine is broken. if you want this game you need to have one heack of a PC. On single player, full graphics, usually runs nice for me. i do have a GTX Geforce 660 TI and a 4.33 GHZ prosseser. but sometimes on single player, there are massive framerate drops. on multiplayer, running as low as this game goes, im getting about 20-30 FPS. But not always. And now lets get to some more good things. The vide and screen shots dont seem to capture what this game can really do. You can build your own battles, so much to do in multiplayer like regular battles to survivals to get a jjob make money and live your life out with the need to buy guns and fight the rebles and the cops, or be a reble or a cop. the underwater diving and submariens are fun. There is litearaly SO SO SO many gear types, clothes back packs guns attachments, and alot more. so yes, i do highly recomend this game, but only if you have the PC for it.

Review: Great game when played with the right group of people. Single player campaigns, while challenging, can be a little dull after a while, but this seems to be the way of life for games these days. EDIT 16/05/2014 - The new campaigns added since i left my review have made the world of difference. Changes have been made to the game itself and it looks, simple beautiful. There are lighting effects that make your choice of where you shoot from and approach your enemy critical. Arma 3 is simply awesome, and if you're the kind of player to expect one shot kills with an assault rifle from 100m, then go and play COD, because you will be sorely dissappointed. If, however, you`re after a genuine challenge of realistic warfare, then get this game, convince some buddies to join you, and get tactical!

Review: Arma 3 is a great game, making many improvements on Arma 2. But it does'nt feel like its finished yet, I know it's still being updated but as its out of beta I thought it would have more than what is has at the moment. Saying that it's still worth a pick up.

Review: I really love this game. There is some glitches though not that much and is very fun to play with friends or teamamates. There are things like role-playing servers where you have to act just like you act in life and another is wasteland which is just trying tu survive. You need to find your stuff and survive, I really like this game and I could play it for days striaght without stopping because it's just so fun. Add me as a friend and we could play Arma 3 sometime , I am always on :)

Review: Playing Arma 3 in a tactical manner alongside random people you don't know, assigned to different squadrons fulfilling different roles on the battlefield is among the most rewarding multiplayer experiences I've had in gaming in a very long time. Highly recommended combat sim, immersive and lots of features, combat stances, etc. 9/10

Review: So far it's pretty much the best milsim out there, bar none. I do wish for a mod to include realistic reloading animations and a mechanic that recognizes bullets in the chamber. Negatives are the extreme amount of Wasteland servers out there, and complete lack of proper pvp servers that are friendly for playing without friends. For better or worse, unless you, for some inexplicable reason, actually LIKE the Wasteland mod, you're better off playing the co-op servers where it's you, 20 or so other folks, customizable loadout ammo crates, and places on the map to clear of enemy AI. Game looks good, and it's a real treat for such a milsim to look good, and have alot of potential draw distance.

Review: ARMA 3 is very different from ARMA 2, It is not a game for people that want fast action gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the small things, this game requires patience and tactical skill, There are experiences in ARMA 3 that you will not experience in Battlefield, or Call Of Duty, for example the tactical aspect of ARMA 3, if your lucky enough to be part of a tactical community then you can get the full benefits of playing ARMA 3, not like wasteland or altis life. ARMA 3 has burst up from the old ARMA's from the help of Dayz, i'm not saying Dayz game arma all the populatrity but it defintly gave them the boost they needed. I remeber when i first joined a tactical server, i was a noob, i had no clue what these call signs ment, or any command chain. But i was rushed to a heli and placed into bravo squad, i was told to stick next to the medkit, when i look back i think i chose the marksman load out, i was not very useful to the group in till we revived a lot of heavy fire, once are squad lead went down, it was just me and the medic, as the medic couldn't go down i had to rush out into the feild, dragging theese random people back to cover, now i did not know any of theese people, but in the moment it felt like i did, i felt like i was part of the team. Once i dragged half of my bleeding team out, i was assigned a special job, i was given satchel charges to blow up the objective, when i came up to the tower i had a little trouble setting it, but never the less i manage to place down the charge, as i ran back in a big rush to the heli evac, i looked around and saw the tower blow, it came crashing down into the hill. At the moment i relised this is what ARMA 3 is ment to be like. 9.5/10 -Lewis

Review: I love this game! When it works... Lately I've been unable to play multiplayer (any type of singleplayer mode works fine) as it just causes my computer to freeze when I join a "lobby". It forces me to quit the game through the task manager (doesn't always work) and even then causes things to not work at all forcing to do a restart. It's a shame as the game itself is amazing... Sadly there doesn't seem to be any clues as to why this is happening or of a fix, even though there are several reported instances of this happening from many other people. Hopefully someone figures out the cause of this and it get's fixed.

Review: Probably one of the best FPS, military simulator, with endless user add-on and mods I have ever played in my life. It's to the point this game is the only one I still play. It's far from Call of Duty and sort of reminds me of the old Battlefield games but better. I give it a 10/10 not for the game only but the the continuous community and their mods.

Review: I can't complain, this game delivers on what I was exspecting. I have all other games in the Arma series aside from a small few of the Arma 2 expansions. I love the ballistics, you get a more realistic feel for how a real firearm operates. There is much more to take into account than your simple fps. The series is great and worth a try, the controls can be intimidating but they are managable if you invest some time in training and getting a feel for it. This is a simulator so things are gonna be alot tougher than your typical war game. The AI friendly AI could use some more fine tuning and tweaking, I have had to put a few bullets into a couple insubordinate AI team mates for laying fire on targets a 1000 meters away thus helping bring more aid and attention to the base we were originally assaulting. The game is not without its bugs, and it is also a heavy on your processor much like Arma 2 was but indeed it is definatly a step up in graphics. It could use a larger armory, but there is a great mod cummunity that works on things like that to help the process along. Can't wait to get my Saitek x55 Rhino pro H.O.T.A.S. to be able to enjoy the helicopters alot more.

Review: I absolutely love this game mainly for the mods to it. I really enjoy playing rounds of Battle Royale. It is even better with a few teammates. It can get pretty intense at times. I do like their Breaking Point mod. It can get pretty intense. 10/10 gameplay experience

Review: My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever. We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my SAW gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. "SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" he died after that. I cried and he respawned. I would recommend getting :)

Review: Arma 3 is a very diverse game with many different games modes and mods. Some of the popular gamemodes are King of the Hill, Battleroyale, and Wasteland. There are also many co-operative mission you can do with people if you choose to do so. You can instlal different mods like guns, vehicles, missions and other things. Then theres Breaking Point a mod that involves zombies (be warned it is a very big download like 20+ GB) it can be hard to survive people and most people will try to kill you so be warned. Last note is there is going to be a Arma 3 Epoch Namalsk map coming.

Review: There is nothing more to say about Arma III than WOW. Ive been an owner of every single installment in the franchise from the days of the original Operation Flashpoint. The leaps and bouds that the developers have made over the course of the years is astounding. Arma III is absolutely astonshing as an improvement from the rest of the series. Its far less buggy than its predecessor and is updated very regularyl. The multiplayer capabilities are awesome and you can lose many hours with your friends developing all kinds of scenarios. If you were a fan of any of the previous games this one will not dissapoint.

Review: This game was a bit frustrated after Counter Strike, but after a few hours of playing, I realised, it is not so bad. It is a totally different, and I must learn how to play this game. After a while, I understand, the flow of the game, so now I like it much better. I recommend this game, for those, who like open area combats, and slow gameplay compare to Counter Stike. It is more like real world.

Review: Don't mistake this game for an FPS, some people enter into this game expecting COD ...it's not. ARMA is a full battlefield simulator which it does well at. In ARMA you're not meant to feel invincible, if you don't take cover you'll die, if you don't communicate with your squad you'll die. It has an insane learning curve that will take most people a long time to get used to, but only makes it very satisfying once you finally figure out how to fly or use artillery or...anything. The complicated controls at first can seem annoying but once you're used to them you'll be grateful you can stick your head up just enough to see an enemy out of a window without exposing your whole body. The games mod-ability makes it possible to play an infinite array of game modes making it difficult to get truly boring. While there is a battlefield like mod called king of the hill the size of the maps alone makes the game vastly more complex and that's saying nothing of the array of vehicles that can completely alter the game from just one player knowing how to fly or range a sniper rifle. Unfortunately the ARMA engine is well known for how glitchy it can get, Most of this has been ironed out and the presence of hackers ruining servers has been greatly reduced since early access. At times clipping through a wall or falling through the floor of a building still happens but it's not so common that it ruins things. At the end of the day the game requires being patient and on your toes while communicating what you see with teammates. The different mods and game modes give the game infinite potential but the glitches can create issues sometimes. ARMA 3 is a military sim not "insert FPS here" don't get attached to scores and if you find yourself complaining over global that someone using a plane is "cheap" or a "noob" close the game and reevaluate who you want to be in life.

Review: While i would reccomand this game... I am dissapointed in bohemia interactive for making the game more arcady then the previus ARMA 2 Game. While the controlls ware refined and improved. the graphial fadality is amazing. The game lacks in content. And optimization. A major issue being the fact that if the server host is experiancing 8 FPS. So will you. no matter how many nividia TITANS you rig together. And how many I7's you overclock to . While ArmA 3 is alot more complex. engaging. And immersive then olther tittles out there. Such As Carl On duty Black cops. And Battlefield. It is indeed a thinking mans game. Where map reading. Team co ordination. And communication are key. It does not acheve the level of immersion and simulation that ArmA 2 With mods such as ACE and ACRE acheive. I defenitly reccomand the game to newcommers to the arma series. But ArmA veterans may be dissapointed. To newcommers. ArmA arma allways had quite alot to take in. To learn. to unlearn things you are used to doing in first person shooters. It requires them to learn to use their compass to alert friendlies of contact. How to operate as a team. And even how to operate their weapon system in a proficent manner. Accounting for distance and target movement. But somethings will be new even to arma vets. Such things as the Stance Adjust system, And the awful arcady grenade throw. bound to G. To any arma 2 Vet trying to fiddle with his gear. Thats bad news.

Review: THIS is an AWESOME game to play. The developer team is really caring about the community. The workshop and map editor helps you to do a LOT of things that no other games can. The hardward requirement is pretty high and you will not get the best experience if you can only run on low or medium. PLUS, if you one of those people who play COD or battlefield a lot, you may need a few hours to L2P this game. ARMA 3 is seriously an simulation game, any gun can pretty much 2 shot or 1 shot you at any distance(and the AI is pretty good at aiming). Stay in cover, move quick and you will enjoy this war on the island.

Review: Let me start off by saying this game is great and the workshop makes it 20x better. But in order to give a good review I must give both sides of the story. This game is very complex and can be intimedating for the noobie, but one of the greatest parts about this games loyal comunity is that no matter how stupid a siduation might be, they will still role play it out. That is partially why this series seems so realistic, the community is great. Of coarse there are always those people who would rather complain about how bad someone is instead of helping them to become better. But most people are willing to help with anything you might need. The next thing is to learn the controls. It will make your life so much easier, there may seem to be many controls, but you only use a few of them unless you are a commander. Also this game is beautiful and usually runs desently well on a mid range pc. Now I must give the downsides. The campaign is ok but it is not arma 2 quality. That is the main theme here is that it is not arma2. I dont know why but this game is missing something that both arma2 and arma cwa nailed. It seems more directed and controlled that previous installments of the series. One will need a mid range ish pc to run this game. All in all this is a great game with a wonderful community and it has endless mods from the workshop so if you are debating weather to get the game or not, let me make the decisioin for you. Get the game.

Review: This game is like being underwater. But the water has been replaced by feelings of isolation, claustrophobia and bullets. Bullets hatefully fired at your face by nameless and unseen minions. And these bullets don't stop. Until you stop...moving.

Review: Fantastic game 9/10. Visuals are amazing on any setting above medium. Style of gameplay is completely up to you. Replayability is infinite. Audio is brilliant. The only downfall is the AI (If you have no mods on), the settings for their skill levels needs a bit of refining. It's either they're as dumb as a stump or so smart that they drop you before you can even get ready. Definitely recommend.

Review: I recommend this game to anyone who likes a more realistic type of shooter. This game also has a big modding community so there are tons of different ways to play the game. Controls are most fluid then Arma 2 and it feels more natural and less mechanical. It does still have a slight mechanical feel but that just goes with the genre. Every act requires you to take a second to complete that task just like RL. I didn't log many hours when i first got it but iv recently found servers that run the SC (Sector control) game mode and its fantastic. You gain levels by being in the target sector and money to buy new gear. Il keep this brief but its a great game and keeps getting better with every update.

Review: This game is definately not your standard cod run and gun type of game. You are forced to use tactics and the enviroment around you to gain the advantage and with all the multiplayer content as well as custom missions/mods you will never get bored.

Review: ARMA 3 So when I saw this game for the first time, I thought that soon will release another excellent piece ArmA. However, the first disappointment was already in anticipation, as the extremely small amount of technology and absence campaign. But this disappointment disappeared when issuing the first chapter of the campaign was excellent and the new technique also appeared. But I will not criticize. I must say that the guys from Bohemians are struggling and working hard to repair, etc. Graphically it's a big shift but a new engine this could offer more. The playing area is huge and real and opens new possibilities for mods. Technical equipment and weapon was terrible at the beginning and the newly added equipment was broken but gradually improves and fixes. Despite this, however, it is compared ARMA I and II, step backward. Personally, I think that would Bohemia Interactive could use a better future. On the other hand, however, the campaign is excellent, what more can I say. Final verdict: ArmA III is an improved forward, but it is incredibly untapped potential. If it Bohemia Interactive put in the time and dedicated technicians and armor, or even a new engine, so it would be something completely different, much better. 8/10

Review: Perfect sim for those wanting something more than casual games such as COD or Battlefield offer. Arma II is still the big boy, but 3 is shaping up to match or exceed the older (but still massively popular) sim. The engine is a bit smoother and the setting more futuristic, but other than that, it plays very similar.

Review: I Gladly dropped part of my paycheck on this game, and ever since its release it has kept me entertained through the various gamemodes it offers. If you do happen to get tired of Wasteland, Altis Life, etc you can check out armaholic, and download many more mods and missions to work with. The game does have its bugs, but in reality every game does. They may or may not get said bugs worked out, but we can only hope. If you want to screw around on a MilSim that has many things to offer Arma 3 is the game you want to pick up.

Review: The community is trash, its a mix of team killing, autism, and milsim faglords making  overly complicated. As usual with arma games the optimization is absolute garbage and no matter what you do, you wont hit 60fps consisstantly in online. The guns feel great but have the impact of a pellet rifle, especially the 9mm sidearm NATO gets. The story doesnt make sence but its arma, you dont play it for the singleplayer (i was very disapointed however that the singleplayer was not co-op like in 2). The only way to make this game good is by A) Having a squad that fits you, whether it be autistic milsims, people who are just playing to  around, or a mixture of both, who is in your squad ultimatily deterimines your fun B) MODS MODS MODS MODS. The massive amount of weapon mods spices up the gameplay with familiar faces like the AR platform and ak platform rifles. It makes the game much more realistic ironicly. C) Having lots of patience. Good luck finding a server that is consitantly good that doesnt have faglord admins (Ive been banned for saying "wat" isntead of "what", asking someone to turn down their mic, and using opfor weapons while playing as blufor). 6/10, 8/10 with mods Be advised, when you download mods, even if its something as small as a retexture, you will NOT be able to join 50% of the ing servers because arma doesnt like having us filthy modders join vanilla servers. So the servers will be split and you will be getting upset because of the lack of a filter between vanilla only and mod friendly servers.

Review: 1st/3rd person military shooter with vehicle combat. One of a kind "modern" military shooter, with very large battlefields. A lot of clothing, armor, weapon variations, weapon modifications, ammo types, grenades, utility tools and different kind of equipment. Large variety of civilian, military, armored ground and air vehicles. Game has great modding tools and support. Single player missions also included, as well as co-op and multiplayer modes. Game has great visuals, texture quality, animations, environments and good voice acting. Inventory is hard to navigate at first, and needs getting used to. You tend to die fast, and for some people it may be a challenge to stay alive. Game supports large player count on any given map. Personally I think this is good improvement over Arma 2.

Review: Very good game, I would highly recommend this to anyone that likes a semi-realistic war sim. This game struggles heavly from optimization issues. I have an i5 3570K at 4.4 GHz and a GTX 760. At best this game will use 60% of my CPU and or GFX card and only getting 25-40 FPS at 1920x1080 in a busy server. In single player I can get up to 80-90 FPS. Changing my GFX settings really wont change my FPS more than about 10%. 9/10

Review: A fun and addicting game for me. Started with just the campaign then started playing the Breaking Point mod which is the Arma 3 version of DayZ. Now playing Wastle land and Altis life. This game has a lot to offer and the community additions are great. I highly recomend this game if you are a fan of FPS games that actually want you to use some tactics.

Review: Arma 3 is a very fun game to mess about on but it is quite hard to play seriosly as the AI are absolute  and becuase crashing into a fence at 2 kmh in a car kills you. Apart from this it is a very fun game to play on Altis life but i wouldn't really recommend it that much who actually want to do millitary stuff on it.

Review: Fantastic improvement on Arma 2. While it is a military sim, and I'm still not 100% how to play the proper game modes, theres plenty for the adverage FPS player to make the most of. Gun game and Battle Royale to name a few,

Review: Arma is not a game, in the same way that a word processor is not a document. Want to play Call-of-Duty-level stuff? It's got that. Want to play RPG stuff? It's got that. Want to play survival horror? It's got that. Want to play a flight simulator? It's got that. This software's so good it will convince you to strap things to your head for headtracking and that this is perfectly normal. However, you will probably find you get the most out of this if you play with a clan. From we-want-to-pretend-we're-in-the-army level of committment to the it's-saturday-and-we're-drunk-and-on-the-internet level of committment to the we-have-small-children-and-this-is-what-we-do-to-chill-out levels of normality, there are clans out there for anyone's taste and needs. And hell, if you're a misanthrope, the singleplayer fun is still pretty damn awesome. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1PXJduNQdg

Review: Before playing this game you should ask yourself - what military operation would you like to play? Do you want to be a sniper? Do you want to be a part in a big combined arms operations? Do you want to ride a tank? Helicopter? Kart? Do you want to be a civilian and simply role-play your wild dreams? Do you want to play as a god? Really, there is not much to be said about ARMA that has not been said - yes, there are bugs, yes it is still a bit laggy, but it gets better. And it will get better because developers still update game and listen to fans feedback. You can have hundreds of mods, do whatever you want to do or simply follow missions. It is all up to you. This is main difference between other military shooters - it is a sandbox concept, which means you are buying lot of games in one.

Review: Awesome game. If you played Bohemia's other games in the series, Arma 2 and Arma 2 OA, then you HAVE to get this. The graphics are beautiful (although you need a good computer obviously to run it well) the combat still feels a little stiff, but it's a huge improvement from the last games. They added an actual working physics engine and the features (inventory system, gun attachments, etc.) are top notch. The use of tactic and strategy is required so if you like that kind of stuff then you'll like this. It's still a pretty early release so I'm sure they will be releasing more vehicles and guns soon. Also, it comes equipped with the steam workshop, which is amazing considering steam's community is great at making modifications that make the game ten times better. Just get the damn game already!

Review: This game has it's ups and downs. It has greatly improved since its official release as it was extremely dissapointing (lack of Altis servers, Altis servers had no guns or vehicles or rarely any, no mods, campaign was not available at start (I did not care but to many they cared), and many optimization and bug issues)). All issues have been pretty much addressed and fixed, but there are issues that can still be fixed as they include an issues tracker in which you can report issues and recieve feedback from developers and users. Forgetting the few issues it has it is still a great tactical military simulator that you can enjoy with yourself, your clan, or your friends. This game definetly became an all-time favourite for me as the graphics look beautiful, even if you play on low, and gameplay is quite realistic to any other game.

Review: The best $60 I've spent. This game offers SO MUCH content for the money, it's ridiculous. Not only is the campaign challenging and pretty interesting, but the multiplayer game modes that come stock with Arma are a blast. But on top of this, it has incredible mod support where players have literally created their own new maps, brought maps like Chernarus from the original Day Z mod, added weapons that weren't in the game via Bohemia's addition, vehicles, enemies, etc. It is incredible. Whatever you want to do, as long as it's in the realm of guns or cars, there's a f**king mod out there for it. And that alone makes it worth full price, any time. This game makes all AAA titles charging $60 + more for DLC look like . If you think you can hang and stay aware of your surroundings, buy A3. It's fantastic.

Review: I recommend this game to anyone who craves for a slower-paced tactical simulator. About 80% of the time, you will spend travelling to the location you need to liberate or scouting the area for hostiles. Even then, you are not guaranteed killing anyone. You may get one or two kills if you are lucky. That being said, I love this game. I prefer it to Call of Duty or Battlefield because of the realism. The ballistics in this game is possibly the most realistic compared to most shooters nowadays. Many of the people who play the game are either in the military or military enthusiasts. That being said, prepare for the annoying 'support our troops' people. However, if you can get past them you will appreciate the game for what it is. A lot of the combat is mid to long range (unlike most modern FPS's). You will often witness your teammates shooting at 'nothing' only to zoom in with binoculars and realize they're shooting at hostiles a kilometer away. The game requires you to be on your toes most of the time and to be prepared for nothing. In the 5 hours I played this game (at the time of writing this), I experienced about 4 or 5 unique events that you could only experience in a multiplayer game. I was in a helicopter that had the engine shot from an enemy machine gunner. We crash landed in the middle of nowhere only to be ambushed by enemy troops. Myself, the pilot and two other guys were able to take out all the enemies and request evacuation from another helicopter pilot. One of our guys was hit and was on the ground bleeding so a medic arrived at the scene and patched him up as well. That may not sound exciting to a gamer that's used to the arcade-style shooters but the accurate physics and realism in this game is what makes it exciting. The very fact that this event occurred is rare (it only happens once in a lifetime, maybe if you're lucky). Anyways, enough chatter. Buy this game if you enjoy tactical shooters that have an emphasis on teamwork (ie. working as a squad, as a battallion and as an army).

We enter the AO in the heli. We begin talking fire from both sides. One shot takes out the back rotter. All you hear is JUMP NOW! Only 3 of my group jump out and the rest blow up in the air. I land in a tree and my two other group members are no wear to be found. We meet up only to be BLOWN UP by a nade. 12/10 Nades

Review: Arma 3 is a really niche experience. It is refreshing to play an Arma game when the market is so saturated with MW type military shooters. To truly appreciate the realism and immersion of Arma 3 you have to find a good server to play on. I have not played a game in recent memory that provides the realism that this one does and the community is really the driving force behind that. The gameplay is solid, but the learning curve is somewhat larger than your average shooter. Combat is not in your face, but tends to be long range engagements that last a significant amount of time. The single player options are decent, and provide a good means for learning the game, but you should not buy this game if you are looking for a single player experience. My only other significant complaint is how poorly optimized this game is. It is a pretty game, very pretty actually, but it runs so poorly on even decent rigs that it can become quite frustrating. 7.5/10

I have not played a game in recent memory that provides the realism that this one does and the community is really the driving force behind that. The gameplay is solid, but the learning curve is somewhat larger than your average shooter. Combat is not in your face, but tends to be long range engagements that last a significant amount of time. The single player options are decent, and provide a good means for learning the game, but you should not buy this game if you are looking for a single player experience. My only other significant complaint is how poorly optimized this game is. It is a pretty game, very pretty actually, but it runs so poorly on even decent rigs that it can become quite frustrating. 7.5/10

Review: Thought about buying this for a long time. Arma 2 was great, but i wasnt sure if this was any good. If you haven't played Arma 3, buy it now. You wont believe what kind of situations occur there.

Review: Arma 3 is a shooter that breaks the Arcade FPS paradigm, the versatility of this game engine and features presented therin are absolutely unmatched. Worthy of the title "military simulator" completely. Fly aircraft, drive vehicles, logistics with team strategy, tact, and disciplin this is the closest to a real combat environment you can get without selling your self to the man. Other big title shooters out there have gone the way of the "run and gun shoot em up" arcade styles and require very little forethought. If you desire an experience that will rock your fiber, and boost your blood pressure all the while training your brain? Arma 3 is the game for you!! Much recommended for sensible, mature players.

Review: Great game, I like the King of the Hill mode, they seem to be improving it really well. just a lot of buttons, and the steam workshop is a nice touch. Only downside is this games horriable engine. The engine its self is from 2001 and its been pushed beyond what it can really handle on the clients side. Once you start to add about 20 AI or players the engine starts to use the CPU or Video card less and less cuasing a performance drop. I seen maybe 30% CPU/GPU usage on a 106 player King of the hill match with 30 - 35fps hile on armory I can pull well into the 80's with a few players. Thats my only gripe about this game. If they would fix that then I would have no complaints at all.

Review: I found solitaire more fun 1. scopes dont zoom propely 2. multiplayer games are boring and have no point to them.. If you enjoy running around empty land gettin randomly shot by nothing and getting kicked out for no reason its great 3. No way to communicate with others in multiplayer and single player would be better if controls worked Jus glad i did the free weekend and not wasted 30 bucks like i was going to

Review: Lots of fun, definitely better than Arma II plays more like an fps, since it doesn't feel as clunky as arma II was. you can attach and remove scopes and ammunition without using ammoboxes, it is better trust me. ING AWESOME.

Review: 'Twas good to play a very nice FPS game with good mechanics, graphics, sound and design. Always adored the ArmA series for its fair realism. Only thing I have against this game is the fact that the enemy AI has pinpoint accuracy and includes a bullet sponge feature, while your squadmates have absolutely no accuracy compared to the enemy and they seem to die as fast as the player. Then again it might just be a quirk that I haven't caught up on. Great piece!

Review: My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever. We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my SAW gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. "SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" he died after that. I cried and he respawned. I would recommend getting :)

Review: My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever. We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my LMG gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?

Review: This is a game where you can do what ever you want. Make it a FPS by playing TDM or make it a Role playing game by playing mods or 'life' no matter what age you are you will enjoy Arma 3. The best one out of the series and I would buy this game for my friends! (Just make sure your rig can run it though otherwise it gets a little less fun!)

Arma 3 modded is one of the most enjoyable milsims out there and I fully recommend it as long as you don't mind spending first few hours hooking up mods and scenarios which make the game infinitely more fun with huge amount of replay value.

Review: What's not to like about a true military tachtical First Person Shooter. ARMA 3 delivers a excellent game that does just that. This is not your typical run around killing spree like most FPS games lead people to beleive. With it's extensive maps, ARMA 3 gives gamers a vast variety of landscapes, dynamic scenery including day to night trasistions. In ARMA 3 you need to slow it down and take your time or your self dead with no chance to respawn. NO RESPAWN? that's right, realism is a real as it gets. But don't worry, respawns can and do exist. But sometimes it's better to wait for a medic, if one is available. Trust me when I tell you that ARMA 3 is as real as it can get.

Review: If you are looking for something to do. If you are bored. If you like some resistance. If you really like teamwork. If you don't like teamwork but can be around people. THIS IS THE ULTIMATE GAME!!! You will always have something new to learn, fix, repair or just curse with this game! In game, you can create what the duck you what. Trying to install mods, it takes time and is super complicated and rarely every functions properly, but in the end it's worth it. I have yet to see a more complicated but fun game to play with people. Even if you are a lone wolf and just wants to sit on a hill and shoot people while your friends are running Rambo in a town. Just saying... 2000+ hours in A2, 1000+ hours in A3, and I never feel like giving up on arma. I would marry this game. Because I would have the same complicated arguments with a wife as with this game. 12/11.9 points!

Trying to install mods, it takes time and is super complicated and rarely every functions properly, but in the end it's worth it. I have yet to see a more complicated but fun game to play with people. Even if you are a lone wolf and just wants to sit on a hill and shoot people while your friends are running Rambo in a town. Just saying... 2000+ hours in A2, 1000+ hours in A3, and I never feel like giving up on arma. I would marry this game. Because I would have the same complicated arguments with a wife as with this game. 12/11.9 points!

Review: This game is the best Arma game in the entire series it is truly an amazing game. The graphics are suprisingly good and the gameplay is very fun especially if you like realisic war games that takes teamwork and strategy to stay alive. But I would not recomend this game to the daily Call of Duty fan boy guy, this game is slow paced and takes LOTS of strategy and teamwork, unlike Call of Duty's run and gun and lone wolf type of game. If you are familiar with Arma 2 this is everything you love with better graphics and physics, for example. Arma 2, you shoot a man he stands there for a sec then falls down and dies with no blood affect. Arma 3, you shoot a man he realistically falls (some what rag doll physics) and there is a realistic blood affect. Overall I think the game is great and I give it a 10/10.

Review: It was just a normal day in Invasion and Annex (A coop gamemode entirely community made that teams up the whole playerbase against AI, usually 50 as the player cap), I had taken Explosive Specialist and I was waiting at base to get teamed up with a squad. And holy I couldnt of gotten a better one. First delpoyment was a cakewalk, so we decided to just get dropped off near the objective without ressuplying at base. "We will take an airdrop" they said. So we half-resupplyed along the way. The next thing we know, we have been pinned down and holding our ground by literally all of the enemy forces in the point since the other squad wasnt doing a good enough job. Our medic got killed by a granade launcher, we ran out of first aid kits. So we threw some smoke and dragged the wounded away while me and our machinegunner covered, it was chaos. We held for about 20 minutes until ing base finally decided to send in medical evac. But not even that, instead of a chopper to get us out of that ing place, they sent another medic. At that point, I had ran out of ammo and was borrowing HE granades from the squad leader to use as mortars for targets that were 500 meters away. Somehow we managed to push into the village, kill everything, and evac. I dont think a game has made me consistently feel knees deep in  for 2 hours or so. If you like to get shot down from the sky by AA guns and having really ing cool scenarios, get this game right now. TL;DR enjoy being pinned down by troops for hours while you have no supplies and your allies back at base are circle jerking. Buy it.

Review: I wrote a review for this game quite a long time ago, but by now that I think about it I like playing Arma for none of the reasons that I had talked about. Previously I had talked about the mechanics that Bohemia had put into the base game, but I've now come to realize that Arma has become one of those games that are instead defined by the people that play it and mod it. You can take my word for it that Arma is well worth your time if you get a group of talented players/scenario creators, but if you need more proof then allow me to ramble on about a particularly rememberable instance that was thanks to the group I happened to have found, if for nothing else but to write a 'love letter' to people so gratious enough to let me tag along. The scenario of the day was as follows: Me along with the rest of our group of about six were highered by the powers that be within NATO and the US (cus reasons I assume) to go to some base on some island to find something. Don't worry, we would know it when we see it. They gave us an A-10 and several helicoptors of sorts so it was expended to run into a lot of unfriendly locals. We were also told not to take anything larger then 7.62 or Homing. So we ended up with a pilot on call, a Squad Leader, MG gunner, a guy with a handy dandy target designator, a medic, and myself. Given that I often times opt to do medic duties I was lost for a role, so I just picked up the highest caliber, semi-automatic sniper I could find, slapped a suppressor and scope on it and went with everyone else to the helicoptors. The pilot checked the helicopter to make sure everything was fine, while we sat in the back making jokes. "I went to Chasington once," someone yelled over the helicoptors rotors. "It was like this!" After an uneventful ride to the forested area we were to land, we make our way up a small hillside to overlook the adjacent valley. Directly in front of us we find a small house surrounded by troops and an armored car. They seem to outnumber us. We each pick a target, mine being a man barely visible behind a window. The fight would begin on the SL's word. After a few seconds he stands up from our position and lets loose a grenade towards the truck, followed in quick succession by my rifle shot and the MG to finish up the rest. In a matter of a few noisy seconds and some well placed shots we clear the house. Then another group on the hillside opposite ours tears into us for tearing into their friends. Immediately we lose our Designator, along with the MG and myself taking a round while we all retreated to a rock for cover. The SL gets on his radio to talk to our Air while me and someone else fire back at the two guys shooting us. We both drop them after a minute, and our very frazzled selves make it to yet another hill that overlooks the base, bringing the armored car with us. I will say this about Arma, they manage to make some impressive views when it comes to scale. When we crested the hill we could see for miles across a sparsely wooded valley with a town and military base at its end. The base was our target. And next to our target was a very scary, and very operable Self-Propelled gun guarded by some troops. We all collectively  a brick foundation and the SL gets on his talkie to radio the A-10. The pilot tells us he'll be there in five minutes and to keep the tank lazered. Good thing we grabbed the designator off our dead guy. To pass the time we muse about the tank, how many people are in the valley, and what the A-10 run will look like. I hobble over to the guy holding the designator and ask him for the range to the infantry. I provides a number and I range the rifle. The A-10 begins to swoop in and we can barely hear it. We can however see two bombs drop from its wings and impact the tank. The plum of fire reaches forty meters in the sky. We all cheer a bit and plan our next move off the hill and to the base. The pilot tell us there are dozens of guys in the base so we decide to hang back for a bit. "Hey, can I take a shot at those guys by the tank?" I ask our SL. "Go for it." With immeasurable glee I grab up the new designator guy and make him my spotter. He constantly gives me the distance to the group of guys running to the tank. I take aim at the lead man and fire off a shot that explodes on the guy's upper body, sending him backwards. As the designator makes a comment about the hit I take aim at the second guy and fire off three more shots. One of them impacts the guy in the leg and he falls to the ground. Satisfied, and with new orders to get in the truck I stop shooting. Unbeknownst to us there are atleast fifty people coming up the hill at us after that airstike. In the interest of time lets just say that we got pretty shot up and retreated back a ways with three out of the original five that landed. After quite some time we get some reinforcments and grab another, much larger helicopter to take us right to the base. Apparently we were running out of options. Its me and the newly spawned Designator dangling over the Chinooks back ramp, our SL and MG gunner on the two guns and our medic in the center. Halfway to the base our medic 'falls' out of the helicopter and manages to safetly land somewhere with a parachute. We have a laugh about it and start to fly over the base. Round start to ping off the sides of the heli as our pilot yells for the side gunners to shoot back. The sparadic firing escalates to a full on machine gun barrage right up at us. Round start to ping around the rear ramp and into the cargo bay. The guy next to me on the ramp takes several rounds and falls out of the back. The pilot yells that we have a fuel leak and we rapidly descend towards the dirt. We impact the ground and thankfully don't explode. Yet. The pilot yells for everyone to get out. We spread out and deal with the few stragglers that are still shooting at us. We weight our options and decide to just walk into the base. As carefully as possible we sneak into the base, taking a round in our direction here or there. After entering the main gate we are greeted by the rotting welcoming committee. In the base's assembly area are about fifty dead bodies and some blown out vehicles. Thank god for air support. We move up to the building and assemble at the front door. Someone inside fires a shot through the door and we rethink our decisions. We decide to throw every grenade we have through the door to the hiding troops. Afterwards, me and the pilot charge into the house and double tap the guys inside. We then start to look around for whatever it is we were supposed to find. They were right, we would know it when we see it. We grab as much of it as we can each hold and haul  out the way we came. We leave in such a hurry no one notices that our MG gunner takes a shot and dies a little ways from the gate. We regroup near some trees on our way to a car nearby. We look back to see where our gunner is, but a round hitting the tree by us convinces us to leave on the car anyways. I jump into the driver seat with the pilot in the passenger spot and the SL riding in the back. I haul  down the road to get away from the base. After awhile we slow down, have a laugh about everything, and the pilot directs me back to base. For continuitie sake the mission apparently ended as follows: the people who hired us said they weren't gonna pay us for finding their package, but our SL threatned to tell on them about what was actually inside. They shut up, pay us, and we go on our merry and blood-soaked way. A funny end to a great time of a scenario created by the pilot. Since then he's made and found a lot more. Sometimes in these scenarios I'm on a .50 cal covering a squad, sometimes I'm defusing an IED in the middle of a crowded street as people watch me, and sometimes I'm even leading a squad. However, thanks to the group I play this game with, it is never dull.

Review: This game was terrible in Arma 2 it hogged your computer, it destroyed your computer if you had it on HIGH all around. The devs fixed that! They added more content, a brand new DLC pack coming out, servers with variety of gameplay, scenarios and ideas. The editor is fun to mess around with, the singleplayer is coming to a great story. Zeus is going to make the gameplay massively expanded! Think of everything peopel can do. Thats why this game is amazing.

Review: A really interesting sandbox. Basically build a story on your own, or play other player-made maps... Includes normal deathmatch, coop story games and anything that can be made with your imaginations(requires some level of programming though) Only for those who are willing to learn how to play and not just point and kill, like counter-strike. Recommend to play as a group.

Review: Well what I like about it is that it is a Military Simulator and that it has so many different game modes. But what I really hate about it is that the price is to steep. I would recommend lowering the price down to $30-$40 or somewhere in between for about a week. That would really boost sales and I know I will buy it.

Review: The graphical beauty of this game is incredible and the game is among the most realistic combat games out there. However don't be mistaken this is by no means in the same catagory as other gun games out there. This does not play like an FPS at all, which in many cases I like. My only complaint with the series is how rough the game is with almost everything you do. Not going to rant on about it, but anyone who plays this can't deny that nothing you do flows very well, getting in a vehicle or doing something like hopping over a fence isn't quick and smooth. It almost feels like it stops the gameplay or combat... gets in the vehicle ...then it resumes. (hard to explain this given that makes it just sound like every other game but trust me when I say it isn't the same) NOW TO MAKE UP FOR THAT COMPLAINT, the game is fantastic, you really do feel like a soldier, and the range of gamemodes you'll find on servers etc. is endless! Finally to wrap it up they give you two massive maps that allow for very fun fights.

Review: Unparalleled realism. Amazing graphics and sound that take advantage of higher end machines. Gameplay so intricate and suspenseful - the only true war SIMULATOR. The modding community shines, with great missions from specifc PvE sets, to PvP battles, to full on RPG's. It might not be the most fast-paced shooter - but when a well cooridinated assault kicks in, the fireworks can make the most over-the-top blockbuster shooter sequences look like cartoons. The suspense of being killed with one shot, of not knowing whether or not you've been spottted, or trying to overwhlem an attacking or defending force provides tangible investment in your gameplay. The realism of the weapons, vehicles, and physics simply has no competition. If you want real, and NOT arcade, this is the ticket. This game thrives when playing with other communicating humans, and therein provides a war game experience that is addictingly engaging and entirely unique to ArmA.

It might not be the most fast-paced shooter - but when a well cooridinated assault kicks in, the fireworks can make the most over-the-top blockbuster shooter sequences look like cartoons. The suspense of being killed with one shot, of not knowing whether or not you've been spottted, or trying to overwhlem an attacking or defending force provides tangible investment in your gameplay. The realism of the weapons, vehicles, and physics simply has no competition. If you want real, and NOT arcade, this is the ticket. This game thrives when playing with other communicating humans, and therein provides a war game experience that is addictingly engaging and entirely unique to ArmA.

Review: Owned this game for some time. I absolutely love it! I play at a steady 60fps with vsync on. Running an old X58 system with a GTX 680 Classy! The mod "Breaking Point" has really made the game more enjoyable! I mean I never finished the campaign as I had to reinstall windows and progress is not saved from one OS to the next via steam! If you have the money it is very worth buying! VERY!

Review: Breathtaking graphics, fantastic gameplay, and a superior feeling to the controls since Arma II. The Mod community are already blowing up on this. For those who enjoyed Arma II this is a must buy. For those new to the Arma series, jump straight in on this, get mod'ing, get building scenario's and i guarrantee you'll never play CoD or Battlefield again.

Review: Well, after more than 450 hours on record, i have to say, it is THE best game in the last years! There is so much to do with it. Seemingly unlimited ways to modify the game or to make own missions with nearly unlimited access to everything you need! It deserves just one word: AWESOME!

Review: I m going to be honest, It isnt such good as arma 2. Despite better optimization,graphic and Zeus ( zeus is really good but its hard to use unofficial addons to run zeus correctly) is more drawbacks what i have to say. It wasn't fell like arma anymore, but like CoD or BF, unreal weapons(ammo, units, vehicles), body armor system ( the biggest problem at all in my opinion , it was probably mented like good think, but if you shoot soldier twice in chest, he cannot be able to return fire, ok, he MAY survive but that should be all). Positive think is FREE bootcamp ( but it doesn't fully support addons) what is sad... virtual arsenal loadouts re not able ti share in zeus. (when I said is positive, it was because its free, what is not common in nowadays). But you can as normal add addons and mods in arma, what makes it playable again. In result : Arma 3 is worth to buy for common player only because Zeus, nothing more have any value. If you re arma enthusiast (like me) and you are going to play arma 3 with mods and addons its good improvement after arma 2 (more support, more mod and addon makers, bigger maps).

Review: I've just now only started playing this and I must say it is AMAZING. "Best Military Sim" YES. 100x YES. The realism in this game is something out of a movie. It feels like you're there in the moment, like you're in the shoes of a soldier on the field. The campaign is short but has potential, the tutorial explains things minimally, but does suffice. Now to the fun stuff, the Multiplayer. My god, if you're someone who's wondering whether or not to buy this game solely based on it's Multiplayer, go right ahead and buy it. The people you meet online are so diverse it's crazy! I've met countless people on ARMA that were put in my situation and we learned the ropes together! It was quite the mess getting yelled at, but eventually we got it down. I'm in to shooters, but not really into sims, (Yet I love DayZ, whut) but this game really is something else. Fans of "DarkRP" from the famed GMod will find the ALTIS RP to be quite the upgrade from that, when playing it you can really feel the nostalgia from the DarkRP craze. Lastly, if you noticed this was made by Bohemia and think this game is as broken as DayZ, please, PLEASE, understand that this game is in no way shape or form like DayZ. The actual game is playable and so hard to put down when started. If you need help deciding on whether or not to buy this let this review help! Hope to see you in the RPG servers!

Review: Arma 3 is a game, with simulation elements. It's not a simulator. It is also a game for a specific type of gamer that prefers large scale warfare, instead of playing casual fast-paced shooters like COD or BF. If you enjoy the experience from briefing and planning , and executing a plan , no matter how it plays out, the game adapts to any playing style that fits your style. Run & gun still works, but you need to have some uber micro skills.. If your mission fails, Arma allows you to retreat and get out alive, or gives you the oppertunity to get it done in another way. That's a nice touch compared to games that usually let the game end right after a fail. (SP) A bullet in the head will kill you, a bullet in your ballistic helmet might save your life, get shot in your legs and you're have to crawl your way out of there.. Things you have to consider in real life come close to the decisions you have to make in this game. Playing multiplayer with a group of people make the experience even better, but this game isn't really 'finished'. While the tags say it's a full release, Bohemia keeps working for years on these games to improve and add more content. They've done the same thing to their previous titles. If you really care about Multiplayer, I suggest Arma 2 :CO. Pro/cons : + Mission Editor Large scale warfare Mods (Armaholic & Bis forums) Steam workshop - User Generated 'Mission' Content (Mods in future?) All kinds of vehicles (Air, Cars, Armor, Support, and so on) +270 km2 map to explore - Multiplayer performance still crap. AIR vehicle (MH-/AH-) lost turnspeed, please add a slider to have us configurate our own speed on pedals. Setting sensitivity to high, still have slow pedal movement >_< Those small choppers are able to quickly rotate , but now it's a slow , long and horrible turn. No co-op in Campaign?. (Co-op game plox!) AI moves unnatural (They behave like androids)

Review: Updated review: I have been exploring more features of Arma 3 and I love it! I have been playing a bit of the standard Arma 3 features which are fun, but the sheer number of mods and workshop missions is unreal! This game is so flexible. My most favourite mods and missions I have been playing are: Altis life: think along the lines of GTA, but everyone ever where is a real player, the police, military, bandits, civilians, criminals, everyone. It is a very immersive mission where you do what you want, whenever you want. Earn money through doing legal jobs, or become a criminal and traffic drugs, rob banks, rob other players, do whatever you want to survive, but beware your actions could get you on the police wanted list. Buy food, weapons, vehicles, licenses and so much more, it is a great experience when your on an active server. Escape Altis: an online coop game which can also be played single player, your goal to escape the huge island of altis. You will encounter AI enemy`s in all kinds of locations, choose how you get through, stealthy? Or guns blazing? Do it your way! This mission is very challenging and lots of fun, best with mates! Breaking Point: Think Dayz but on a bigger map, less glitches and now a choice of 5 factions to choose from. Each with their own perks, rules (or none depending which you choose), and appearance. Breaking point provides 5 maps, Altis, Stratis, Thirsk summer and Thirsk winter. The thirsk maps are PvP orientated with survival thrown in for good measure. Stratis is bigger than than Thirsk maps with a bigger focus on survival against zombies and other players. Altis is just huge! While breaking point is still in its infancy, the dev team is working really hard at it and adding new features and maps frequently. Vehicles in this mod are fairly rare, so expect work to be done finding them, you will also have to fix them up to get them working to. I love the Arma 3 engine, it is so flexible and allows for so many different ways to play, it just never gets dull. I highly recommend it!

Review: Updated review: I have been exploring more features of Arma 3 and I love it! I have been playing a bit of the standard Arma 3 features which are fun, but the sheer number of mods and workshop missions is unreal! This game is so flexible. My most favourite mods and missions I have been playing are: Altis life: think along the lines of GTA, but everyone ever where is a real player, the police, military, bandits, civilians, criminals, everyone. It is a very immersive mission where you do what you want, whenever you want. Earn money through doing legal jobs, or become a criminal and traffic drugs, rob banks, rob other players, do whatever you want to survive, but beware your actions could get you on the police wanted list. Buy food, weapons, vehicles, licenses and so much more, it is a great experience when your on an active server. Escape Altis: an online coop game which can also be played single player, your goal to escape the huge island of altis. You will encounter AI enemy`s in all kinds of locations, choose how you get through, stealthy? Or guns blazing? Do it your way! This mission is very challenging and lots of fun, best with mates! Breaking Point: Think Dayz but on a bigger map, less glitches and now a choice of 5 factions to choose from. Each with their own perks, rules (or none depending which you choose), and appearance. Breaking point provides 5 maps, Altis, Stratis, Thirsk summer and Thirsk winter. The thirsk maps are PvP orientated with survival thrown in for good measure. Stratis is bigger than than Thirsk maps with a bigger focus on survival against zombies and other players. Altis is just huge! While breaking point is still in its infancy, the dev team is working really hard at it and adding new features and maps frequently. Vehicles in this mod are fairly rare, so expect work to be done finding them, you will also have to fix them up to get them working to. I love the Arma 3 engine, it is so flexible and allows for so many different ways to play, it just never gets dull. I highly recommend it!

Review: If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob a bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.

Review: I came from FPS games like Call of Duty and Battlefield, those games are fun but in the end they are arcade style, they don't offer you a real taste of what it is really like to shoot a gun or being hit by a bullet. Red Orchestra 2 came a little closer to real combat, but Arma 3 is the most realistic military simulator ever. Despite the fact that it requires great effort to even kill someone with a gun (recoil, sight, stability, etc), it is fun to play this game. At least you understand you can't run across a map for 10 minutes straight, get hit by 10 bullets and still regenerate. This is the real deal. It's not too friendly to new players but the challenging aspect is intriguing enough to keep you going.

Review: Great game. IMO, more realistic than Arma 2, better graphics engine. I was able to run it in 1600x960p. Recoil is not that of a damn Barrett .50 cal when you are shooting a pistol. Cooler story and just overall an advancement from Arma 2. OP AF

Review: Have had this game for a while, near enough have 100 hours, i don't play the campaign but i do play the multiplayer and it is quite fun. Played on Invade and Annex with others and gave sniper cover over a valley. Played on Altis life and became a rebel killing cops. Played king of the hill and had to fight my way through the streets of Kavala. Long story short. This game is good, the SP and MP are both good, People are good but some can be annoying.

Review: This game is definitely a direct improvement over Arma 2. If you are familiar with that game, it is very easy to transition over to this game. I especially enjoy the mission editor. The mission editor has a pretty steep learning curve, but enough tutorials and trial and error will get you competent with the editor's logic. The game is much better optimized than Arma 2 was, but it still runs pretty awful on multiplayer, even with a high spec PC. I ended up having to turn down my view distance to a pretty low amount to consistently get 40 fps on multiplayer, because the fps largely relies on the server's power. On single player or a small server of 5-10 people, I could just about max out the game with a steady 60 fps. I am disappointed with the DLC though, as it really doesn't add much at all to the game at this point, and it retails at $25. I would recommend picking this game up, even if you have never played the other Arma games, because it seems like it has a much smaller learning curve than previous titles, but is still just as in-depth. This game is a good purchase, especially on sale, the DLC on the other hand is not currently worth it.

Review: Arma 3 is a big fail.Not in Alpha state but definitely not completed. Game changes from update to update,also addons stop working with new version.You might say it's normal because new version has fixed the bugs.Wrong again.New version go on conflict with addons that worked very well from day 1,as for bugs...stil not solved,very often fps drops and connection issues between client and server. Gameplay...LAME...for 2015 Arma 2 was a big hit. Arma 3 is another version on Arma 2 with "new" tweaks. Annoying DLC screen while flying in vehicles from DLC.

Review: This game is very poorly put together. Feels like the developers did a half-effort job putting it together and figured if a world existed, well maybe mods can make it a playable game. 3 hours of playing it was enough for me. What a terrible "game".

Review: Impossible to create COOP game (server is not responding/server is invisible, etc.) I don't wanna play on DEDICATED servers only. I wanna play with friends, in COOP mode. If it's impossible, the game does not make sense. It is useless to execute such game at all and waste a time. Also thanks to updates I am unable to finish CAMPAIGN maps in SOLO mode even once. Missing COOP mode with friends in CAMPAIGN maps. I dont wanna play CAMPAIGN against AIs only and as SINGLE person without COOP help of my friends. If COOP within CAMPAIGN is impossible, playing such a game is just a waste of time.

Review: Fantastic, huge open sandbox filled with the most abysmal, incompetent and down right dumb AI I've ever seen. I have over 70 hours of playtime on this and I have no idea why. It has potential for greatness but is ultimately just a hot mess of clunky controls and terrible systems. An example being your squad will often engage enemies that are specs on the horizon and go full auto on them. They will then precede to nag you constantly about having no ammo and will not rearm themselves at all. You litteraly have to get them to stand still, open their inventry and place any ammo clips you might have in their hands :-( This is just one tiny issue of hundreds that make it feel like an absolute chore to play. Its like baby sitting a squad of demented 6 year olds.

Review: Awesome and pretty realistic game. If you have an AMD setup do NOT buy this game ! If you have a 800$ pc do NOT buy this game because even on lowest settings you can't get more than 30fps other than the first 10 minuts of game then it drops half way down. If you are ok with games that run at 20 fps then you will be happy with arma 3.. since it sometimes run at 25fps. The amount of desync is insane so if you have the battlefield 4 getting killed gehind walls don't buy this game because it's even worse, literally . The huge FPS drops when there is an explosion is insane, and the sound crackling and making you drop to 5 fps is constant. The amount of times where you empty a mag on an enemy that just turns around and 1 shot you is prety common. If you have +1000$ build a intel setup with nvidia gpu and buy this game. Then buy a streaming pc if you want to stream. well if you have +1800$ actually and not 1000$ If you have +1000$ build a amd setup with ati gpu and DO NOT buy this game. Then buy any other game and play with +60 fps on ultra while streaming. The graphics and the resources this game demands makes no sense at all. Arma 2 looks as good if not better. Oh yeah there's ragdoll in arma 3 woohoo. No seriously. Do NOT buy this game, constant DLC that you have to pay for, optimization updates followed by lower performance... unless you have intel/nvidia setup. This game is based on x87... the most  thing to do. 3 years of dev and yeah... you get the picture. Just deleted the game myself, will never reinstall, will never recommend it and will never buy a game from Bohemia interactive in my life and will beat my kids uo if they buy one! JK or am i? game is at 50$ on steam and then you can spend 50$ on DLC (probably 50$ more when future DLC will be released) and 1400$ on a PC just to play this game. Isnt that just great?! Oh if you have some spare money after all this feel free to donate some to me so i can play a game that i bought 2 years ago when i had the same performance (~25fps) on my old dual core pc with gts 260 that i have on my 8350 with r9 270x setup.

Review: TL;DR: 1) Still has as many bugs as in Arma 2. 2) Better graphics. 3) Even less FPS. 4) The game only uses 1 core of your N-core CPU (no improvement, a bad thing overall) 5) 32-bit only: even more lags. 6) The developers made a huge focus on DLCs: not much content in the game itself (weapons/vehicles). Verdict: Wouldn't buy if I weren't a fan of DayZ-mod or Arma 2 Hello, dear, let me guess... Arma2/DayZ-mod fan? As of now, I have 833 hrs on record playing Arma 2: OA (primarily DayZ-mod and derivations). At the beginning of this review I'd like to write down my expectations before rating this modern game Many of you know (if you don't, it might actually be a good thing), ArmA 2, especially talking about the DayZ mod, had more bugs than the whole african tropical rainforest. Most of the bugs were depressing, but some were really funny and those became true insider jokes among my mates. Back to the "not-so-funny-bugs" and the laggy game engine which only could effectively use 1 CPU core (-> 70FPS at most on a 2011 mid/high-end PC). Those were the reasons I bought Arma 3. I wanted a better game, which has better graphics, less bugs and most important: higher FPS. Regarding these aspects: 1) Arma 3 has better graphics (what else would you expect?) 2 and 3) Bohemia Interactive did a great job on their part, applause. /sarcasm off: (surprisingly) Arma 3 still uses only 1 CPU core . Thanks, now I have even LESS FPS than in Arma 2. The average FPS for me is 15-30 and there's no way to increase the FPS. Firstly, because the CPU is the limiting factor (game uses max. 1.5 cores of total 4), so lowering the graphics settings doesn't change much. Secondly, RAM is still an issue. We now live in the 64-bit era. In case you didn't know, 64-bit applications not only can use more RAM (theoretically more than 4GB, on Windows more than 2GB) but also perform a little better (5-20%). As you guessed, Arma 3 is still running 32-bit only. This mainly results in heavy lags on my machine (same applies to Arma 2, but this is an old game, why bother?). After a while, when Arma 3 uses up all of the 2GB RAM provided by Windows, The Great Lag begins. Every now and then I get this Lag Spike, giving me 2-4FPS for a second or two. The game becomes practically unplayable (everyone with a better CPU have a huge advantage over you in terms of FPS). Teh tech explanation: When Arma 3 hits the allocation limit for 32-bit applications (Win32: 2GiB), it begins (or Windows does; doesn't matter) to offload additional memory objects to the pagefile.sys file, which is on your HDD. Hard drives are muuuuuuuuuch slower than RAM and everytime the game requests memory chunks from this file, you run into the 2-4FPS lag spike as the game has to sit here and wait for the data. Pagefiles on SSDs reduce the lag spikes, but don't :csgogun:eliminate them completely, so #blameBohemia #blameArma Now, what's about the bugs? It has got even worse probably. Vehicle damage has become unpredictable . A slightly damaged wheel? (that's what the HUD tells you). Visually still 100%, but the vehicle will crap out and drive at 70% speed, if at all. El helicptero with a fully broken main rotor? I DON'T CARE, STILL GOING UP IN THE AIR LIEK A GOD, ROFL-COPTER IS ON THE WAY. Next example: Playing King of the Hill (Fun gamemode with all vehicles and weapons). You are the pilot of a transport helicopter with 10 passengers in. A rocket hits your heli and it either goes down or explodes instantly, all good so far. So, what's about a little reward for the guy who fired that rocket and killed all the people in the helicopter? NOPE, ER! They all died because of magic/suiciding/Ebola-chan/african bees/ing cactuses. Again: We would like to politely inform you, the player who did kill all these innocent soldiers will not get any kills for that in reward. Do you still want to pay so much for a game? Don't forget, you'll need a PC costing at least 25 times as much to play the game comfortably.

Review: I got this in early access and waited until it was bug-free to play it. The game is just garbage. Everything is scripted so that you have to keep loading and saving to complete the campaign missions. Don't waste your money. The AI is non existent, like it was never programmed.

Review: It must be said again and again: The ArmA series is NOT compareable to any cinematic driven, action packed shooters! And if you don't like teambased multiplayer, you won't get too much fun out of it, since the singleplayer campaign seems to be more like an extra. This said, the third Armed Assault gives you everything you need for the most realistic and intense battle experience possible! You might complain about the near future setting, which made it even harder for me to leave my beloved Chernarus (ArmA 2) behind, but you won't stumble over pulse rifles et cetera. Furthermore you'll get a huge sandbox world, an editor to do in it whatever you want and a fine community that never sleeps! So, what else should I recommend right now? Buy it! Don't wait for more content and lower pricing, the war has already begun! Edit: Best Game ever! =) 777 hours edit: Nope. Not at all! ArmA 2 was so much better! This P2W-DLC system sucks balls dry! By the way: There's still absolutely no use for planes in this one! Best game ever? I've must been really drunk when I wrote that... I still recommend this one, but only 'cause it became nearly impossible to play A2 online.

Review: It must be said again and again: The ArmA series is NOT compareable to any cinematic driven, action packed shooters! And if you don't like teambased multiplayer, you won't get too much fun out of it, since the singleplayer campaign seems to be more like an extra. This said, the third Armed Assault gives you everything you need for the most realistic and intense battle experience possible!

Review: I've played Arma for a long time. But when mod developers ban you from their mod because of a VAC ban more than three or four years ago, that is absolutely stupid. If you like being banned by admins that were destroyed by you and your friends in a firefight, play this game. I was banned by an admin with the message " YOU LYSTICS" GG.

Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side.

Review: ArmA 3 is a fantastic simulation of military combined arms warfare, successfully creating an authentic envirmoment un-rivaled to any other and hightech modes of transport to visit every inch of it. Though you may need a high performance computer to run this game, even on the lowest settings you can enjoy it. From enthrawling hour long witchhunts on Wastelands to one of the best First Person Shooter campaigns of all time, im sure you will find something that you will look back on and say "That was freaking awesome!" Create your own mission and play with friends with the in-game editor, where you can achieve the same height of perfection as in the Official Campaign. I whole heartedly dont regret any of the hours that I have put into this game and would recomend it to anyone who is willing to play properly, as a team and is willing to follow the rules of the servers becuase when you do, the game turns into a multi-million pound movie in-which you are the main character and you choose what happens. "This game is bloody epic!"

Review: A true successor to ArmA 2. This is what a sequel looks like, rest of the gaming industry, not the same thing with a couple of improvements or "twists" that could have easily been patched in or sold as an expansion. Bohemia Interactive have shown that they are really dedicated to their craft, and that they really listen to the community, and what they want. If only there were more developers like these, along with Valve, and other notable examples. Improved physics, graphics, mechanics, fantastic soundtrack, modding support, mission editor, this is the military sim to rule all military sims, and it feels a damn sight more snappy than its predecessor too, which really tickled me gleefully. Of course, it still has a few optimization issues, but it is certainly an improvement over previous titles. Even if you don't like what the vanilla game has to offer, there are many dedicated modders out there creating new and free content for you to enjoy, and so are the developers! This is by no means a perfect game, I'm not sure those exist, but it's a damn sight better than what most "AAA" games developers churn out these days. I'm looking at you DICE/EA and Activision.

Review: It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need. Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home. Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try. While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions. The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the "follower" category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings. It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan. While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to "find cover" (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body. Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons. Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface. Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on "Patrol" and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process. After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take. Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience. 8/10

Review: I recommend this game but be warned there are a lot of bad things mainly due to some clunky controls, stiff animations and engine limitations(as well as performance issues online). There's nothing out there like it It's one of a kind really. It's a massively open world military simulator. The scale is huge and this is reflected perfectly in it's online modes and mods created by the modding community. The downside of this is they have one huge map, Altis, and that's all that's really there(No one plays Stratis which is the only other map and it's a lot smaller). So, you're pretty much stuck with the same map, same buildings, same roads, same cities, etc., etc. It would have been nice to have a bit of variety, at least from an official source as opposed to having to download maps from the modding community(Which are mostly maps imported from ARMA 2). This isn't to say that Altis is boring or a badly designed map -- it's quite the opposite! -- but having spent 100+ hours on the same map you do wish for a bit more especially after two years of development(Including Alpha and an expansion/season pass). The scale of the game was really brought to light in one of the first mods created for the game back when it was in Alpha; the co-op game mode Invade & Annex. This mode basically opened up the entire map for deployment from a central base complete with side missions that were entirely up to the players(100 or so) to take out. Missions required teamwork, coordination, squad based compositions, transport management, scouting, air support and heavy and light armour to complete. You would be deployed anywhere on the map with your squad to take on an objective and it was purely simulation based where you followed the chain of command to tackle objectives, requested support and had to wait for air/infantry/armoured support to arrive. There really was nothing like it in any other game and still isn't as far as i'm aware. Mods Speaking of mods this game has a lot of popular mods which, one could rightly assume, may even spawn standalone games of themselves given the huge amount of interest in them and the sheer amount of players who buy ARMA III specifically for some of the mods on offer. To name a few: King of the Hill - Mosh put style game mode where three teams fight for supremacy over an object(Most often entire cities or towns) by having as many players as possible from their team in the objective, killing enemies to lower their presence. Altis Life/ARMA 3 Life - A life RPG where you eat, team up with other players and take on roles in the virtual world of Altis ranging from picking apples, mining, fishing to becoming a rebel, mugger or even joining the police or military to enforce the law and fight off rebels. It's an RP experience so you're forced to act in character to make the mode more immersive(No random killing, you have to engage and have reason to shooting/killing people). Battle Royale - Just like the movie Battle Royale or, for the more modern crowd, it's similar to The Hunger Games. You parachute onto the island, land and try to find weapons and supplies to survive and kill other players. The objective is to be the last man surviving. A zone is marked and it gets smaller as the game progresses. If you're not in the marked area by the time you're given you die. The mods are really entertaining and while some are very simple and add onto the base experience they make the base game that much better although I would question why some mods simply were not developed by Bohemia to begin with and released with the game as standard. Controls and animations Controls are pretty janky. The animations are stiff and can get you killed. It takes a long time to learn all the controls and then even longer to relearn the controls for specific servers that have keys bound to different keys than what other servers have as standard. It's not a bad thing having all these controls as they do make a difference but what's bad is the animations which force you into a full animation loop which is slow, cumbersome and essentially makes you a free kill. For instance, if you want to holster your gun your character will stop. He will then initiate the animation. Put the gun away. Then he will stand up. Only then will you be able to move your character again and you can't interrupt these animations. You can't even run or walk while they're being performed which is simply frustrating and downright bad design. If you're in a firefight and mistakenly take out a pistol instead of your rifle prepare for five seconds -- if you're lucky not to die while this is happening -- of animation hell where you're left with pulling your hair out, screaming at the screen while you're in the middle of the battlefield, standing up and, rather hilariously, carelessly taking your primary from your shoulder with zero s given. Needless to say, the animations are pretty bad in most regards. Animations that can't be interrupted and require you to spend 5seconds performing the most simplest of animations is just bad by any stretch of the imagination. I don't think anyone can defend it and i've never heard anyone try to. Performance issues Performance is a huge setback for this game for the main reason that online performance, the core of the game that people are here for, depends entirely on the server you're on and the scripts it uses. If it's a poor server that doesn't get reset every so often you'll see your frames drop by 50-60%. You could be at 60FPS and then, due to the poor server, you're down to 15-20FPS no matter what computer you have. It's just one of those things you have to accept. You will also experience random freezes and random dips in performance even if you're on a good server. Some freezes can last from 2 seconds to 10 seconds or even longer. This has nothing to do with your computer. It doesn't happen so often that you'll find yourself dying over and over but it happens enough to be notable and strangely enough it doesn't seem to happen in firefights but mostly when you're sitting around doing nothing or just driving on an empty road. It's questionable to say the least. Having said that i'm running the game on close to ultra settings with an FPS of around 30-40 for the most part on a Windows 7 64bit PC, no SSD, 4GB DDR3 RAM, an i5-750 CPU at stock speed(2.67Ghz) and an AMD r9 290 4GB graphics card. There's still slowdowns and performance still largely depends on the server i'm on and what mod it is. In single player my frames will easily double and be consistent with no performance drops. Single player I probably should have started off with single player but I felt a pros over cons is the best way for the flow of this review. The single player isn't great if i'm to be honest. Enemy AI will spot you from a few miles(or km's) away before you even have a chance to see them. You'll be told by the AI leader to target and kill an enemy at X distance or to proceed to location Y only to die because you can't see the three aimbot AI perched three kilometers away on a hill with assault rifles seemingly sniping at you. You'll die a lot and it will only feel like a cheap death. Deaths are just cheap in the SP campaign which is reflected in one of the earlier missions where you enter a minefield and get blown up instantly which is the game's way of saying: "Trial and error, you'll know next time." It's cheap and it's bad design for a game simulation or not. The story itself isn't great either. Conclusion It's worth the money. There's no game out there like it and there's no game that offers as much as ARMA III does in terms of sheer scale and simulation. There's a few negatives to go against the game but ultimately this is definitely something you should have in your game library if you even remotely enjoy shooters or military shooters of any kind.

Review: ArmA 3 is a military simulation game, set in the Greek Islands of Stratis and Altis. This is a futuristic game, using remote control planes, heat-seaking helicopters and amazing new vehicles. In this game you can play as BLUFOR, a teamup of the FIA and NATO troops. You can play as Independent, a group friendly to no one but the AAF. You can join OPFOR, a CSAT controlled team. This is less simulation and more fun. You can make your own scenarios and levels using the Zeus control menu or the level editor. The level editor is simple and fun to use. The modding community is big for this game, and a Steam Workshop is available to install modifications with one click of a button. Installing new helicopters, planes, skins, troopers and more from the workshop! Lots of new gamemodes exist, like Wasteland, Epoch and Altis Life! Wasteland is an amazingly styled gamemode. Complete objectives to gain money and buy new vehicles which come with the game. Pick your weapons and outfits, spending your money. You can fly and drive everything in the game, but you have to pay in-game money. You can join OPFOR or BLUFOR and assist your online team, or play as an independent player, being allowed to kill everyone. Altis Life is a roleplay gamemode for ArmA 3. You can play as a police officer, civilian or thug. Being able to smuggle drugs, steal cars and helicopters and fly around. The police can setup roadblocks, check you for IDs and can do what most police in real-life can. I would recommend this game for anyone and everyone, even if my description hasn't given you much it's a very fun game, easy to follow along and learn. For all of you who have the dream of flying in this game, it's so easy! It includes flight assistance for anyone who can't get the hang of landing and taking off. There are so many different servers, Wasteland being my favourite.

Review: As a reddit gold user, I've waded through dirt and mud (referring to dreaded REPOSTS, haha!) before so I know what to expect from a real life army man simulator. This was not what I was expecting. I was put in to a tight spot with my team, I couldn't even move, let alone adjust my fedora to tip at the lady members of our team! (Just kidding, there were none! Get in the kitchen! Haha!) and I even died once while I was distracted, looking at the funnybanana meme WHICH YES, I DID SAVE. THANKS JOHN! It's a great game, but I don't think I'll be playing it much when I get accepted in to the r/megalounge! Haha! Get me a whiskey on the rocks, autobutler! Haha! - Peter

Review: Game had great introduction and I had fun. I don't know what it says about a war game when the most enjoyable part was the driving bits though... There was also quite lot of lag and frame rate kept jumping. I also had problems with achievements so that they did not come up when I got them, they came hours late or not at all. Game had problems but I still recommend it because it was fun.

Review: Gameplay is perfect, the idea is perfect. But expect low fps ( even on high end pc's ) Some times my gpu load drops below 20% this happens on low to ultra settings. My friends have the same problem. It happens in the city;s. Not in the open. Looks like this game can't be fixed cause the problem ik the engine were the game is build on. The only fix is a entire new engine. Like they are going to do with dayz standalone. I get 75 fps average but drops which are like in the 20's If you can live with fps drops to 25 buy it. The gameplay is the best part of arma 3. The sound is below average. Not the quality but direction of the sound is coming from

Review: First of all, ARMA is not a shooter like COD or BF. The pace, style of gameplay, maps, are really different, but I have to say that it is more enjoyable, funny, and COMMUNICATING with the other players is great. For example, being the gunner of a tank: there are numbers that tell you direction and distance, so other player inside the tank tells you the indications to shoot. You wont be able to find this anywhere else. Or being in a squad, splitting in pairs to clear some buildings while the other 2 players cover you. It is important to make clear that you buy ARMA for its multiplayer and coop mode. If you are looking for campaign game, dont buy this. Also, if you are planning to buy this game, I have to tell you that you will have to join a clan to enjoy this game to its maximum; otherwise, by yourself, you wont like it as much :S Joining a clan means you will have to download MODs (content created by the community), and probably TeamSpeak (program similar to Skype) to play with them (all clans ask for a mic, take that into account). To sum it up, ARMA is a total unique in the experience out in the market regarding FPS. Nonetheless, to have a good time you need to join a clan and play with other people, and be willing to download new content.

Review: Very realistic game. Spot on combat, vehicular, and weapon mechanics. My complaint only complaint can only be related to possible crappy servers I have got on or my own ADD...but either way, sometimes it feels like gameplay can drag on without anything happening for an overwhelmingly extended period of time. Overall, 8/10 in my mind. If you are super into realism in war games, definite 10/10.

Review: ArmA 3 is a good successor to ArmA2 with some great improvements to the engine, visuals, vehicles etc. Mainly I have played the Wasteland, King of the Hill and Epoch (Alpha) mods. King of the Hill being the most rewarding and enjoyable over all. I have only just dipped my toes into the campaign, however I will be doing more of it I think. With all the improvements to ArmA, you'll still get those good ole ArmA moments like clipping through walls/floors, and your vehicle exploding on contact with a weed or bush.

Review: Best game for multiple reasons: The singleplayer is actually good which I did not imagine. The variety of multiplayer servers and game mode is amazing and can do so much, like role playing, taking over an objective and some other stuff. The differences between this and arma 3 is so different, like scuba diving gear and . Anyway, overall, I think you should get this game if you are debating it but you may need a good rig to run it.

Review: This game is very fun and open and alot of things to do. The singleplayer is very amazing with the stunning graphics and visuals. The audio is somewhat clear, but I can understand people clearly in chat and I can hear gunshots and explosions from a long distances and it is very cool. The multiplayer side is amazing and playing from the combat simulation with others to the Altis Life RPG addon and to the epic zombie survival mod of DayZ to surviving and fighting in the world of Wasteland. Last but not least, the editor for Arma 3 is very good, but very advanced to understand right away, just get used to the basic things of editing until you can create large scale battles with the editor. This game is not for the regular FPS players, this game is way more intense in my opinion than Call of Duty or Battlefield. You actually have to plan and use tactics to get the job done and the maps are very large and you can't run forever. So at first it might be irritating for new players, but you will get used to it. Very fun military simulator and it is very addicting. This game is a thumbs up! :D 12/10

Review: I really want to like this game, but I cant. The games mechanics, graphics and the characters competency with his rifle is too far below the average shooter for me to enjoy. I find myself yelling at the game to just hold the gun still enough to shoot and find out where my impacts are. The character can not hold his rifle still, to save his life. Ive seen 90 pound women hold them better than the player's character. He feels totally unsupported, like he is floating in the air, even when laying on the ground. I'm fighting the character's complete lack of ability to hold the rifle still constantly. Any reasonably competent shooter can easily track a target from a prone position without needing to fight the rifle's weight to stay focused. The player never feels grounded. Zeroing feature is kinda cool if it made a difference. Ive shot a lot of rifles, and none of them behave like they should in this game. The game says that when shooting close, I should aim lower to compensate. The reverse is true in real life because of height of the sights over the bore of the barrel. If you imagine and draw out an arc, and you sight your rifle to the highest point on the arc, all other ranges besides the one you are calibrated at should be BELOW the highest point. This is of course excluding the fact that bullets don't travel in perfectly shaped arcs. A round could travel very straight and flat then gravity wins out and will drag the round to the ground very quickly before 200 yards, as is the case with the AK47. A rifle like the M16 will shoot a very flat arc to 300 yards and can even stay predictably flat enough to make accurate shots out to 600 yards without a problem. All of this feels like the game completely ignores or has wrong, so using a weapon system that uses a round I know well makes it difficult and frustrating when the rifle wont do what Im asking it to do. For a simulator that is bad, very bad. The game markets itself as a combat simulator, but I find myself fighting the controls so that much the whole "keep it simple stupid" philosophy of combat training sorta gets lost in having to press 3 buttons at once to make an accurate shot. Let alone assembling a drone and using it with any sort of practical use. I understand they want certain aspects of the game so a player feels like he actually has to do HIS job in whatever unit he is in, because everyone has their own roles to play in the war. However that isn't how the game plays. It would be one thing if the missions were objective based and if you are a drone pilot, your objectives in the campign would be different than say the medic, or support gunner. However your role changes from mission to mission, and sometimes even on the fly. This causes you to pause the game and read the field manual, so you don't crash the helicopter and get yourself killed, while in flight. Or sitting there like an idiot trying to figure out how to put a drone together so you can use it to spot a mortar team on the hillside. That complexity would be fine except if I only get a chance to play this game once a month or so, the the particulars of addressing the problem requires me to look them up again. So when I forget how to "switch to secondary sights on a rifle." It isnt a matter of pressing a button, but looking up which buttons to press in sequence. Hell I could have done that in real life with a simple twitch of the wrist, or adjusting my cheek weld. The game would play out smoother if you were to pick a class of soldier to play at the start of the campaign, and played missions with those roles, so you aren't finding yourself learning how to drive a tank when in the last mission you were on foot doing ground recon calling in air strikes. I get it, one hero wins the war on his own, but once again if you market it as a military simulator, I shoudlnt have to memorize and be profiecent at the entire game just to play the game, and do a complicted task maybe once or twice in the campagn. Pilots can play as pilots, officers can play as officers, and scouts can play as scouts. It also adds replay value playing the same missions from a different perspective, and learning a new job in the game. This game makes my eyes hurt. Im not sure what it is about it, but something about the lighting effects tends to cause me to have to stop and close my eyes for a few moments ever couple of minutes or so. The background blur is so bad I can't scan horizons and look for subtle out of place details of a sniper in the brush. Or look down a street without letting the game's blurry lighting effects to catch up with what Im trying to do, which is hunt the enemy. I thought maybe it was my graphics settings at first. No, its just how the engine is made. I'm not a fan of battlefield 4, but at least the game is clear, and I can predict ranges and bullet drop. Its no wonder Im squinting all the time, holding the gun up is often like looking down the reverse side of a telescope. Everything seems shrunk and distant, then "zooming" down your sights looks how it should have to start with. (especially bad with pistols.) All in all, I feel myself in the mood to play the game, only to find myself yelling at the screen for my guy shooting 15 rounds at a soldier standing upright and facing me presenting a perfect silhouette, and not hitting a damn thing because my rifle is floating in the air. If I survive that encounter I find myself looking up which actions to even look up in the field manual just to turn on FLIR in an APC, because I am now apparently a tank driver at night. Then I explode because the AI has to do none of this. So I go back and play something more satisfying like Xcom, or mechwarrior.

Review: I recommend this game but be warned there are a lot of bad things mainly due to some clunky controls, stiff animations and engine limitations(as well as performance issues online). There's nothing out there like it It's one of a kind really. It's a massively open world military simulator. The scale is huge and this is reflected perfectly in it's online modes and mods created by the modding community. The downside of this is they have one huge map, Altis, and that's all that's really there(No one plays Stratis which is the only other map and it's a lot smaller). So, you're pretty much stuck with the same map, same buildings, same roads, same cities, etc., etc. It would have been nice to have a bit of variety, at least from an official source as opposed to having to download maps from the modding community(Which are mostly maps imported from ARMA 2). This isn't to say that Altis is boring or a badly designed map -- it's quite the opposite! -- but having spent 100+ hours on the same map you do wish for a bit more especially after two years of development(Including Alpha and an expansion/season pass). The scale of the game was really brought to light in one of the first mods created for the game back when it was in Alpha; the co-op game mode Invade & Annex. This mode basically opened up the entire map for deployment from a central base complete with side missions that were entirely up to the players(100 or so) to take out. Missions required teamwork, coordination, squad based compositions, transport management, scouting, air support and heavy and light armour to complete. You would be deployed anywhere on the map with your squad to take on an objective and it was purely simulation based where you followed the chain of command to tackle objectives, requested support and had to wait for air/infantry/armoured support to arrive. There really was nothing like it in any other game and still isn't as far as i'm aware. Mods Speaking of mods this game has a lot of popular mods which, one could rightly assume, may even spawn standalone games of themselves given the huge amount of interest in them and the sheer amount of players who buy ARMA III specifically for some of the mods on offer. To name a few: King of the Hill - Mosh put style game mode where three teams fight for supremacy over an object(Most often entire cities or towns) by having as many players as possible from their team in the objective, killing enemies to lower their presence. Altis Life/ARMA 3 Life - A life RPG where you eat, team up with other players and take on roles in the virtual world of Altis ranging from picking apples, mining, fishing to becoming a rebel, mugger or even joining the police or military to enforce the law and fight off rebels. It's an RP experience so you're forced to act in character to make the mode more immersive(No random killing, you have to engage and have reason to shooting/killing people). Battle Royale - Just like the movie Battle Royale or, for the more modern crowd, it's similar to The Hunger Games. You parachute onto the island, land and try to find weapons and supplies to survive and kill other players. The objective is to be the last man surviving. A zone is marked and it gets smaller as the game progresses. If you're not in the marked area by the time you're given you die. The mods are really entertaining and while some are very simple and add onto the base experience they make the base game that much better although I would question why some mods simply were not developed by Bohemia to begin with and released with the game as standard. Controls and animations Controls are pretty janky. The animations are stiff and can get you killed. It takes a long time to learn all the controls and then even longer to relearn the controls for specific servers that have keys bound to different keys than what other servers have as standard. It's not a bad thing having all these controls as they do make a difference but what's bad is the animations which force you into a full animation loop which is slow, cumbersome and essentially makes you a free kill. For instance, if you want to holster your gun your character will stop. He will then initiate the animation. Put the gun away. Then he will stand up. Only then will you be able to move your character again and you can't interrupt these animations. You can't even run or walk while they're being performed which is simply frustrating and downright bad design. If you're in a firefight and mistakenly take out a pistol instead of your rifle prepare for five seconds -- if you're lucky not to die while this is happening -- of animation hell where you're left with pulling your hair out, screaming at the screen while you're in the middle of the battlefield, standing up and, rather hilariously, carelessly taking your primary from your shoulder with zero s given. Needless to say, the animations are pretty bad in most regards. Animations that can't be interrupted and require you to spend 5seconds performing the most simplest of animations is just bad by any stretch of the imagination. I don't think anyone can defend it and i've never heard anyone try to. Performance issues Performance is a huge setback for this game for the main reason that online performance, the core of the game that people are here for, depends entirely on the server you're on and the scripts it uses. If it's a poor server that doesn't get reset every so often you'll see your frames drop by 50-60%. You could be at 60FPS and then, due to the poor server, you're down to 15-20FPS no matter what computer you have. It's just one of those things you have to accept. You will also experience random freezes and random dips in performance even if you're on a good server. Some freezes can last from 2 seconds to 10 seconds or even longer. This has nothing to do with your computer. It doesn't happen so often that you'll find yourself dying over and over but it happens enough to be notable and strangely enough it doesn't seem to happen in firefights but mostly when you're sitting around doing nothing or just driving on an empty road. It's questionable to say the least. Having said that i'm running the game on close to ultra settings with an FPS of around 30-40 for the most part on a Windows 7 64bit PC, no SSD, 4GB DDR3 RAM, an i5-750 CPU at stock speed(2.67Ghz) and an AMD r9 290 4GB graphics card. There's still slowdowns and performance still largely depends on the server i'm on and what mod it is. In single player my frames will easily double and be consistent with no performance drops. Single player I probably should have started off with single player but I felt a pros over cons is the best way for the flow of this review. The single player isn't great if i'm to be honest. Enemy AI will spot you from a few miles(or km's) away before you even have a chance to see them. You'll be told by the AI leader to target and kill an enemy at X distance or to proceed to location Y only to die because you can't see the three aimbot AI perched three kilometers away on a hill with assault rifles seemingly sniping at you. You'll die a lot and it will only feel like a cheap death. Deaths are just cheap in the SP campaign which is reflected in one of the earlier missions where you enter a minefield and get blown up instantly which is the game's way of saying: "Trial and error, you'll know next time." It's cheap and it's bad design for a game simulation or not. The story itself isn't great either. Conclusion It's worth the money. There's no game out there like it and there's no game that offers as much as ARMA III does in terms of sheer scale and simulation. There's a few negatives to go against the game but ultimately this is definitely something you should have in your game library if you even remotely enjoy shooters or military shooters of any kind.

Review: One of the only game where i spent more time on the graphic settings for optimal 60fps and training in the tutorial than actually playing the game. Aside that the control are smoother than arma 2 and feels more optimized but the content is still lacking. It become a great game if one get invested in it, otherwise pass your way if you expect playing it like a regular FPS with WASD and left click, you'll become a machinist on your keyboard.

And now that Bohemia is adding Karts into the game.. after a "april" joke thing... and then adds it as a Pay DLC... sure the money goes to charity but why need some karts? When are the DLC's that acctualy are usefull... like in Arma 2 where DLC's added more armies and units Czech republic DLC and BRIT DLC? those where good DLC's now we get Sniper DLC Helicopter DLC Kart DLC Like what? But yea... the game is good overall even though the server browser is compleatly empty with servers... and sinse Zeus came out i though there was going to be TONS of servers running it but nah... not a single server is running it... So... use Zeus in SP Editor much better Do i recommend the game? YES 7/10 (No servers and  DLC's that have no use)

Review: This game is Amazing but does have its moments online co-op like getting shot through walls. But this game is well worth the money even though its in alpha its has so much to offer for the engine platform it uses is amazing. the graphics are outstanding for multiplayer. over all I would give the game a 7 out of 10 on Campaign and a 10 out of 10 on Multiplayer just because the Campaign is kinda hard in the beginning of it the Multiplayer you have a good community of players on the coop. I just love it i will keep playing this game until Bohemia Interactive comes out with Arma 4 if they do it will be hard to top this game and the cooperation of other players. they just need to add more stuff but its still in alpha.

Review: I'm not sure wether I should recommend it or not but it's enjoyable so I will. The game was released unfinished. There were close to nothing to do in the game because of the lack of content. There's 2 factions in BLUFOR I think, and one in OPFOR, one in Independent unless I'm mistaken. There's no weapon variation, there's like 2 weapons per faction if even. Only independent have jets and it's just one jet with another variant of it. The lack of content is what completely ruins this game. The combat, however, is very smooth (unless your FPS is on 20 which it usually is unless you have an absolutely extreme gaming computer), well-made and convenient. There's 9 stances you can take, high stand, normal stand, crouching stand, high crouch, normal crouch, low crouch, sitting (while firing), lying down and lying on the side. There's also a combat pace and a running pace which is great. In the combat pace, you run slower with your weapon up so you don't have to walk to fire like you did in ArmA 2. I love the game for it's mechanics which are much, much more smoother than ArmA 2 but I always play ArmA 2 more because of how incredibly much content there is for it. Especially with ACE. The graphics are awesome aswell. The lightning, the textures and effects are amazing but they'll most likely drop your FPS drastically. Not sure if it's due to bad optimization or if it's because the maps are so huge and detailed. Also, Altis, the main map of the game, I've noticed is very popular and everyone talks about how it's 270km2 or something like that, but travelling from one side of the map to the other is only 20km and takes like 2 minutes by chopper which was kind of dissapointing. It's still a great map though with alot of nice places and things to do. To summarize: This game is really well-made and cool but when it comes to content and features, ArmA 2 beats it by far.

Review: The overall experience you get from ARMA games is good. But bugs are to be expected. The game feels like an actual war simulator. One shot can either kill or hurt badly, medkits are must have and the missions are a fun experience. The game is reccomended when you have a couple of friends with you. It gets dull and boring if you are alone (like any other game) but with friends the whole satisfaction is improved.

Review: There's a famous World War I quote that says warfare is "Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme terror." Replace "terror" with "frustration" and this game does, indeed, give you the True Combat experience written on the tin. From the description and tutorial missions, I was expecting a military simulation with experiences like "The commander ordered my squad over the radio to go to grid point 134-190 and hold the bridge, so we mounted up in an APC and fought out way there to hold the line against the enemy advance." Basically, I expected a much deeper and more realistic version of Battlefield -- like the Falcon 3.0 and Gunship 2000 military sims I played when I was a teenager but with infantry and tanks and tactics and whatnot. What I got is... nothing like that. The single-player is more like what I would call a "walking forward simulator." Seriously, my left middle finger started going numb from holding down W while following the squad leader character across a field for 15 minutes while only encountering two enemies. Of course, when I DID encounter enemies I tended to get shot in the head pretty quickly because the AI can see right through the oh-so-realistic scrub brush that covers the landscape whereas all I could see was the tangle of bushes in front of my face with a big red "TARGET" box floating in the middle of them. Then the squad leader guy stepped on a landmine (the only one in the world apparently -- of all the luck!) and I started following some other guys across another field for even longer, only this time with an ambush of several lethal bushes a few minutes out from the save point. After snoozing my way all across the field and then getting killed in the same spot about a dozen times I thought "Okay, maybe the real draw here is the realistic chain-of-command combined arms multiplayer scenarios, let me try that." So, I popped into multiplayer... and didn't see any of that either. There were scads of "RPG" servers where I could play as a random villager, AKA playing Walking Foward Simulator toward the corn field at the edge of town and trying to earn a bit of money to buy food at the market and not starve. True combat gameplay, right? There were "Wasteland" servers where you spawn in the middle of the continent somewhere with nobody around and only a vague suggestion of what you'r supposed to be doing ("fortify a base, gather supplies and hoard them") and of course a half-hour walk to the nearest point of interest. I wandered around the airport for 10 minutes looking for supplies or a vehicle, found nothing, shrugged and disconnected. There were also "King of the Hill" servers which at least featured combat. Well, actually they mostly featured waiting for helicopters to respawn. The objective was to go from my team's base to occupy a town about 1.5 kilometers away, which equated to a half-hour walk, a ten-minute drive (assuming you didn't run over a bush, which would pop your tire and then it's back to the half-hour walk) or a one-minute helicopter ride. So, helicopter was the obvious choice, but those only spawn every few minutes. Half the time some jerk would crash his truck into the helicopter and destroy it so we'd have to wait again. On the occasions I actually got to the airspace over the town, I would jump out of the helicopter, open my parachute, and generally be shot to death while dangling in the air. The one time I parachuted out early and walked for a minute to get to the town, I survived for a good while sneaking into the town but didn't run into any enemies to fight... eventually I got bored of that and ran to a tower to see if I could snipe people from the top, but as soon as I peeked out over the railing I got shot in the head. So, was it realistic? You bet. Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme frustration. Was it fun? Not really. I had a lot more fun playing LUFTRAUSERS while waiting for it to download. Overall a colossal disappointment. I'm so glad it was a "free trial weekend" -- I would have cried tears of rage if I had actually paid for this thing.

From the description and tutorial missions, I was expecting a military simulation with experiences like "The commander ordered my squad over the radio to go to grid point 134-190 and hold the bridge, so we mounted up in an APC and fought out way there to hold the line against the enemy advance." Basically, I expected a much deeper and more realistic version of Battlefield -- like the Falcon 3.0 and Gunship 2000 military sims I played when I was a teenager but with infantry and tanks and tactics and whatnot. What I got is... nothing like that. The single-player is more like what I would call a "walking forward simulator." Seriously, my left middle finger started going numb from holding down W while following the squad leader character across a field for 15 minutes while only encountering two enemies. Of course, when I DID encounter enemies I tended to get shot in the head pretty quickly because the AI can see right through the oh-so-realistic scrub brush that covers the landscape whereas all I could see was the tangle of bushes in front of my face with a big red "TARGET" box floating in the middle of them. Then the squad leader guy stepped on a landmine (the only one in the world apparently -- of all the luck!) and I started following some other guys across another field for even longer, only this time with an ambush of several lethal bushes a few minutes out from the save point. After snoozing my way all across the field and then getting killed in the same spot about a dozen times I thought "Okay, maybe the real draw here is the realistic chain-of-command combined arms multiplayer scenarios, let me try that." So, I popped into multiplayer... and didn't see any of that either. There were scads of "RPG" servers where I could play as a random villager, AKA playing Walking Foward Simulator toward the corn field at the edge of town and trying to earn a bit of money to buy food at the market and not starve. True combat gameplay, right? There were "Wasteland" servers where you spawn in the middle of the continent somewhere with nobody around and only a vague suggestion of what you'r supposed to be doing ("fortify a base, gather supplies and hoard them") and of course a half-hour walk to the nearest point of interest. I wandered around the airport for 10 minutes looking for supplies or a vehicle, found nothing, shrugged and disconnected. There were also "King of the Hill" servers which at least featured combat. Well, actually they mostly featured waiting for helicopters to respawn. The objective was to go from my team's base to occupy a town about 1.5 kilometers away, which equated to a half-hour walk, a ten-minute drive (assuming you didn't run over a bush, which would pop your tire and then it's back to the half-hour walk) or a one-minute helicopter ride. So, helicopter was the obvious choice, but those only spawn every few minutes. Half the time some jerk would crash his truck into the helicopter and destroy it so we'd have to wait again. On the occasions I actually got to the airspace over the town, I would jump out of the helicopter, open my parachute, and generally be shot to death while dangling in the air. The one time I parachuted out early and walked for a minute to get to the town, I survived for a good while sneaking into the town but didn't run into any enemies to fight... eventually I got bored of that and ran to a tower to see if I could snipe people from the top, but as soon as I peeked out over the railing I got shot in the head. So, was it realistic? You bet. Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme frustration. Was it fun? Not really. I had a lot more fun playing LUFTRAUSERS while waiting for it to download. Overall a colossal disappointment. I'm so glad it was a "free trial weekend" -- I would have cried tears of rage if I had actually paid for this thing.

Review: The premier military simulator. This game encompasses so much of what can be done in a video game. I've spent a long time mastering small sections of the game, but the level of content here is an ocean. Want to master the handling of medium range assault rifles? That'll take a very long time to become a proficient master, and even then you need to get used to special conditions (night combat, ranges, recoil of the different rifles). Want to master helicopter flight? Don't even get me started. The flight model is excellent, and mastering just one model is going to take you quite a while. Beyond just the detail in each mechanic is the fun had here. Multiplayer servers are sandboxes and turn the game into a free-roam adventure with open-ended goals. Alternatively, you can join servers where you are part of a cohesive unit fighting against other players or AI.

Review: I would recommend the game as played with friends. Campaign alone for example is ing pain in the . The AI companions are  and enemies seem to be at most points superhumans. I mean they aim ridicilously well and they see even the slightest movement in a bush from one click away. I mean, seriously? Then you drop player alone in the middle of these superhumans. "Fun, eh?" Well yeah, if your ing physics would actually work and the forest and bushes would ACTUALLY COVER SOMETHING. I played OPF series from the start and ARMA series from the start, but this campaign and the AI in it is the absolutely worst. But in the other hand when played with friends (with A LOT OF FRIEDS) it is a good game. Player versus player massive multiplayer matches are fun. Their little ing  campaign is not.

Review: So this one is a weird one. On the one hand this game can be an amazing amount of fun whilst playing several different mods already integrated into the system. It is some of the most tense fun ive had in a strategic FPS. The game also looks pretty dang good, On the other hand this game screams BETA, with bugs a plenty lack of many features that was avilible in arma 2. For example bi-pod integration still hasnt been going in. That alongside the DLC being added even though the game is extremely unpolished. Simply put: arma 3 is great but also a big dissapointment from me. 6.5/10 p.s performance is still a huge problem for many people so make sure you can run it!

Review: I have played this game for around 130 hours now and i just extremely enjoy it. Here are some pros and cons. + In-depth combat + Realistic + Infantry, Ground, Water, and Air combat + A  ton of mods + A  ton of custom missions + All the DLC is basically free. (every new feature will be available for everyone. While you cannot drive certain vehicles, you will be able to ride them as passenger. And when there will be new features like the ability to slingload cargo, you can do it as well without paying for the DLC.) - The game doesnt run that well, even on the highest-end machines you most likely won't get more than around 50 fps. - There arent that much servers, gamemodes like Altis Life seem to have taken over the server list, resulting in a low amount of co-op missions. So expect to bring friends to this if you would like to play missions online. - The game's performance is heavily decided by the server. If the server laggs you will not only get lagg, but a low framerate as well. Here are some final ratings as well: Gameplay / Fun = 9/10 Replayability = 10/10 Performance = 6/10 DLC = 8/10 Servers = 5/10

Review: Arma 3 Is Great!!!! Let me just start by saying are you sick of the troll kiddies running around with the cheapest weapons and using an auto aim assist and killing you right away? I know i am. This game Gives you an immense feel for war and keeps you thinking constantly. Sometimes the Action is spaced out quiet a bit but when the battle hits it is the gaming moments that stay with you forever. Plus Getting that mega kill is something to actually be proud of with your skill and not just stupid luck.

Review: Arma 3... where do I start? Let's start with what Arma "is". Arma is a so-called "MILSIM", which basically means "Military Simulator". Unlike Call of Duty or Battlefield, Arma aims to achieve ultimate realism. Maps are massive, a shot in the chest could mean instant death and a shot in the leg means crawling until a medic takes a look at it. Few games match the level of realism that the Arma franchise has, and while the controls can be strange at times and some of the bugs could make the game hilarious instead of serious, the games are loved by the community behind it. STORY I must admit that I haven't delved too deep into the story, but it consists of a number of chapters, the first being "Survive", the second "Adapt", and the third "Win". I got to somewhere around the middle of "Survive", so please don't listen to me to the fullest regarding the campaign. Anyways, you start the campaign as an american soldier stationed on the island of Stratis, which is the smaller of the two maps in Arma 3 (the larget being Altis). The American forces are just preparing to leave the island when they are attacked by an unknown force. Communications are quickly cut, but you manage to get to your squad and together you complete missions around the island (the missions vary from securing crash sites to attacking hostile bases). IMHO the campaign is awesome, and I do believe that there were some ooh's and aah's exclaimed during some points of it. 8/10, great story but once again do not take my word, check the other reviews for a more detailed account on the storyline! And so we move on to the next part! MULTIPLAYER There are mutiple things you can do in the multiplayer (hah get it? no? sorry :c). Would you like to just kick back and play some relaxing roleplay? Then you can do that! Play as an ordinary citizen or a man of the law hunting some apple-stealing, drug-trafficking criminals around the islands! Or maybe you would really like to hop on and play some Wasteland, where you must gather food and water and watch out for other players. You can also gang up with some friends and build a badass base with walls and mortars and machine guns and a whole bunch of stuff, so you have somewhere to go when you're not out hunting players or completing missions around the islands! Other game modes include Domination (COOP vs AI, join up with a group of players and take on the AI as you battle for complete control over Stratis or Altis), King of the Hill (3 teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent fight each other to control a certain area on one of the islands), Battle Royale (no point in looking for teammates on this one, kill everyone else on the island and claim victory in this intense mod!) and many others. 10/10, amazing multiplayer, great community, one of my best multiplayer experiences ever. GAMEPLAY There are quite a few bugs in the game, however. The ragdolls can sometimes act up and that can be frustrating sometimes, but most of the time it's just funny and they don't exactly ruin the experience. Graphics are top notch, sound is really good (and there are mods that improve them even further!) but the enemy AI can sometimes act like they have no brain. That includes running around in circles when under fire, simply lying down and making no attempt at figuring out where he is taking fire from, but I guess that the AI just thinks that it's so good that it doesn't really need to survive anyways. 7/10, even though the AI is weird at times it certainly does not stop you from having a good time. FINAL VERDICT This review took a whole bunch of my time, and I have probably forgotten what I wrote up at the top, but Arma 3 is overall a great game and is definitely worth it at full price (however I believe that sales are quite common on this game, so keep a look out for that!). Apologies for any grammatical mistakes, English is not my main language. 90/100

Review: Arma 3... where do I start? Let's start with what Arma "is". Arma is a so-called "MILSIM", which basically means "Military Simulator". Unlike Call of Duty or Battlefield, Arma aims to achieve ultimate realism. Maps are massive, a shot in the chest could mean instant death and a shot in the leg means crawling until a medic takes a look at it. Few games match the level of realism that the Arma franchise has, and while the controls can be strange at times and some of the bugs could make the game hilarious instead of serious, the games are loved by the community behind it. STORY I must admit that I haven't delved too deep into the story, but it consists of a number of chapters, the first being "Survive", the second "Adapt", and the third "Win". I got to somewhere around the middle of "Survive", so please don't listen to me to the fullest regarding the campaign. Anyways, you start the campaign as an american soldier stationed on the island of Stratis, which is the smaller of the two maps in Arma 3 (the larget being Altis). The American forces are just preparing to leave the island when they are attacked by an unknown force. Communications are quickly cut, but you manage to get to your squad and together you complete missions around the island (the missions vary from securing crash sites to attacking hostile bases). IMHO the campaign is awesome, and I do believe that there were some ooh's and aah's exclaimed during some points of it. 8/10, great story but once again do not take my word, check the other reviews for a more detailed account on the storyline! And so we move on to the next part! MULTIPLAYER There are mutiple things you can do in the multiplayer (hah get it? no? sorry :c). Would you like to just kick back and play some relaxing roleplay?

Review: The controls in this game are all wonky. You can change them in game, but you can not change views in a vehilcle(there is literaly no button for it). Make sure you have an amazing graphics card if you are going to buy this game. The combat makes you feel like a total noob. When the bullets start flying, your aiming gets all shaky and you cant aim at anything properly.

Review: Whatever you do, be thankful this review is up. It might be realistic and such, but the controls are horrible. You are limited to few weapons, and cannot record gameplay footage without setting the game to view in window screen. Don't waste your time downloading this, as it is 11.2 GB, and there's not alot of things to do.

Review: Bohemias gone to immense effort to create real, immersive environments for Arma 3. Across two sprawling islands youll find all kinds of terrain, from salt-flats to forests to stretches of rocky coastline. Even without a directed experience, just spawning into those maps is a pleasurable experience, letting you explore and discover some amazing virtual places. Arma 3 is also that rare  these days  game that will push all but the most powerful PC hardware. It looks amazing even on older systems, but if you want to crank it up at eye-bleeding resolutions youre going to see performance loss.

Review: One of my favourite Games ever: definitely my favourite shooter, Almost all of my hours have been placed into Wasteland survival and just practising my helo skills - If you are to pick this game up be aware that there is a steep learning curve and practically every key has a function. I've put 100's of hours into many aspects of the game, and i've still only scratched the surface. One thing i'm eagerly anticipating is the arrival of the 2017 mod which is a Dayz esce revamp of the game, focused more so on surviving then Wasteland.

Review: Server browser will constantly break my internet connection forcing me to restart my computer. It's amazing how many bugs still exist in this game that were there over a year ago. Really not much has changed since the last free weekend I was in. I would still reccomend a game like ArmA 2, but not this one. Only on the condition that you buy it now while it is 50% off. This game is worth, at a maximum, $30. So now is the only time to buy it, otherwise you should save your money on something better. If you're going to buy, please don't be dumb enough to buy the DLCs. There are hundreds of mods out there to download for free with waaay more effort put into them than these crap DLCs. Meanwhile they continue to ignore major bugs while adding new content among thousands of already available mods. Bohemia has lost my respect with how they treated this game. I'm sick of these developers relying purely on the community to fix their bugs, and create content that should have been in the release of the game. The core game has a very limited selection. The mods are what make it even worth $30. Also, about 60-75% of servers are a bunch of children roleplaying cops&robbers with each other. It's really sad to see a game with so much sandbox warfare potential to be turned into a playground for kids to act out their immature fantasies. The servers with actual gunplay tend to be filled with trolls and of course, more children. The only real way to play and enjoy this game is by joining an organized clan. Don't expect to enjoy yourself too much in combat gamemodes if you don't have a skilled group of buddies. Having friends to play with just helps the game feel more fun regardless. tl;dr Buy while it's half off, otherwise, stay far far away.

Review: I bought this game day 1 of steam release, it was pretty barebones stuff, a few guns, even less vehicles, 1/3 a campaign. They said more weapons would come, (if you know arma 2, they had dozens of weapons, arma 3 however had less than 10) well more weapons did come, in the form of paid DLC. More vehicles, more paid DLC. Scumbag moves

Review: I have heard many things about this game such as its poorly optimized or it's too laggy. Yes it is poorly optimized in some situations but when it comes to graphics, knowyour computer specs and dont argue when it lags because you bought the game without looking at your computer specs and noticing their bad. In my opinion this game is very fun. It is a very realistic game because crashing a car that your in will hurt you. Getting shot in the head will kill you. When sniping there is bullet drop. I love this game not only for its graphics, but mostly for the gameplay. I will note that I reccomend having friends to play with on the game because it's not so fun alone. Well at least there are some nice people in the game, others willbe totlal douches as a teamate. I love to play gamemodes such as King of the Hill, Wasteland, and Battle Royal but not so much. I will rate this game a 8.25/10 due to the lag even on low setting. Also if you have the settings too low for your computer, the game will lag, I can play this game at 50FPS on ultra settings.

Review: Do you like to spend 30 minutes waiting to get deployed, only to have your helicopter shot down by an enemy jet? How about spending 20 minutes to get the the AO only to realize that your team has already captured it? Do you want to know the feeling of waiting for hours to get into combar, just like real life? If you want real military simulation (including the time it takes to get into combat) then this game is for you.

Review: Dear Diary I have recently been deployed to Altis it is my first tour of duty and already things are completely messed up I watched the Lance Corporal in my company try to fast rope and he ended up going through the roof of the helicopter surprisingly he didn't die until about 5 minutes later when he got ran over by a drunker contractor with severe road rage problems. The second day didn't fair much better the staff sargeant and our driver were shot by snipers who then proceeded to come over and tell us how we "got rekt" right before they stole our truck and our canned beans. Day 3 was even worse we had to walk 20 km back to base because of the theft of our truck which we did find crashed into those sub compacts that can go 300km/h, we lost Simmons that day.....thank god we had ketchup. Day 4 was the worst day we got attacked by the snipers again.I have yet to fire my weapon at an enemy I pass the time by going on 10km heights only to be chased by the drunken contractors again and masturbating freciously, I find myself getting angry at our policies we can't go out into the field with our issued rifles instead we have to give money to the local shopkeep to buy our rifles and ammo his name is Billy he is a nice guy. I still have yet to take somebody down I did fire my pistol at an enemy only to be winged by a sniper's bullet as it killed our company engineer. After the last day of my deployment I am happy to leave Altis we are now heading for another island called Stratis to help with the war effort we will see how everything turns out. Day 153...........all is lost I ate another PFC again 12/10 would get eat again

Review: Great game for anybody sick of the run and gun play style of CoD, Battlefield, and so on. The editor is fun and easy to understand, the multiplayer is a bit laggy, but other than that, perfect. The community in Arma is the best I have seen in any game, and I think you should join it.

Review: If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place. Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Review: My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever. We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my LMG gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. "SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" he died after that. I cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.

Review: This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower. There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive. That is what this game is about.

Review: Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

Review: This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign. Crowd around, children, it's story time. One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying. The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his "clan". I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived. This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport. My new friend was dead. 10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.

If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob the bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.

Review: Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game. Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back. READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.

Review: I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway. Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward. You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance. You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic. The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to. I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.

Review: I was there, and so was he. I saw him through my scope. He wasn't aware of my presence. He turned around, still not seeing me. His eyes were beautiful. I was aware of my orders. I didn't want to. He probably had family, a wife, loving kids... I pressed the trigger. I missed. For the 27'th time. 11/10 best game i played this month.

Review: CS:GO is maybe the best the best game on steam and has had me hooked for hours. I love the way this game can get really competative and gives you that rush of power when you one D that noob in pit! The game has many skins that i think can become some peoples focuses and can cause you to become distracted from the actual game. This game is the best FPS on steam and can get really fun with team mates. When you first get this game you will find the lingo very cofusing and may be raged at by many CS:GO "Pros". CS:GO is a very fun game and is easy to learn the basics but hard to become a master. I am recommending this game to anybody who loves a good shoot out and can! Shout out to - The Orge Lord, 4riy4, Alvero and the biggest bang out of all Ben!

Review: To play this game properly, I highly recommend watching Brandon Buzards Guides on YouTube on how to tweak your PC for higher Performance. Also his video on how to optimize Arma 3 was a huge help. I went from avg. 15-20 FPS to 40-60 FPS. Without these tutorials this game will be hard to enjoy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LwIfcW0EnY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgckg16UC-Y (They are about 2h but its worth it)

Now with the campagin there is much more to do besides creating maps or playing with friends on a server. My favorite is that it has its own workshop !

Review: Terribly optimised, the only half decent thing to play on it is Altis Life, and no matter what you're doing the FPS seems to stick around 20-25. It's not just that, the gun play seems too clunky for a military simulator. When you get past all the FPS issues it's not that bad of a game, but certainly isn't worth 36!

Cant say i can recommend it due to all the performance issues, and i run 2x 970 STRIX in SLI and got a high end Intel CPU, and even with those startup commands it doesnt fix much.

Review: Well... what to say about this game in two words. Its Bad. Arma 3 is terribly optimized for PC. Mine isn't the greatest, but I saw someone who had two 980s try running it, didn't even get over 50 FPS. Never knew you needed a $4,000 computer to even get over 60 FPS. The servers are terrible, there are rarely any servers that are populated with a <150 ping. Even if I try to connect to any of them, it says connection failed. People may have thought I made a bad review because of how difficult and realistic it was. I like games like this. Too bad bohemia interactive didn't put enough effort into making this game run really well, and to make the server connection good. Instead of fixing these problems and making announcements about them, they decide to release DLC after DLC to add onto this broken game. If you are stupid enough to pay $15 for two helicopters, you must not be too wise with your money. I should have mentioned, when getting into a server, you must either donate or go into ts to fly. Why can't they just use game chat? Guess I will never get my pilot license. They probably sould have fixed arma 2 as well, before making this one. I refuse to run this on the LOWEST POSSIBLE settings, because there is no reason I should. A game like this, you need good view distance, and things need to looks some what nice. You can't see an enemy a few thousand meters out, but they sure can see you. Please DO NOT buy this game unless it goes on sale. This game is nowhere near worth $60. I would say its worth 20-30 range.

Review: This game is beyond disappointing. It has so many elements to make it the best... whatever the  it wants to be, but it's too buggy and unoptimized. There really is no excuse for Arma 3 to run this bad at this stage of development. Honestly this game is in alpha, whether it says "full release" or not. There is a huge lack of content compared to the previous Arma. Arma 3 has just about 1/4 of what arma 2 had. The saddest thing overall is the fact that there has been no effort to fix this game in quite sometime. I am fairly certain that Bohemia has the resources, but they refuse to even bother with it. THEY SERIOUSLY USED RESOURCES TO MAKE ING KARTS (a presumably broken waste of money) INSTEAD OF FIXING THEIR  ING GAME.

Review: I think it is a bit over priced but it still is very fun. My Favorate thing is the Editor because you can spawn in anything you like and mess around with everything! Altis life is a really cool mod for arma 3 aswell so you should try that out if you get arma 3.

Review: Do you enjoy 20 Fps? Are you willing to let a 10 year old commmand you like marines? Do you have a top of the line computer? This Game is slower on it Can you deal with constant Freezeing and or Game Breaking crashes? Are you willing to be trolled constantly by your own teamates that end up shooting you? Has your computer ever bottlenecked on low graphics? Are you looking for devs that take weeks to respond to troubleshoot? Are you Ready for PTSD? If you are looking for a game that does all the above daily Try Arma 3!!!

Review: Game is full of technical issues. Game braking issue from day 1 is no support for popular sound hardware in PCs that is: Soundblaster X-FI Titanium Pro (5.1 system) by Creative or Realtek ALC889 (5.1/7.1 system)... you do not hear most of the sounds, and ones that play are rendered in audio scene incorrectly and with issues (f.e. dissapearing volume while crossing center channel or directly in the back, muffled distorted sounds, missing dialogs, effects etc.) The only way to play it right with correct audio is to either channel sound via HDMI AUDIO OUTPUT to your basic TV built-in speakers or buy cheapest Skype USB headset for telemarketing. I am disgusted by the state of sound engine and since it is broken since Alpha stage *according to their forums, reported problem by numerous high-end users throughout 2013 and 2014 with complete ignorance from devs. http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?157247-Surround-sound-problems-DEVs-take-notice/page12 , I spent several hours trying to fix this issue myself with help of feedback from the Internet.

Review: Animations are more responsive, some of the new things introduced are nice, everything else is terrible. For the time being this game remains unplayable for me due to performance issues, lack of content, seemingly uncaring attitudes by the developers and a portion of the fanbase, and general disinterest in the story of this particular campaign. Unless by miracle I find a monster gaming rig behind my house one day and major changes are done to the game and to people's mindsets, I doubt I will return to this game any time soon. Seeing where this game seems to be headed, I doubt any major changes are coming. I'm quite happy with Operation Flashpoint and ArmA 2 in the meantime and for anyone looking for a good mil-sim or just a fun time with your friends, I suggest you buy one of the two aforementioned games instead of this. EDIT: To clarify, I meant Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, the first game of the Operation Flashpoint series, which I believe is now called Armed Assault: Cold War Crisis.

Review: My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever. We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing. I run, my LMG gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across. Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene? The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. "SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" he died after that. I cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.

Review: This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release. One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s. As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower. There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed. As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive. Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive. That is what this game is about.

Review: Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But its even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your  depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Im stuck on one mission that I simply cant seem to complete.) However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves. Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Im sure there are so many others that I havent even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game. In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless. Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

Review: This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign. Crowd around, children, it's story time. One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying. The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his "clan". I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived. This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport. My new friend was dead. 10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.

This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport. My new friend was dead. 10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.

Review: If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get the money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob the bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.

Review: Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game. Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back. READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.

Review: I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway. Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward. You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance. You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic. The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to. I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.

Review: This game is lacking lots of features that other popular RTS games like Call of Duty have and it also has hours of extremely boring gameplay. The helicopters dont even land right either with the engines always exploding I honestly can't stand playing this game for more than 30 minutes especially with how the multiplayer community is filled with little kids who can't even shoot a gun properly.

But 50+ hours of Altis life (mod) has me hooked, not since the early GTA games have I experienced the wonder of an enormous game world. Add the pvp elements from dayz and a thriving community, its the best thing going.

Review: All around excellent game. The campaign was very well put together, the graphics are amazing, the combat very realistic, and the squad movements are very realistic. It does take some time to get used to all the various controls, there are a lot of them, but once you figure it out you can move your squad through any level with ease and destroy everyone along the way. The mod content is getting better everyday! If you like quick PVP then wasteland and the battle royale mods are great for that. Currently they have a "DAYZ" version of Arma3 called Breaking Point that is an independent spin-off that is also quite fun. I personally cannot wait for the Arma3 Epoch (DAYZ) to come out because I have played the Arma2 mods for a while now. There is also Altis Life and Lakeside if you're into the RP scene but that is all preference. Overall, it's a well put together simulator that ex-military, which I am, or civilian with no experience can learn to enjoy and appreciate. --MB

Review: This is a very immersive game, with high attention to detail and a seemingly limitless amout of possibilities. Every peice of your gear is changeable... i mean sh*t you can run around the battlefield in nothing but your underwear and a t-shirt if you so please. You can change your camo and helmet and LBV and backpack and every other thing you carry. Everything that is in your inventory can be dropped or moved from bag to LBV or pants/ shirt pockets(and vice-versa). It provides a very similar experience to hardcore milsim airsoft (if thats what you're into... I am into airsoft) without the "Hey call your hits" or "Hey are you dead" BS. You are even able to create your own missions somewhat easily with the in-game mission editor. Anyway I figured I'd share one of my most memorable experiences in any operation in Arma- or any game out there. I was playing on a mission that I created on Stratis(One of the in game maps). I was leading a 10 man assault on Air Station Mike 26. We were all riding in an APC. My gunner was doing great taking out ground troops, and even took out an Ifrit or two. Out of nowhere an enemy hit the APC we were in, popping all left side tires, stoping it dead in its tracks. I immidiately got out and threw a smoke grenade to either side and told my men to disembark. Unfortunately only 2 men made it out before the APC exploded. In that same explosion the 2 men that had made it out were killed. worried, I threw one more smoke grenade and waited for the smoke plume to build and ran straight back behind a small hill, dodging what seemed like the bullets from 1000 angry hostiles. Once behind the hill I healed my self, and radioed in for a helicopter extraction. I waited and waited until the heli showed up. All I could hear above me were the screams of the miniguns that the 2 door gunners were operating, and the swooping of the rotor. The heli flew right over my head and began to circle around the base, taking out enemy after enemy. I knew the helicopter would not last long, as it was simply a helicopter meant for extraction, and not any sort of combat, so I called in an attack heli for some added assistance. After the attack heli started to engage targets I sprinted inside the base behind a large H-barrier. I could see lots of enemies. I quickly engaged one enemy and started to advance to another H-barrier when I was hit. I quickly went prone and healed up, and threw my last smoke grenade inside the base. After about 10 seconds of letting the smoke build I ran up to a building and began to take out target after target, in some sort of spec ops manner(Yeah I was that good). I ran around the base with the supressive fire of the helicopters and cleared the entire base of any threat. After I called in the evac heli and flew myself back to base because the pilot was killed on landing because my area clearing is garbage. It was quite the experience to get the juices flowing. This game never fails to impress, and I still find myself learning new things about it every day.

Review: Possibly the worst game created so far, even compared to really  indie titles. This game was never optimized for a computer from the look of things. If you run intel anything you'll be fine, but god forbid that you run AMD you'll get 0-20 fps no matter what situation. The developers for this game are autistic  who have clearly never cared for gameplay in anything, sure you can argue "It's a simulator, not a game" but it's still a "Military Simulator". There is no effort for gunplay whatsoever in this torm of a simulator. All the guns feel the same, bullets never connect where they're supposed to, you run around feeling clunky as  shooting nerf guns at nothing. TL;DR Pros: It's a game Cons: It's a really  game Low/nonexistant FPS  gunplay Models are ugly Server list sucks Just about every game out there is better than this , and that's terrible seeing as there's a full dev team that made this. Just take your $60 and spend it elsewhere, that's all there is to it.

Review: Imagine this: You're sprinting. Under heavy fire. Trees look like turds. Sand looks like a solid block of chocolate. Clouds are disabled because your computer can't render them. Oh baby, and those shadows...that you have to turn off because your game will crash. You lay prone and pull out your sidearm. Suddenly! The frames skip. The game lags. You are shot and killed by a sweaty greasy 40 year old man. Your game crashes. You came all over your PC. 11/10 Much Lag Very Death Such Unfair P.S. Still is amazing

Review: A definite upgrade from Arma II, the controls act more like PC controls of the 21st century (not feeling like your wading through pudding when trying to look, strafe, etc.) and the graphics of course are much improved. There have been some issues with PhysX crashes, but only from those with AMD cards in my experience. Sa-Matra wasteland alone is reason enough to pick this up! The only gripe I really have is that they still have not made the client/server multi-threaded. One of the most idiotic things to overlook when the AI calculations and such really make this game/engine heavily CPU-intensive. If you love realistic shooters without all the kill-streak B.S. and handicapping, pick this game up.

Review: This game used to be good but since Bohemia which doesnt listen to people have made this game into a drunk simulator 2014 just as they did with walking simulator aka DayZ standalone. They have taken weapon machanics to next level of unrealistic where your soldier has no muscles to control and hold a gun in his hand since it has unrealistic exaggerated sway in a shape of number 8 and will be adding unrealistic inertia into the fact where when you move your weapon even a bit it starts to rock from side to side. They need to stop changing things that werent broken and fix a million other problems in their game. I do like how they spent a lot of time to imrove some stupid door sounds and yet when you wanna open a door you have one of the worst action menus in the world where you have to scroll your mouse to do anything. On their forums they dont like any negative feedback and only wanna hear all praise on how awesome their unrealistic sway and inertia are. I will be uninstalling this game cause its just unplayable especially since this game cant even give you 30fps online and usually goes down to 20fps or worse and then you realise how horrible the sway becomes. Save your money on a finished game and support developers who actually listen to the customer.

Review: Such a great military simulator you can't turn your head around in a car to look around where are you supposed to go... A Z-category shooter but you still have to use controls like if it would be StarCraft. I don't play an FPS to use my whole keyboard to issue broken commands. Don't buy this game. For a strategy game there's only horribly-done strategy elements, and for an FPS there's horribly done FPS elements in it. For squads and commanders, buy Battlefield or any other non-garbage tactical shooter, this game is just bad.

Review: I hope most if not all of the bugs and issues there are fixed through beta and release. For an alpha it was very impressive but I feel there is still some work to do to make the game the best it can possibly be and with a price of 19.99 ($32.99   24.99) is almost idiotic to pass up. I imagine on full release that price will go to the normal price for a new game on Steam, either 29.99 or 39.99, so get it while its hot.

Review: Arma 3 is a Side-Scrolling 2D Platformer developed by EA. In the games' main mode (competitve), you play as one of two factions; the Terrorists, crazed madmen who seek to destroy the world by unleashing ravenous chickens infected with the Ebola virus, and the Counter Terrorists, who desire to stop the fowl plague. Armed with $800 and their wits, players seek out the various chicken sites and fight over control of the worlds destiny.

Review: For what this game tries to be (Which is a war simulator) it fails misserably at that. The movement is clunky, the A.I Is dumb and overpowered as hell. So if you get into this game being all like "Yeah, this is what war is like, this is realistic and really precise" Then sorry. You need to get out in the real world pall. Because I don't consider a game that when you shoot the enemy in the head they are able to do a 180 turn and shoot you 3 times in the head before dying very realistic. Same goes for boosting of stairs when walking down from them to quickly and breaking your legs. This game is however one of the funniest games I have ever played with friends. The amount of vehicles, the guns, the destructible enviorment. The overall map is not to shabby either. If you get this game for fun gags with friends and just cause overall chaos then this game is perfect for that. If you get it to play it as a serious war game then i'd say the clunky motions and faulty A.I ruins that emediatly

Review: If you enjoyed Codemasters Operation Flashpoint in 2001, then you will absolutely love ARMA III. ARMA III takes place on two different islands: Altis & Stratis. Stratis is 19 square kilometers (7.3 sq. km), with few roads and rugged forested terrian. Altis, on the other hand, is huge at 270 square kilometers (104.2 sq. mi.), with lots of roads and terrian of mostly rolling hills. However, only ~5% of the roads on Altis are paved. There is a lot of detail put in this game, including some indigenous fauna, such as snakes, rabbits, goats, dogs, insects, and a wide variety of fish and other sea critters. They do not do anything but move around, but it adds to the realism. Did I mention snakes? There are a huge number of snakes on Altis. Movement is not restricted. Meaning, you can move anywhere you like. Including using a re-breather to dive off the coast of either island to investigate ship wrecks, just for kicks. There are lots of vehicles to choose from, both civilian and military. Weapons, ammunition, and equipment can be taken from the dead. However, only take what you can carry during the missions. If you put anything in vehicles they will disappear once you return from your required mission or scouting mission. You will only be allowed to keep the items you are actually carrying. The game includes a single-player campaign broken into three episodes: Survive = 8 required missions, plus 6 optional scouting missions Adapt = 9 required missions, plus 8 optional scouting missions. Win = 6 required missions, no optional scouting missions. When you complete the first required mission for each episode, return to base, and told to report in  don't. If you report in, then you will be assigned the next required mission. Instead, go to where a group of your fellow soldiers are standing/sitting, and listen to what they have to say. This is how you get optional missions. Then go off on a scouting patrol to complete the mission, if you so desire. When you have completed your scouting mission(s), then return to base and report in for your next required mission. All the missions, except for the last one, are linear and static. Meaning, nothing you do will change the course of events. Except for the last mission. In the last mission you have to make a decision, and that decision will determine the outcome of the mission. There is a steep learning curve, and that can get a little frustrating at the beginning. If you are new to ARMA III, then I recommend enabling the Save Games in the Game Options settings and save often to help alleviate that frustration. The Survive missions are all solo, so you have time to adapt and learn the controls. The Adapt and Win missions team you up with a fireteam at your command. By the time you complete the campaign (~30 hours) you should be familiar with giving your fireteam commands, both individually and as a group. ARMA III is more than just a First-Person-Shooter, it is a first-person combat simulator. The weight of your equipment is taken into consideration and will effect your movement and endurance. The three different stances (prone, crouching, and standing) will effect how much your weapon recoils, which will effect how quickly you can target an enemy. Standing while trying to hit a moving target at 1,000 meters is not recommended. ARMA III allows user-developed mods, and also includes DLCs. Once you have completed the campaign, and want more single-player or multiplayer campaigns, then I recommend subscribing to the Dynamic Universal War System in the Steam Workshop. The DUWS mod will randomly create new campaigns, with as many missions as you desire. The goal of the campaign is always the same  control of the island. There are still some minor bugs that need to be worked out, but it is very playable as is. I definitely recommend ARMA III.

Review: Don't let the screenshots fool you. You have to have an amazing computer in order to play like that. For most people, trying to play the game on the higher settings will result in more lag than game. Unfortunately on the lower settings the game looks 7 years old. Graphics aside the gameplay is excellent and realistic like it should be. The episodic campaign is the biggest downside. It shows quite a bit of laziness on Bohemia Interactive's part. It's been almost 6 months since the full release and we still don't have the end of the campaign, Also, the campaign isn't very good, but multiplayer makes up for it. I personally love Wasteland and Altis Life. I would recommend purchasing this game primarily for its multiplayer.

Review: Arma 3 is very much an improvement on the previous games and I enjoy the smoother combat and animations than Arma 2s clunky movement but the optimization issues and bugs still remain although not as heavy as Arma 2s. It can be a pain to get into games on public servers where everyone just acts like its your typical arcade shooter or the other side where everyone is being a pain by trying to keep it ultra serious and kicking everyone who doesn't say tango down or whatever every two seconds which is why I recommend finding a good group of people like Shack Tactical to play with. But hey you could just ignore it all and play wasteland or arma life servers and never play anything else which is the great thing about gaming. Anyway hopefully this paints an alright picture in your mind about the game good luck and happy hunting!

Review: Me and a friend were doing a massive co op mode and we decided to take a quad to the objective. Later on about 6 KM away from the objective the quad breaks so we start walking there. We gave up and said "Screw it" and shot eachother / grenaded and my friend was bleeding out so I gave him a medkit. Then we walked more and the objective changed to about 13 KM away and we gave up again so we shot eachother. Now we are both bleeding out on the ground and stranded in the middle of nowhere. Until suddenly a friendly Tank came moments later and patched us both up. Then we are inside the tank and I go afk for some juice. By the time I got back, the tank driver left without giving me nor my friend permission to drive it. So my friend brought up that while I was gone a helicopter was here and a guy offered to take us with him. My friend said "Ok, but lets wait for my friend to get back" (being me) So when I get back my friend gets in the chopper and said "Cmon lets get in" I was wondering where the pilot is so I got out to find him dead underneath the heli. So then me and my friend got out and walked to the nearest air base 2 KM away. halfway there I realised there was a respawn button so me and my friend used it and spawned at the air base to find dead allys everywhere. So we looted them but then the server restarted so we got on gmod. 10/10

Review: You will never play anything like ARMA...period. I bought this along with ARMA 2 Combined Operations. I did so only to play various multiplayer mods (DAYZ, Wasteland, etc) and then just figured since everyone seemed to love the series that I should have the most recent version as well. It's safe to say that I have barely played the multiplayer mods and have spent most of the time playing user created scenarios and the standard campaign. I am thoroughly impressed with how involved this game is in every possible category. Furthermore, I fully understand now how people become addicted to this game. The modding community is the most impressive thing I have ever seen and unlike any other that I have encountered in the PC gaming world. There are some things that any newcomer like myself should know before buyiong this. First off, this game is difficult. It is difficult because it is exactly what it says it is, a tactical military simulator with focus on infantry. Do not expect any aspect of casual FPS. Sure, you may find that in a user created scenario (add-on free missions from the Steam Workshop) but most likely not, as most fans who create those also focus on the true-to-life simulation potential. Coming from Battlefield I figured that this was probably just like BF with a little more tactical realism. Boy was I wrong. But it was a mistake that became welcomed and well received. There is so much to learn in this game that it is almost mind-blowing...it actually only ends up being "mind-bending". The Add-Ons/Mods seem to be endless. Since I am still learning how to properly use them I cant speak on the topic with any authority but only know that they are impressive. Check out the PlaywithSix launcher/mod browser/installer for the Arma series along with armaholic.com and get ready for a new, never ending obsession.

Review: You will never play anything like ARMA...period. I bought this along with ARMA 2 Combined Operations. I did so only to play various multiplayer mods (DAYZ, Wasteland, etc) and then just figured since everyone seemed to love the series that I should have the most recent version as well. It's safe to say that I have barely played the multiplayer mods and have spent most of the time playing user created scenarios and the standard campaign. I am thoroughly impressed with how involved this game is in every possible category. Furthermore, I fully understand now how people become addicted to this game. The modding community is the most impressive thing I have ever seen and unlike any other that I have encountered in the PC gaming world.

Review: I just wanted to play a better improved CTI mode with modern weapons, vehicles, etc. Instead I'm having to buy Go-Kart DLC for 15$.  this game, Arma 2 is better than this game is nearly every way, esepcially with mods.

Review: ARMA 3. a lot of walking, tactical, etc. fun. but the ridiculously mind blowingly stupid AI is so stupid that u wont believe it. do i also need to wipe their rear after they take a dump? it's stupid like hell. when in danger, they cant even run, they'll just act smart (even though they're stupid as hell) and walk "tactically" even though they'll be cut down in no time. these stupid crap cant even take cover properly and stand in the middle of the street. never mind about the cover, they cant even follow the player properly. bloody disgustingly stupid. stupid. stupid. stupid. stupid. as it stands, the AI are just virtual meat shields. i have never completed a mission without all of the STUPID AI dead. and they deserve it for being so mindblowingly and disgustingly stupid. i only wish that the body parts are detachable in ARMA 3, so that i can view their stupid dismembered corpses because they're so bloody disgustingly stupid that make u go WTF all the time. whenever the AI i lead dies, i say "yeah, f u, u deserve it. i hope u burn in virtual hell and i hope it also hurts like hell." leading the AI is worse than babysitting, where the player, being the babysitter, has to resist the temptation of emptying the entire magazine into their stupid faces every single second of the game. i hope somebody makes a mod to turn all the AI on the player's side into clowns. because that is exactly wat they are. --- now that i got that off my chest, time for the actual review. as the story goes, the year is 2035... but the NATO forces still wear the old school camouflage. damn stupid decision not to give everyone pixelated uniforms. also, year 2035, where's the TALOS suit? where're the high tech gadgetry that u'd expect? FLIR goggles? NOPE. everything's the same as the 80s or 90s, except now u have rifles with different names, that's all. the explosives in the game are totally useless against infantry, because there's no chance in hell u'll kill the AI with it. the splash damage is too small, damage is too little, and this is totally stupid because ARMA 3 claims to be a military simulator. i've been to grenade ranges and let me say that the ballistic glass more than 100 metres away is full of marks from the fragmentation of the grenades. wat do u think that'd do to weak flesh and bones? according to ARMA, nothing, or nothing a simple first aid cant fix. oh, and lets not forget that every injury can be patched up and the character returned to normal function after some first aid. HA. and u call this a military simulator? total nonsense. this is also why i want to be able to blow limbs off in ARMA. the injury system is STUPID, just like the AI. well, beside the cool factor of seeing somebody cut into half after getting hit, or become a red smear on the floor after getting run over by a tank, or have his arm hanging by the skin after getting hit, etc. u may say that im being graphic, but let me just say that this is supposed to be a military simulator, and therefore there is absolutely no need for any type of sanitisation. if anything, these are features that were overlooked by developers and needlessly accepted by the ARMA community. anyway, if u want to have fun, play multiplayer (but then there're concerns with cheating). if u want future soldier combat stuff as u'd expect in the year 2035, stay the hell away. if u want to play single player only, forget it. it'll only make your blood boil. if u r into heavy breathing, buy it now. u'll love it, because the player character runs out of breath quickly.

Review: It doesn't work. You have enormous lag on PC's with quad-PC's. The engine uses only 1 core -_- So if you somehow still use a dual-core PC you can play this game. If you have a really new quad-core processor you can play this game too. That aside, the game feels like it's unfinished and just a money grab. They didn't invest in a new engine that actually works, you have no story and it totally depends on mods which still doesn't make it any good. You are thrown on an island with a pistol and there are some vehicles on the island. That's pretty much ArmA 3 in a nutshell.

Review: What exactly improved from Arma II, graphics & thats it! Seame exact  get carried over with some bonusses. Graphic glitches Invisible walls (geometry glitch) AI is AI sees trough foliage, u can't even turn it off anymore Body armor system makes a feel u fight ING T-600s AI aim iscompletely random, it can miss whole clip point blank or insta-kill u from 300m. I can't remember when i managed to insta-kill AI. optimisation sounds scripted events controlls It has mod support tough, but should the mods be needed to fix basic game mechanics one would expect from a simulator? It's not a simulator, it is sanbox game u can mod to make a simulaor.

Review: It's overall not a bad game but for the price I wouldn't recommend it. Pros: * Beautifully detailed world spaces teeming with wildlife * Extremely large maps make for fun and challenging combat as well as virtual site seeing * A nice assortment of weapons and equipment to choose from Cons: * Poor help system and no tutorial for new players - One was later added but it was not super useful * Overly complicated and over numbered controls with a large portion of the keyboard being used as well as the mouse * Poor sound effects; especially for guns * For as detailed as the world and NPCs are, the guns seem to overall be lacking in both function and appearance * Although certainly more realistic than most FPS games, the fatigue system is a little troublesome considering how large the world is and how far you often need to travel from objective to objective without a vehicle. Even walking with an average amount of gear can almost completely stop your progress fairly fast forcing you to stop and rest Overall score from 0 to 10, 10 being the best: 5-6

Review: I recommend playing Dayz first, as the community taught me all the tips and tricks about playing Arma or an Arma based mod. When I first picked up Arma 3, even after staring at the config screen, I was still confused and got stuck repeatedly. With Dayz it kinda progresses you from how to change from first person to third, shooting, then figuring out how far your target is away so you can compensate for it. Arma doesnt really teach you that right away, thats way I was lost. Also, the campaign in arma (what ive played of it) is pretty cool, aswell as the multiplayer, but its big hitter is definetly the mods. Battle Royal, Atlas Life, theyre all great and super fun, as well as the community. I definetly recommend you get this game as there are endless posibilities.

Review: Right from the git-go you are in a virtual reality which is basicly training, you get familiar with the controls and play it a few good 3 or 5 mins Then you get farther in the game and you realize, the entire game is about driving around a basicly endless map that has a few houses and such Pros and Cons Pros Fun multiplayer shooter, even eithout the multiplayer great level design Cons Really terrible graphics it haunts me to this day, like those targets AFTER the vitrtual reality looked like tan pieces of plastic The controls were so sencetive I couldn't go down a simple flight of stairs. My overall rating? 3/10 still better than cod though

Review: I don't know what to say about this game but heres a pancake recipe! Ingredients: 100g plain flour 2 eggs 300ml semi-skimmed milk 1 tbsp sunflower oil or vegetable, plus extra for frying pinch salt Method: 1: Blending in the flour: Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Crack the eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat. 2: Finishing the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally, people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins, to allow the starch in the flour to swell, but theres no need. 3: Getting the right thickness: Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn. 4: Flipping pancakes: Hold the pan handle, ease a fish slice under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.

Review: Do not buy this game untill developers fix this problem! you will be sad a lot... (explaining the reason in following) shortly demostration whom needs visual proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMdzwanxnY for those whom just wants to read: This game's engine is not using your graphics card & cpu properly to give you a good gameplay. even if you have 3000$ gaming rig the best you can get is 20-40fps. If i put every single graphics to very low or disabled(shadow etc.) ... i get 22 fps... If i put everything to ultra settings including AA & renders guess how much i get... ... ... 21FPS! ... ... this game is veeeery badly optimized and engine is failing hard on hardware usage. Developers are not caring about the issue since arma 2 its same problem all around!

Review: Sorry to say but this game is wasted potential at this point. I hate to say it because you can see how much work they put into the maps, and guns, and im not a programmer but it seems like an amazing feat for a company this size, also the. I put 68 hours of gameplay exploring the content, and online, and trying to enjoy the game, and it is very good sometimes, mostly online. So what issues does this game have? Well first the A.I is still subpar, better than arma 2 but still subpar. Many times my entire team has been wiped out by 1-2 guys because they happen to not be facing them and don't react the way they should, OR one squad mate goes to the other side of a wall and gets shot, and no one comes to his aid. I have managed to be successful, but I have to control every single action of my team to prevent them from getting shot, that it takes away any fun from being a squad leader. The other problem was the graphics and UI of this game make it impossible to spot enemies, I know that they are wearing camofluage but the jagged looking foliage and low contrast make it unrealistically difficult to spot who is firing at you. I think that most of the people giving this game good ratings managed to find a good online server, because that is the only time you get competent teammates and the game could definitly be good then. But much like Arma 2, most of my time online was spent waiting to get picked up, or trying to find out where to go. not the devs fault, but it needs to be known for anyone thinking about getting this game. If you have the patience to find good people to play online with, than I could see the game being fun. If you have the patience to do this, and like simulators you could like it, but the issues this game has killed it for me. If they would just fix those 2 things, I would recommend this game, because they are major issues and would need to be overhauled completely.

Review: Arma 3 if you love Modern Warfighting to a new level and loved Arma 2 then most likely you own this if you Don't then what are you waiting for. If you have not played any of the Arma Series pick this one up you are in for a Real Treat!

Review: Bohemia Interactive is doing to ARMA just what EA/Dice does to Battlefield. Content release after content release with no attention given at all to actually 'FIXING THE GAME'.. But I guess that's the sad truth about gaming corporations today..

Review: So along time ago i did a review on this game. But now im older and i understand more about what i said so heres a new one. I love this arma its not as good as cold war or Arma 2 but its still just as much fun. I play this one alot and as im writing this im playing it i do think you should get the game because its alot of fun and has alot of things you can do in it like.... King of the hill, Life, Coop and much much more What i like to do is go in the editor and make mission for myself and my friends and we have alot of fun with that also theres so many mods if you dont like the factions in the game you can just go online and download more.

Review: This game is one of the more realistic games in my library..(probably the only one). While not one of my personal favorites, if a semi-realistic military combat simulator is what your after then it is a must have. If you arent looking for something too realistic there are many public servers that take the game and make it into a new game such as Altis life which basically transforms it into a criminal simulator. Overall it is a fun game if you are looking for what it is designed to be.

Review: first i want to say that this game is amazing and i loved playing during the free weekend. however, i have a major issue. i came onto steam to purchase the game, thinking it was still 50% off, but when i checked it was full price again! after rereading the declaration of the sale and free weekend i realized that it said that the sale ended on Monday, yet there were people saying they bought it on Sunday. this is where i got confused: the free weekend trial for Arma 3 ended on sunday at 10pm. the sale itself ended on monday. i thought that meant i could purchase it half price on monday, but i see that it is full price right now. does this mean that in order to actually buy the game (because you cant do so while it is in your library during ther free weekend) i had to buy it between 10pm and 12pm at night before monday? tell me if im right or i misread the article. PS: sorry if this has to go into a special help section or somethign, because i just couldn't find one. EDIT: of course i found the help section AFTER i posted the question. sorry about that.

Review: If you have the computer to run it prepare to have the best time of your life. I have played Arma 2 since 1 year ago, dayz mod, and other server just make me smile. Memories of executing Russians with Norwegian guys. Running over people with cars and dying from hilarious bugs. Arma 2 was amazing. Later on I got Arma 3, every penny of the 60 bucks it cost this game was worth it. It is so far my favorite game and when you play with others you will create memories that you will never forget. Lets just say Arma 3 is the best game I have ever played, and I've played a lot of games.

Review: If you grew up playing call of duty kind of games, this isn't for you. I can safely say that because I did grow up on playing fps like call of duty, and this game is a little too real. Could never get the aiming right, I must have shot at a guy 100000 times and never killed anyone, huge map, so it takes awhile to even see anyone. But if you want super realisitc, this is for you!

The modding community and player interaction really make this game. Imagine every scripted epic combat scene and now imagine that actually happening, non-scripted and with all real players. Just buy this , trust me.

Review: Was 8/10 without DLC weapons (Because of optimization issues) but since marksman DLC, with DLC weapons hitting 1 hit kills, made the game easier for casuals. Which made Wasteland (Excluding Sa-Matra), King of the Hill, and some Altis Life servers lame. It is currently 6/10, above average because multiplayer is ruined and isn't really fun anymore. But I still recommend the game. Campaign is great, physics is great. :)

Review: -Spent hours in campaign doing scouting missions of no importance. -Carefully select a loadout in cooperative and get heli ride to objective only to get shot down by a bad pilot flying too high. -Used real life tactics with a handful of good players to take out objectives -Spent half an hour crawling around with a Lynx in Wasteland mode to snipe a single guy 900m away and then spent another hour waiting to ambush a group of players with claymores and take all their money. It has plenty of issues and is a niche game but if you like the idea of getting some friends together to conduct ambushes on poor unsuspecting people with half an hour of no combat then you'll like this game. Slow is good in this game. 10/10 would assault a church again.

Review: Arma 3 isn't worth the price. For $10 maybe... But we all know how greedy Bohemia interactive is. The game is so-so even if you have friends who will play it for you. There is only so much you can do on an island with 20+ weapons and a handfull of vehicles. Even the level editor is kind of basic. Optimization is MUCH better than ARMA2 but is still  poor leaving the game looking disgusting no matter how good your rig is. You can get a good hour of fun just screwing around but it'll wear off. Stick with Battlefield Bad Company 2 on steam.

Review: After playing shooters for a while, I have never experienced anything like ARMA. The whole series offers intense gameplay, and I surely could not be the only one to say, after a gun fight, you will be shaking with adrenaline and excitement. If you've played DayZ (Which has the same engine, practically the same game but with zombies) Then you'd know this experience pretty well. I recommend this to anyone!

Review: I can just say this game has no real physics... If you play it enough you will hear the term arma'd meaning you fell off some steps and broke your legs or you crashed into a small bush and your truck blows up... If they put forth the effort for real physics then I would give them a thumbs up.

Review: Mouse scroll Simulator. Want to give orders? Scroll down the menu. Want to get your inventory? Be in a specific area and then scroll down the menu. Want to stop / start the engine? Scroll down the menu. Want to switch guns? Press the scroll wheel twice. Nuff sed, If you love scrolling down the wheel constantly in a 60 Game + DLC " Game " This is for you. Too bad I dont have a job. Wish me luck, * Robs the bank for 60 *

I dont mind any of the other countless bugs in this game but i draw the line when it crashes constantly. How am i supposed to imerse myself when this is constantly happening. I am gonna just stick with arma 2 which is a fantastic game and has already got a better community.This game is more then just a dissapointment, its unplayable.

Review: Arma 3 is the best I've seen in the series. My only really gripe is they didn't get the liscences to actual military equipment and firearms and, as a result, there seems to be a lack of weapon variety. Furthermore, I feel that the factions are too symmetrical in an age of assymetrical warfare. Regardless, you can certainly have some fun with this game especially with the massive editor and STEAM workshop support. Lastly, I challange the developers to implement female characters given the recent advancements in the United States regarding female soldiers serving in combat. Guys, don't fall behind on history.

Review: I joined a Wasteland server (by Sa-Matra) today and here's my story. I spawn in the middle of nowhere. I spawn an ATV and crash. I died. Next, i spawn in a city with 3 people in front of me. I kill all three, a tank rolls up, I blow up from a tank shell. Then, i spawn in another city, with 2 cars right in front of me. two people show up with assault rifles, i shoot both in the face with a pistol and i take their loot. then i see an armored vehicle with a mounted machine gun. I find a heavy machine gun in the vehicle, and another assualt rifle. I repair the vehicle, ride off, and capture a base, which, shortly after, gets raided by 5 people. I jump in the gunner seat, mow the enemies down, and hold off the base until i get sniped by a guy a mile away. I spawn in a town close to the place i just died, i jack a guy's car, and i drive up to my captured base. When i get there, a guy takes me hostage, takes my weapons, strips me of my clothes, takes me into a room, and he instantly gets shot from the same sniper that killed me. I run out naked, take a gun, rush a guy that was in my base, and i get shot in the back from a paratrooper. I then spawn in an airfield, with only a pistol and a medkit. I shoot a guy camping in a building with an assault rifle, i take his gun, i mow down 8 other people. I take a rocket launcher from a guy i just killed, and camp on the roof of a building. I then see a transport helicopter with 10 people inside, i take out my rocket launcher, lock on, slowly... and i let the rocket hit the side of the helicopter. Five seconds later, the whole airfield shakes with the boom, and i walk away like a badass, leaving the wreckage of the helicopter and letting the bodies burn inside the twisted hunk of metal... then i get shot by a fresh spawn with a pistol and one magazine. All of this in just 26 hours of the game. 8/88 -IGN "Needs more guns and 'Splosions' " In all seriousness though, this game is amazing. It definately takes patience to play though, and sometimes, it can turn into running simulator 2015. The map is HUGE, the servers are great, Optimization is absolutely TERRIBLE. and i mean it. My specs are pretty high end, and my rig can barely handle the game on very high at about 30 fps. If you are looking for great fun, play this game. Love the mechanics, love the thirst and hunger mechanics, as well as the gunplay. Not your average call of duty or battlefield shooter. This is Legit. If you have read this review all the way down here, then Just buy it already.

Review: Very bad game. How realistic is to miss 30 times 100m away enemy?? I played damned airsoft where I could hit 50m away opponet with first bullet. When you hit enemy it jumps in air just like in the movies. You are moving with same speed while you are crouchhing or standing. Wtf? Also graphics look ugly and performance is bad. BF4 is bad game but it still better than this. If you want realism go for Insurgency.

I bought this game to play Roleplay servers mainly and battle royale, well I hoped on the RP servers for a bit and just did nothing much but hopped in the back of a guys big truck and we drove it into the ocean it was pretty entertaining and battle royale, I have yet to try it but from videos on youtube it looks just like hunger games on lets say minecraft but way better with guns,cars,etc. Coming over from Garry's Mod roleplay servers to arma roleplay servers and all I can say is, Why didn't I find out about theese awesome servers on arma 3 before. 10/10 AMAZING GAME HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU ENJOY ROLEPLAY OR HUNGER GAMES LIKE EXPERIENCES.

Review: After trying it during the free weekend I can say this is definitely worth buying, I'd get it for myself, but my PC specs don't allow me to play on servers that are highly populated (80+ people). Good community and many different type gamemodes (also the breaking point mod) make it worthwhile.

Review: This game lets you have the freedom and creativity to make/play the battles your way. This is not for the casual gamer nor the gamer who gets easily frustrated - most likely caused by the AI's complete stupidity and the terrible damage models. However, this game is stunning. The lighting, shadows and texture quality really push any PC to the limit. I could go on about the bad points, but it's the good aspects of this game which really sets it apart from the rest. If I had to give it a score out of ten - 8/10.
