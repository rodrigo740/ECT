Corny Kelleher;-;| Update (24/4/14): It has been a fairly significant chunk of time since I wrote this review of Warframe, and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues I originally had. The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind. Multiple new game modes exist, including "Invasion", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission. The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat. The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy. In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new "EVE Online"-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Original Review (25/11/13) A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole. Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character. So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a "community effort" in which everyone can participate. The only "issue" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games "premium" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its "free to play" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds. Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.
Dirty Dwarf;-;It's like a real life girlfriend. Only far less expensive and easier to grind.
happy horadays;-;they should add skateboards for all the grinding you do
HAMMERINYOURFACE;-;Good if you want to waste some time, but a warning : it really depends on it's premium currency.
Lastshado;-;this game is full of color and freedom things like this you dont get in a T.P.S
Crazador;-;I Really Like This
eurobufu;-;This is a greate game wen u are bored and want to shoot somthing
Aetrem;-;A good game, but you have to grind for alot of stuff.
Mite Bejerkenauf;-;You can change the colour of your weapon.
Midnight_Entity;-;This game is amazing for a free to play and the only bug that i have found is that once in excavation the scanner stayed at 100% power and the drill wouldn't spawn, but apart from that and a few clan dojo glitches the game runs really well 10/10.
Stryker;-;Warframe is an amazing game for emphasizing your playstyle, each weapon is suited to a specific playstyle, or adaptive to MAKE it fit your playstyle, this also can be said about the Warframes themselves. Mods further enhance playstyle to the very elements you want to fire out of your gun! While it is a grind, after that first loadout is bought and you have a new melee, primary, and secondary weapon, it becomes a game of using awesome mods and unique effects for each gun to mow down hundreds of enemies in different ways, using abilities let's you master the flow of combat. Another thing great about this game is the animations, while they are triggered by player use on some, which can be a bit sudden, all animations look so smooth, and each weapon even has unique combos, stealth kills, finishers, and so on. I would highly recommend this game to anyone, and it's FTP, but not necessarily PTW, the developers themselves said that everything in the game (besides color packs and Excalibur Prime, the donator frame) is obtainable for free. Grinding to get a new weapon can be fun with friends, and the combat is so satisfying most of the time.
Spectre;-;If you like endless grinding look no further.
Alexander Roth;-;- Story - "They were called Tenno. Warriors of blade and gun: masters of the Warframe armor. Those that survived the old war were left drifting among the ruins. Now they are needed once more. The Grineer, with their vast armies, are spreading throughout the solar system. A call echoes across the stars summoning the Tenno to an ancient place. They summon you. Allow the Lotus to guide you. She has rescued you from your cryostasis chamber and given you a chance to survive. The Grineer will find you; you must be prepared. The Lotus will teach you the ways of the Warframes and the secrets to unlocking their powers. Come Tenno, you must join the war." I think in my opinion is one of the best F2P games I ever played.It has: weapons, space ninjas, Archwing, character costumization, santinels, your very own pet (called Kubrow) and more. The best advice I can give you is: take your time and don't buy everything you see on market.Almost everything you see there can be created/optained through hard wark and patience. I definitely recommend this game to anyone that is looking for this kind of games...That's it, now excusie me, I need to get back and save the humanity.
