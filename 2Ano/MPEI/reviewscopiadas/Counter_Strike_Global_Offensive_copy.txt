Revan The Wounded Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

Coat;-;Dont play at 3 am theres asians and russians
DatSpartan;-;not enough angry russians
SSGSSL Goku;-;Ever wanted a young child make homophobic, racist or general mean comments about your playstyle, this is the game for you
Chupa^;-;When I first saw this game, then I thought that this game is going to suck. Oh how I was wrong. I really enjoy playing this game. I like the fact, that there are some new weapons and that you can purchase skins for all weapons. The new buy menu however is quite unfamiliar, but I guess that's a thing I must get used to. Call me old-fashioned, but in my opinion, 1.6 is still better! ==)
Gotaki #3rd 1 week ban;-;What first started as a Half life mod became one of the most played games on steam...shows how you can really go from nothing to something Pros -Recoil -Balanced maps (well most at least) -Competitive Community -You can run a game even with a crappy computer -With the VAC system, Hackers get what they deserve -Skill is required -Community mods -A special gun for everyone -Footsteps -Strategic in ways such as using flashes and smokes -Easy to play and get into Neutral -Skins, many people will say how skins don't matter and they are 'opinional' but personally who would want to play with default skins, no one would use stock skins so Valve encourages people to 'buy' keys and gamble away their skins in uncasing and bets. I honestly don't know if this is a con or not since Valve does encourage people to put more money into skins than the game itself. Cons -Hackers -Smurfs -People can be salty -Debatable if some guns are OP Overall, the game is a fun game and worth your money although if I recommend it, you will probably get involved the gambling scheme Valve proposed. As most people say to me "Skins are opinion, you don't need them to play the game", well sir, would you enjoy playing the game knowing everyone has better skins than you?
RSn|Animus;-;The best Counter-Strike after Source!
Tabajara;-;Counter-Strike still keeps the award of the best action multi-player game in the world - 1#! Global Offensive proves that and will make you addict in this game. More gamemodes, more weapons, re-designed characters/weapons; and maps totally rebuild in the last Source Engine to bring the best FPS experience ever for you. Highly recommend this CS in your Steam account. 10/10
Els;-;Keys $2.50 case $0.03 = $0.05 garbage since when this game become barbie dreamhouse party -.-
Elizabeth I of England;-;Stop putting me with dirty ing Russians who kill you because 'you gave them the bomb' maybe then I'd be happy.

Chris;-;it was onsale after i buy it 0/100
Dr.GG;-;Yeah yeah, new cs is awesome, super cool etc. But I ing hate that  competitive ban system. I was banned three times for one damn week because of theirs ing "file [GAME]\pak01_001.vpk does not match the server's file" After each 7days ban i was playing for 5-10 days and then they released their ing update. After each update i verified game files twice but it's doesn't help. It just says that your game contain all files, go and get your asspain after our  update. That's total . Man who invented that gay crap with comp.mode go  yourself.  you and your mom's house. You ing . I ing hate you. Why I must  my  after each update to not being kicked because of some kind of . I don't give a flying  about what other s will think about this. This text just make my pain in my  less strong. Thanks.  you cs developers.
