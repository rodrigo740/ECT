Rogue Cheney [Away on Holiday];-;If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob a bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.
Hans;-;i wish i had more time to try this game out altered roleplay is the best community ever tho
Star_Hawk_;-;Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway. "Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm... _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more. _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore. _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds. _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want. _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10 Overall 8.5 Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

Valiantttt;-;Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

Jester;-;Very intuitive for creative minds, if you love to get creative, and if you love the Half Life series, this is the best game for you!
Radray;-;Despite its release date, this is still one of the best games out there, where only your imagination is the limit to what you can do. The base game is sandbox with Half-Life 2 weapons and it supports models from most Source engine games such as Counterstrike Source, Team Fortress 2 and Left for Dead 2. New features aswell as modifying exisiting ones can be done through modding, and the language used in the mods is lua, which is very easy to pick up on and learn.
Player One;-;Garry's Mod is a piece of great game developing , that somehow successes to be really fun and creative at the same time. I have no idea what the developers were thinking when they were making this pile of greatness , because it lacks absolutely nothing and somehow feels so great . 1 0 / 10 Awful ly good . [EDIT] : I've been getting a lot of love 'n' hate with this review. Those people that don't understand why I "hate" GMod but I still recommend it - YOU HAVE TO HOVER OVER THE BLACK AREAS TO SEE THE TEXT. I don't hate GMod. Thx for all the love.
Maximum Player;-;I know I know, this game was released almost 9 years ago, but it's still one of the most played multiplayer games on steam! If you say "nah, it's boring" I would say "hey, did you check out the workshop? There is everything you need."
Midna-Kun;-;Garry's Mod Like Sandbox? Has it! Like Adventure? Has that too! Like Zombie Games? You can spawn as many bloomin' zombies as your heart desires! Like Roll Playing? There are 1000's of Garry's Mod Roll Playing Maps at Workshop just waiting for you to play on! Like Multiplayer? This is where TTT comes from :D Like Modding Your Game? You can do a lot of Modding on here! E.g. Flying Cars, Nuclear Weapons, Call Of Duty and CS:GO Guns! You will not regret buying this game, you can have hours of playtime with your mates or on your own or with complete strangers! This game can really let your mind go wild, you can weld up a new car or make a rollercoaster, much better than Minecraft, and a lot cheaper too! Garry's Mod - 10/10
Rubenzz25;-;Garry's mod...Aah, what can we say about this little gem? This beautiful not-really-a-game-game gives you some of the most open Sandbox software ever. Not only does it give you the power to change physics and spawn gazillion NPCs at the same time, it has spawned a few of the most brilliant gamemodes, such as Trouble In Terrorist Town (TTT) and Prop Hunt. Both are absolutely hilarious, these fairly small items already make it an EPIC piece of software. Then there's Sledding, Gmod Tower and countless others that make it even more amazing. G'mod's a gem, don't even hesitate to get this one!
fifth 'hangover' july;-;i have a few hours
Caesar the second, the vengeful;-;When I got the 1 months achievement, I fell into a short depression. Is this what my life is coming to? Will it last? Am I doing anything with my life? Should I do something? Am I really wasting my life this much? Then I played some more gmod and calmed down.
The Sergeant | FT;-;What can you say about a mod that has about a million servers and infinite replay value with it's own workshop and fanbase? Well, for starters. this game has everything to offer due to its unbelieveable amount of mods and mod authors, you want to blow things up? Go download a c4 charge and plant it in a fully destructable building if your computer can handle it. Want to watch youtube videos in a theatre? Go to a Gmod theatre server. Want to live a life in a game? Go to a RP server. Want to roam around a nuclear wasteland filled with zombies and bandits? Go to a dayz server or another end-of-the-world server. Want to play sherlock holmes and find the traitor among the innocent? Or be said traitor? Find a TTT server. My point is, you want something? there's probably a mod for that. If you have a friend that can play with you on a LAN server or just a private server, get creative in sandbox. you could make something, you could create scenarios, you could pose some ragdolls for some funny or gruesome screenshots, or even just send armies of rebels against two antlion guards. The choice is yours! Overall, this game gets an 8 out of ten from me The mod is the limit in this game, but unless you have friends. The servers can be hostile. (especially the TTT and DarkRP servers, you can get pretty paranoid in TTT ) And singleplayer is only so much fun, you really need to be creative to find fun in singleplayer. I'm a bit on the un-creative side so give the game a try yourself, just make sure to bring a friend.

Rock Yo Taco;-;One day I bought this because it was on sale for about $2.50. I didn't think much of it but then I started playing. I couldn't believe how addicting it was. I started losing sleep and skipping meals. It started to show on my physical health. My family started bugging me about it and even considered putting me into a rehabilitation center. Let's just say they won't be bugging me anymore. But now I dont have the funds to maintain an internet connection. I've sold everything I have just to play. I can't even go to starbucks and use their wifi because I sold my clothes and apparently they dont accept nudity. So basically I'm writing this review from my phone on top of a bridge. My life isn't worth it without this game. Yet it seems to have ruined my life. Goodbye world. **10/10 buy** Great gift for kids! (EDIT March 29, 2014) Your comments make me lol. I might as well make a legit review. Yes I bought this game for only $2.50 but if you ask me, It is so much more worth it. It may not be the most graphical intensive game but I've never had so much fun. It is packed with hundreds of hours of pure laughter and randomness. You never know what you will find in this game. Keep this in mind though, this is a MOD and it is mostly just community made content so it may have it's bugs. But what game doesn't? Only thing I can complain about is the ability of making a joinable server. I never could make one. Oh well, I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone. A true **10/10** game. P.S. you should probably buy CS:S (Counter Strike: Source) while you're at it. Many of the servers require it. Have fun! Build responsibly.
Raven;-;Got killed by soda cans. 10/10 would get killed again.
AIMB.ThePresident;-;INSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR G-MOD  Buy this game for 2,49 on Sale or 10,- on full price.  Install it.  Play some sandbox first.  Try some other gamemodes.  Sees Trouble in Terrorist town.  RDM's everyone and gets banned.  Reads rules on google.  Understands the gamemode.  Play TTT non-stop 9/11 it ok-IGN
AnalDosh;-;if i could only pick one game to play the rest of my life this would be it.
ToastedBacon;-;I think this game is pretty cool, here's some cool events I've encountered over my 700+ hours of playing: - a terrorist lodged an entire nuke at my house and killed everyone - a terrorist executed obama's wife - flew a plane with 3 other passengers into the ground attempting a barrel roll - went on a rollercoaster with a skeleton - jihadded my own undercover agents in a terrorist hideout - ate like 3 cakes in roughly 4 seconds - threw a cupboard at my friend - threw a cupboard at myself - both of us died - rode hoverboards and killed someone with them - played as freddy fazbear being hunted by freddy fazbear - killed my friends with a baby doll - launched a nuke into my friend's plane - ate balls - committed mass drowning - murder 4 people in a tight room - got murdered by 4 people in a tight room - accidentally put a nuke in my plane - destroyed the WTC by accident - got locked in a chamber and drowned - punched a cop in prison - killed a cop in prison - started a mass rebellion against the cops in prison - killed all cops in prison - killed an invisible mutant That's only a few, but hopefully that's enough to convince you to buy this masterpiece.
Rayz;-;The only game where you will have a addon folder on 50GB in a few days.
Spider Man Man Man Man;-;it has chairs.
Nexiu;-;Garry's Mod is one of those games that probably everyone played, and even if you do not, you definitely seen it. So really, you can not even call this creature the game, because it does not have any plot. Actually, this sandbox giving people great opportunities, and it is the players that make the Gmod playable and want to play it.

Shimo;-;Aperture Testing Facility 00171 - Codename: Garry's Mod Welcome to the Aperture Science testing facility known as it's nickname 'Garry's Mod'. This is one of Aperture's most advanced testing grounds, complete with flying objects, weapons, and even movies! Yes, we'll let you watch a movie while we clean the hazard liquid off your portal gun, because testing must go on. Enough of that though, without further ado, let us begin explaining the testing grounds of this facility. Testing Chamber 001 - Sandbox Sandbox is the most basic of these testing chambers. We will monitor you as you explore the environment and well, do whatever you please. We will request you to build objects with a list of items we've given you, and also throw around some of those objects at high velocities to get the full effect of this test. On top of that, we would like you to not only build, but also INVENT... FOR SCIENCE! Invent the best flying machine you can possibly think of! Wait one moment... *Can they invent 'flying machines' with tires?! ...Ok ok sheesh.* YES, THE BEST FLYING MACHINE YOU CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF... AND MORE! PLEASE NOTE: - Multiple zombies and other living organisms may be hurt in the making of this test. - Testing Chamber 002 - Trouble in Terrorist Town In this test chamber, we will be modifying your brain waves so you and many others will have the same thought processes. You will all run around and try to have normal social interaction.The twist to this test is every once in awhile your brain waves will have slight fluctuations, changing your thought process. Maybe you'll be a bloodthirsty killer, or a detective?! WHO KNOWS?! Don't worry, no harm will come with this test... it's just a test! Maybe even a trust test... Testing Chamber 003 - Prop Hunt For this next test, you will be trying one of Aperture's new inventions, The Hand-Held Possession Gun. It may sound alot like the Portal gun, but rest assured it is much different! We will fill the test facility with items and trash such as cans, papers, old buckets, a book, etc. etc. etc. As the test subject, you will use your Possession Gun to take over these items and hide. Hide, you ask? We will be searching for you in the name of... Science. We must see how sell the gun works after all! Don't worry if you wear screams and spontaneous explosions! It's for the name of SCIENCE! Testing Chamber 004 - Death Run Just like our previous test facilities, this test chamber you must find your way to the other side to continue into the next chamber. However, you must run for your life! We will have many of Aperture's best inventions in this test, maybe even throw in some propulsion gel for extra speed, since you're running for your life and all. Watch out for those traps GLaDOS set up, actually in this test chamber, GLaDOS likes to be called death. Testing Chamber 005 - Cinema This is the final test chamber we will be explaining, don't want to give out to many spoilers! Here we will use our fluorescent calcium to monitor neuronal activity... and while we do so you can sit with your friends and watch some movies, on the house! We even have popcorn included, oh wait... popcorn acts up with the fluorescent calcium. Maybe you should skip the popcorn today... ANYWAYS! Those are the only test chambers we will be explaining today. Don't worry, there are at least 29 more chambers to check out! Wait... this just in... *What? THESE AREN'T CHAMBERS? ... THESE ARE GAMEMODES ON A VIDEO GAME? No... that's okay. We can still use this for testing... FOR SCIENCE!* It's okay everyone! We will now be playing a video game today, Garry's Mod! It has many gamemodes and will definitely help your brain and benefit science! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FINAL VERDICT: Garry's Mod is a very fun game that is one of my favorites. It has many gamemodes (I've counted 29!) and because of that, it never gets old. It also has very nice workshop items, and some of those many workshop items include Portal, so you really can have your very own testing chambers! As I said, there is a very wide variety of things to do in this game, with all of its gamemodes and workshop items. The only complaint I have about Garry's Mod is some of the community members can be really big jerks, but there is also really nice people so I don't judge it on that. I give Garry's Mod 9/10 bagels, and if you don't like bagels, make it tacos. Yes... 9/10!
Half-Eaten Tuna Sandwich;-;10/10 Almost the same pleasure of fapping.
YoloSapiens;-;Garry's Mod is not a game. Garry's Mod is all games you can imagine of. Endless hours of fun, even more fun when you play with friends. Garry's Mod is love, Garry's Mod is life.

KING;-;IT'S LIKE PLAYING WITH THAT PIECE OF PAPER SPONGEBOB GOT FROM SQUIDWARD
HonestPanda;-;Killed a man with a watermelon 10/10
ZinK;-;I recommend this game because I am a ball
Ember;-;Freedom, that's all I can say. A way to escape life and just, do whatever the f**k you want. Roleplaying if you wanna get away from your real life, sandbox for random sh*ts and giggles, TTT for those sneaky kind of people, and just, you can do anything. Amazing sandbox game.
Anubis;-;This is Garry's Mod, a video game developed towards those with a creative edge. You are able to use a wide variety of tools to construct intricate structures with which you can kill other people for 'lulz.' If building isn't your thing, you can join screaming children and their feeble attempts to carry out a decent roleplay on the DarkRP servers. If getting stomped by minges such as myself isn't for you either, you can always try Singleplayer. Overall, I recommend this game as a result of its unique abstraction. However (queue adhominem), Garry Newman is one of the least intelligent game developers I have ever come to know of (the least intelligent of all time being PHIL_FISH.) On top of this, facepunch.com (the game's website) is run almost entirely by tea drinking monkeys each wearing a tuxedo and holding a glass of fine '67 Chateau Latour. It is indeed possible to get banned for absolutely anything, but here is a short list of my favourite reasons. - Using internet memes - Inquiring as to why another user has been banned - Posting a joke. If you do buy Garry's Mod, do not sign up to Facepunch.
Metacore;-;It's pretty good.
Chargeback Thomas;-;Garry's Mod is a sandbox game. You have a wide variety of props from various Source games (depending on which you own), and multiple tools at your disposal. With these, you can build different contraptions, make vehicles, construct buildings, etc. As well as all the content included in the game, you can find a ton of mods online via the game's website or Steam Workshop. You can also make/script your own. But the fun doesn't stop there. Multiplayer is a totally different thing entirely. You can find sandbox servers and build with up to hundreds of other players, or you could dive into one of the many user created game modes. From Hide and Seek to Role Playing, there is a huge variety of unique modes to play. A few I would recommend are: Trouble in Terrorist Town. A group of 'innocent' terrorists must work with the detective(s) to discover who the traitors are and kill them. The traitors must take out the innocents, preferably without alerting anyone else. No one knows who is innocent and who is not, making for a sometimes tense experience. Morbus. A group of humans must hold out for a certain amount of time against aliens, or kill them all. There are two types of aliens: Brood aliens, and Swarm aliens. The Brood aliens get upgrades, and can transform into humans. Allowing them to get into groups and pick off people one by one. The Swarm aliens are what players spawn as when they die (assuming they were killed by another Swarm alien, or human). These have a melee and ranged attack, but no upgrades. Their role is to weaken the humans, and try to kill them. The humans have needs. Every now and then you will have to either sleep, eat, shower, or pee. You cannot move during this time, so must be wary of those around you, in case they are brood aliens. Overall one of the best game modes. A ton of fun, especially with friends. DarkRP. DarkRP is one of the more casual RP modes in Gmod. You spawn into the map as a citizen, and can choose a job to play as. From drug dealers to civil protection, there is a wide variety of roles to pick. You can go around earning money, commit crimes, buy and furnish your own house, etc. Great if you find the more serious RP servers to be boring. If you plan to buy the game, be sure you own Counter-Strike: Source too. A lot of maps use textures from CS:S, and if you do not own it you will see purple and black squares everywhere. I spent about 350 hours experiencing this, and I would not recommend it. Overall the game is absolutely brilliant. One of the very few that I can keep going back to and not get bored. I purchased the game around 4 years ago for 5.99, and have since put almost 600 hours into it. One of the best purchases I have ever made.
Fyrelex;-;You can spawn watermelons ;)
Grimshaw;-;Thanks to this "game", I have pictures of: Lara Croft kicking Nick from L4D2 in the face, Chuck Norris attacking a helicopter with a grenade in each hand, Gimli, Son of Gloin sneaking up on an unawares Balrog, Alex from Half Life 2 cursing the heavens due to two handfuls of broken fingers. 10 out of 10.

gespeechitz's meatball;-;its alright
Nunu36 | Main;-;Garry's mod. Where to start - With a decent amount of hours in this game I can say I am able to write a fair review. - When some people see garry's mod they only think about the sand box aspect of the game and nothing else. Well they do not know garry's mod. Garry's mod has 100's of amazingly built gamemodes into one game. Yeah sure sandbox is fun and it's a great starting point for a newbie to Garry's mod but there is just so much more to offer - GAMEMODES - SANDBOX - Sandbox is great. You get to build whatever you want and upload it so people all across the globe can use it. It gets a bit repetitive over time, I just wish they added more tools such as precision and stacker to it without having to download a whole entire mod. But mods. Oh that changes sandbox. You can be spiderman in a Delorean that travels through time (From BTTF) whilst running over a bunch of Halo Elites and your friend trying to gun you down with a epic sax guy saxaphone that explodes anything in sight. - TROUBLE IN TERRORIST TOWN - Trouble in terrorist town is a great gamemode that is fan made. I have not played much TTT but the parts I have it was really fun. Yeah it's fun playing online with random people at times besides when people scream " RDM " " HOWD YOU KNOW I WAS A TERRORIST?! ?! " " BANNED BY OPERATOR ". Playing with a bunch of friends can be a blast, all join a Teamspeak server or a giant Skype call and you will have a bunch of fun. - JAILBREAK - Jailbreak.. Where do I start... Jailbreak is basically a gamemode where a bunch of prisoners have to either listen and do what the gaurds say and play a bunch of "FUN" games to be the last prisoner alive. Or you can be a sneaky prisoner and rebell, you could sneak out of your cell and sneak into the armory where all the guns are kept, then you start a REVOLUTION to kill all the gaurds and win the round. Jailbreak does get a bit sketchy when you join a server and people arent playing right, or there is always that gaurd that runs around killing all the prisoners (RDM), Random death match) and people saying " recorded " " getting admin " But when it's played right it's a blast. - DARK RP - Oh god. I have played a bunch of RP and it really depends on the server, You get to choose your job, you can buy a house and do whatever you want. My friend and I made a drug empire and became loaded, we got every car and it was just fun. Then we had enough of that so we made a gang called The Bloods to fight against our rivals the Crips. We recruited a bunch of people and had a gang war and to be honest, it was one of my greatest times in Garry's mod. Dark RP is a pain when you have to explain your self to an admin every two seconds on how you didnt RDM this citizen or how you didnt mean to go back to the place you died, but if it runs smooth it is just fun. - - I hope you enjoyed this reveiw, it took about 20 minutes to think up and write so it would be appreaciated if you thumbs up this review :) thankkkkkks <3 - My rate - 9.5/10
Sir_Crumpets;-;Smacked and killed a cop/admin with a car door. Got banned after screaming "All hail our lord and savior, the mighty car door!" in all chat. 21/10 would play 9 + 10 times again.
Qualex;-;Amazing game, but remember, it's only as good as the addons you put into it. The very basic singleplayer itself is fun, but lacking in parts as a sandbox game. However, this can be fixed by a quick visit to the workshop, where you will be able to find virtually any addon you wish. Do you want to parachute out of a Black Hawk while quickscoping Osama bin Laden in the head? You can do that. Do you want to nuke a base made completely out of couches, during a slow mo sequence? That is also possible. There are also many multiplayer servers, ranging from sandbox, to Roleplay, to TDM, or to Trouble in Terrorist Town. Virtually every sort of multiplayer experience possible is in this game. The multiplayer games have themes like Zombie survival, or military life, and arcade deathmatch. However, it should also be noted, there are MANY bugs. While these bugs are virtually non existant in vanilla singleplayer, you WILL encounter them once you download some addons. Having many addons will slow down the game load speed, if you're on a low-end computer. 9/10.
edLaika @Estonia;-;If you don't have this game I feel sorry for you!
Kawaii-Succubus;-;A great co-op or solo game full of interesting game modes such as sandbox, trouble in terriost town and more other game modes. Its a interesting game with good workshop items and fun gameplays. Greatness is within this game, a excellent freeroam or gamemode game.

Mr.Bonzi;-;The "game" known as "Garry's Mod", is not a game, it is actually a highly effective time travel program which was secretly stolen from the U.S government by the infamous hacker Garry Newman. The exact purpose of the game is uknown but most agree that by running the program you will be teleported anywhere from 2 hours to 3 days into the future. Because the program, which is known as "Garry's Mod" was stolen while it was still unfinished: Leading to the biggest problem in the program: It may randomly crash at any moment. The U.S secretely gave Garry amnesty for his crime in return for not telling VALVe that they had not reimbursed them for using the Source engine in the development of the project. I advise you to avoid Garry's Mod entirely because playing it often results in these side effects: Withdrawl after play, Major Obsession, Self-Neglect, Self-Mutilation (typically when the game crashes), Emotianally Distant, and sever Cravings. Do not let what happened to me happen to you. Do not play this game.
Buying gf;-;A 8 year old admin permabanned me for stealing his drugs from his house as a Hobo in DarkRP. 9/11 - Would steal again.
() Ayano Sugiura;-;In this game you run around doing whatever you want. it gets really fun in mulitplayer when you can go around spawning stuff and running over people's builds with a school bus.
Conor;-;It's Gmod, how much more do I need to say? Every single PC gamer, everyone on Steam knows what it is already and knows how fun it is. It's IMPORTANT that you buy Counter Strike: Source with this game because this game uses it's textures and without it, everything looks ugly pink and black. An amazing game if you want fun multiplayer in amazing gamemodes in great maps. Download the mods from the workshop and the gamemodes/maps and you'll have an amazing Multiplayer game that you will spend hours with. Also, remember when you get this game to play Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) , it's amazing fun. If you haven't heard of it, which I seriously doubt, basicalul there are Traitors and the rest are Innocent Traitors (Also Detectives), Traitors try to kill, everyone else tries to stop/kill them. Everything else it's best to figure out on your own. Every PC Gamer should own this, I give it a rating of 10/10 , the Multiplayer section of this game is Massively Populated and you just can't afford to miss this out in your life.

Xaphoon;-;Are you not sure about buying Garry's Mod? Ask yourself these questions. 1. Do you like playing with people ages 6-12 on every server? 2. Do you like constantly having DDoS Threats from 9 year olds with booters? 3. Do you like having constant fun on a game that never gets old? 4. Want to waste your life? I do too!! Buy it, best game ever, with over 1,500 hours so far. I'd rate this my favourite game.
WEEDWEEDWEED;-;People talk... they say that ten years of progress has been ruined by little kids who watch gay YouTube videos by so-called "partners" and "Internet celebrities" who only play DarkRP and shit up the vast mountains of custom content with FNAF saves and brain-numbing "sexy" dupes. They are wrong, this has actually improved the game's multiplayer experience vastly... do you know how fucking hilarious it is to tell a kid they can unlock all of the achievements by telling them to enter "unbindall" followed by "bind x +voicerecord" and then hearing them rage on the mic, quitting the game and then never returning them because you cyberbullied them? My friends, this is the greatest game ever made.
Snipercakeman;-;A world with your creativity at your disposal. The game is one of the greatest open sandbox games probably in history, and I say that cus it's inspired so much creativity, both through the youtube gmod community (which I am part of) and through the world of artwork and just general fun and gaming. However I say this based on what gmod has always been, now however there are times it barely even works, thats thanks to the dreaded "13" update. It's getting back on its tracks though and can still be used rather well for what ever your purpose or desire. Worth the buy and worth the time, hours of fun with this beauty.
Sir Useless;-;It's a mod. Made by a man named Garry. Garry was no ordinary man. He made a mod. That mod was called Garry's Mod. You see? Pretty clever right? Since this game is in fact a mod, and that mod is made by Garry, he named it Garry's Mod. Garry's Mod is therefor obviously made by a man named Garry. But what if this game called Garry's Mod is not in fact made by a man named Garry?! Then what would that mean??! That he is a man who likes to lie about his name? Or perhaps he just wants to conceil his identity? That might be the answer. Identity theft is a common thing you know. If that is his reasoning behind calling Garry's Mod then that is indeed pretty clever. You can never be too careful these days. It's like that time when Garry bought a teddy bear, which he wouldn't confess was meant for himself and said that it was a gift for his niece in Spain. Although he thought to himself that it was a pretty clever lie, it really wasn't. You're most likely asking yourself, how did we end up in this situation? Well young man, that answer is not one you'll be hearing about any time soon. See you next year.
Shintaro Kisaragi [];-;This game is great for playing with your friends and just messing around in general.
HONOF;-;Riding a Barthub into the depths of doom? Making "he-mans" head as big as planet earth? No worries garry's mod offers you all of these options!
[WOW]Zachy[WOW](Lida_);-;Honestly probably the game that got me into most of what I like to do. Computers, Pc gaming, just almost anything. Without this I probably wouldn't be a PC player at all. The game is overall perfect, you can do basically anything you want within the source engines limits (and that of your computers hardware) and has a very strong player base. Anything from hide and seek, to Role playing in a deserted world. This game more or less has it all. With mods a plenty, customizing what your character looks like from almost any game, movie, tv show ect (as long as you or someone modeled it). Its great fun with friends and just random people. Overall if you haven't even touched this game or tried it, I HIGHLY recommend you get it, because its jack of all trades game, and it may help you discover yourself. overall 11/10
LatvianTanker;-;Great game! Best game for building,love it
King Daro;-;I use to have a life before Gmod,luckily that issue has been solved. Gmod all day,Gmod all night.

Brightfruit;-;Booted up the game and broke my pelvis, 8/8 would br8 again.
UnforgivenCaleb;-;After hundreds of hours (and screenshots) in GMod, I think it's time I gave this a more proper review. This is a sandbox game in which anything goes. Want to make a vehicle covered in guns? You can do that. Want to make a goofy screenshot (or screenshots)? You can do that. Want to mow down scientists with an AK-47? You can do that. Want to use hundreds of add-ons that add lots of weapons, ragdolls, tools, etc.? You can do that. Want to sit down and watch a YouTube video in a movie theater (with the right maps and add-ons)? You can do that. Want to pose Kevin Spacey? You can do that. Want to play on a roleplay server and get banned for killing people? You can do that. Want to go to the forums and see a lot of people complaining about FNAF? You could do that... but I would avoid that. Bottom line: If you want a game where you can just do whatever you want, this is the game for you.
Kyroth;-;It's okay. I've only played a few hours but I'll reccomend it.
Loker;-;Dozens of awesome multiplayer modes like TTT, Murder, and DarkRP  Endless things to do in the sandbox  Workshop filled with addons to download at the click of a button  Will keep you playing for hours and hours until you realize you've been sitting at the computer for two weeks non-stop
TheGort (HenatiKun);-;If you love these things: - ing around with your friends - Literally nuking everyone every 2 seconds - Being a tiny  prop and  people off while doing so - RDMing people for no particular reason - Making dolla' dolla' bills yo - Meeting 12 year olds on every ing server you join - Being a troll - Having no idea what the  you're doing - Having fun Then I totally recommend you get this game right now.
Grodor;-;If you like kids getting  and start to cry when they get rdm'd on ttt or DarkRp this game is for you. Also try jailbreak if u want little kids telling u to bend down so they can  u in the .

Zeus;-;Garry's Mod Garry's Mod isn't a game for everyone, some will like it and other will hate it but in the end you need to accept it, not everyone has the same taste in games. I'm here to talk a little bit about the downside aswel so I will start with that. Maybe a downside/dislike about the game would be that I heared a couple of friends saying they don't like Gmod, I asked them why and they all replied with this sentence: "I watched a YouTube video of gmod(ttt) on SeaNanners his gaming channel and it seems so fun playing with your friends, but I don't have a group of friends like that". That keeps you thinking what is the downside of this game and the answer is in the sentence before: the word "friends". Not everyone starts playing Gmod with friends most of the people that start playing Gmod had totally no friends that's also not a bad way because I started that way and it all worked out for me. Some of those people that liked the game chose a random server in the server's list and then they go after a couple tries into a good server but some of the others were less fortunate and they went to bad servers with annoying and hatefull people. My point here is if you find a server that is worth playing on and make good friends then you will have hours playing the game. Why you should like the game is because of the many awesome addons, also the people on it are very nice(the most). You will never get bored if you have nice people around you so that's the first thing you need to do find a good server with awesome people that are always on the server and also don't forget to check if the staff of that server helps you out is friendly etc.. The many gamemodes are def a like on this game you have TTT, Murder, PropHunt and many more. Trouble In Terrorist Town- In this gamemode, you are all terrorists, however hidden amoungst you are one or more traitors. Kill the traitors before they kill you! Murder - In this gamemode, there is a murderer amongst you. But like TTT, you don't know who to trust or who to kill. Prop Hunt - In this gamemode, you can take control of either the Hunters or the Props, and try to see who can survive the longest. If you're a Prop, try to not get caught by the Hunters, who are out to get you! Advise: you just need to buy it and you will see that i'm right, Gmod is an awesome game (even if it isn't a real game but a sandbox of many gamemodes) and you will make tons of new friends, friends that will stay on your side. 14/12/13 (My first good server with nice friends). Special thanks to Daniel who is one of those friends. I hoped this helps you a little bit of making your choice. Zeus
Keyser Sze;-;Killed someone with a bathtub and then got banned from the server. 10/10
ECTM. Codrinel;-;Great game to play in a rainy day.. or a snowy day. Or anyday anytime.
Gypsyy;-;Played some TTT got screamed at by a 5 year old #IamNowDeaf Played DarkRP got banned straight away. Played some DarkRP raided an admin base got banned. Played some more TTT and got killed by a 5 year old and instead I yelled at him Made a friend went and RDMed on darkrp got screamed at by a 6 year old not a 5 year old a 6 year old!!! Got banned THE END OF MY REVIEW THANKS EVERYONE (except that faking 5 year old he can go fak himself)
xDragonFall;-;Really fun game you can mostly do anything you imagine and the workshop makes it 10 times better!
memefeast420;-;this game took my virginity
CyborgParrot;-;This was great before the FNAF Fantards took over...
The Derper;-;I really like this game. Like, a lot. I mean, seriously. I have 3000+ hours in it. I really, REALLY like this game. The reason why I don't recommend it is because of the community. If you like playing public multiplayer, don't bother. 90% of the community is made up of kids from the age of 5-14. Not even joking. It's rare to find a 15+ year old on this game, and even more rare to find a mature one. You could always play singleplayer, but the problem is that singleplayer gets boring quite quickly. Actually, it's pretty hard to find someone who is truely mature in this game and doesn't have anger issues or has a voice which can break a wine glass. Of course, if you don't mind little kiddies, or you are one yourself, go right ahead and buy this game. I'm sure you'll have fun with it, I know I did. But if you want a mature, respectable community? Don't bother. If the community was better, I would totally recommend this game.
~FAZ3_SQUIGLY~;-;It's good
Pod;-;Feel like a bit of a kid playing this sometimes but damn it's so much fun. A community made game with infinite free DLC. You can't go wrong.
Afghan Eggplant;-;I can play with ragdolls even more intense than I played with dolls during childhood. 10/10

ared ny;-;The best screw-around game of the generation.
John Spaztic;-;Ooh, what does THAT do? - Curiosity Core, Portal 2 THE GOOD There are so many gamemodes and way to play the you won't be bored in the gamemode department. The problem with this however, is that if you have a favourite gamemode that isn't Trboule in Terrorist Town/TTT (Murder mystery), DarkRP (Roleplay) or Sandbox (Sandbox) then the best of luck finding a local server. Also, with the 198,000+ items in the workshop to date, it makes it the second biggest workshop on Steam. If you're looking for a particular thing, such as charcter models/skins, then you have to sift through a lot of rubbish to find what you want. THE GREAT The Gmod community is huge, approaching the likes of L4D2, Portal 2, or even getting to the stage of Team Fortress 2 (At least if it weren't FtP). This means new servers, new addons, new workshop creations, all new each day. It is never the same game twice, unless you choose it to be of course. It is possible to mount games on Gmod, so long as they run on the Source engine. Even so, this means your content from The Half Life games (Source), Portal and L4D series, Team Fortress 2 and many other games are all able to be mounted from the word go. And, arguably the best thing about Gmod, is the fact that you can do ANYTHING. Not like most 'realistic' first person shooters which say "Hop on your bike. You can go anywhere you like! (So long as it's in this general direction.)" No. If you can think of it, then it can be made. And yes, there are some pretty crazy things out there, but that makes it all the more fun. THE UGLY If you have a favourite gamemode which is fairly unknown and obscure, then there won't be very many people playing it, if you can even connect to the servers. Also, the amount of rubbish in the Steam workshop is appauling. To be clear, they do no give a proper description of their item, they make it unoriginal and generally trolly. This raises another problem, some of the greatest mods for it are lost in all of this. But those are just nitpicks. The WORST thing about this (In my opinion) is the fact that you need assests from other games to play much of this game. You will need Couter Strike: Source for TTT, Half Life 2 + Episodes for DarkRP, and so on. It feels like a newly released game has a glitch in it, and the devs make you pay for the patch. You can feel cheated, and your wallet will feel lighter. THE VERDICT Gmod by itself is about $10 US. The pack that includes CS:S is about $25 US. If you would prefer not to have all the errors, play TTT, use player models from CS:S then I would suggest getting the pack with both of them in it. However, if you are willing to save X amount of money by going and finding addons which will cover that, that will work as well but it will take up more of your time. SIMILAR GAMES -Think of a game. Any game. It's most likely been covered in Garry's Mod. That's how expansive this is. For more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview

Bill Cipher GONE 07/11 to 08/01;-;Garrys Mod The most enjoyable and mod filled game on steam, Garrys Mod. Garrys Mod is an amazing game with a good amount of gamemodes and lovely servers. You may want to play Sandbox and smack around batman or play TTT and rage because you were rdmed. Gameplay Garrys mod does not have a specific type of gameplay ranging from Prop Hunt to Stop It Slender. However your gameplay can be significantly improved by using the steam workshop and adding items. Mods Garrys mod is a game focused upon the premise of random and fun addons. I personally enjoy being a watermelon and firing pizzas from a bazooka. Garrys mod has an amazing amount of mods including characters and items. This is a game focused around its modding community. TTT (Trouble In Terrorist Town) TTT is the most famous gamemode in Garrys Mod. The premise of the game is simple. At the begining you are assigned a role, you are either an innocent bystander, a detective, or a traitor. However do not worry if you are innocent for this is trouble in terrorist town meaning everybody had guns. The innocent and the detectives try to find out who the traitors are while the traitors try to kill them all off. The gamemode is fun and server usually will have cool player models or gun. The main downside with TTT is rdmer's. RDM stand for Random Death Match and an rdmer is someone who out of the blue will try to kill you. This means an inno/detective randomly kills an inno/detective or a traitor kills an traitor or an inno just randomly kills someone who is a T. This really spoil's the gamemode making it unenjoyable at times but usually admins or mods will be on to help you or they will have an option to directly report it to kick/ban the person. Sandbox Sandbox is where creativity and stupidity flourish. Sandbox is where you can get all your downloaded mods and just have fun. Sandbox is just fooling around and having fun. It is one of Garrys Mod most hilarious game modes (if you play with the right people). Singleplayer/Muliplayer So if your planning on playing Sandbox I would recommend playing singleplayer or creating a hamachi or another program to play with a select group of friends, If you plan to play other gamemodes I suggest playing multiplayer and trying to find a nice server which you can enjoy. Rating Pros + fun alone or with friends + many gamemodes to enjoy + massive amount of creative and fun mods + overall great community + highly enjoyable Cons - rdmers - will end up overloading computer with mods Final Thoughts Garrys Mod is a must buy with its countless possibilities. It may take you a while to find a nice server or the gamemode that is for you but when you find it good times will be waiting. The mods are just so amazing that I salute all the mod makers for their effort and allowing me to become a watermelon with a portal gun.
Killer24nl;-;You must have this game if you are a real gamer!
Rexinexus;-;This is a mod that's a game, it even says it in the title. This "game" literally has no definition, the best way I can describe it is that it is a true sandbox game where there are no limits to what you can do / download. It's $10 for endless possibilities. NOTE: You MUST own Counter Strike: Source / most Valve games or else you will have a lot of missing textures.
Opel;-;Total freedom to let your stupid side out... Very fun to play with friends as well.
pixr900;-;Before FNAF = :D After FNAF = D: also having to buy cs:s to get most mods is a pain in the

JLEET;-;DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO MY CAPS LOCK BUTTON ISN'T BROKEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kawaii Mars;-;it's ok
TraviztY  | crimson.gg;-;If you're looking for a game but don't know what you want, Gmod is what you need. It has everything in it you can imagine, FPS Servers, Role Playing, Zombies, Prop Hunt, There is even a freaking DayZ Mod. Oh yea also all the mods will give you more script and texture errors than you could possibly imagine! Pink and black Checkerboards FTW!!! And lets not forget those 13 year old squeeky trolls that'll join your game and nuke everyone!! It's got everything! So if you're looking to waste hours of your life on something that will probably crash before you can save it, or be kicked from servers by childish admin, Then don't pass this one up! GG Garry, GG.... 11/10 It will crash again.
lavostoe11;-;Garry's mod (Gmod) shouldn't be rated by the opinion of others. Its what you make of it that engage its rating. How and what you do is completely up to you!
DJ Funky Fresh;-;Great game and it continues to provide me with hours of fun
Kalamitous;-;Yes, Garry's Mod was a great game...2 years ago. Now, the community is at its end. After YouTubers made videos about this game, the community poured with immature prebuscents. They are running unnecessary servers modeled after what they want, and not whats best for the server. We've got tons of player models for admins only, a bunch of poorly coded guns(M9K), and just a lot of unneeded addons clogging up loading time. Admins are super biased and abuse often. Yet, they still beg for donations after a week of the server's opening. And this isn't coming from me raging from one server. 95% of DarkRP and 50% of TTT servers are just like this. The Facepunch forums are usually kids asking how to make DarkRP jobs. You may wonder why I'm still playing this. I'm usually testing my addons in singleplayer. If you are pondering to get this game, it's the worst time to do so. This review probably won't affect your decision, but please do keep this in mind.
Crackpot;-;>Be me >Playing Garry's Mod infront of dad >Dad asks what game I'm playing >I tell him it's Garry's Mod >Dad is confused and baffled by this game in all its glory and asks me, "Son, why do you play such a childish game?" >uw0tm8.jpg >I begin to violently shake and scream inaudable words >Dad is spooked >I grab and begin to violently throw him around >I soon pin him down and put him in an awkward position >I place a box on his chest >He begins to violently shake and then he is thrown in the air thanks to the box >I laugh like a ing child for 2 minutes straight >Get shot by a pub scrub >I realize this is Garry's Mod not real life and my dad is looking at me like I'm crazy person expecting me to answer >Realize this isn't  and should sit in the corner for posting this green-text story. 10/10
[LAL]LuisRamii24;-;You can do anything you want in this game. There is such a lot of choices of game modes that you will never get bored of it. So much choices in the Workshop that you can always make this feel like a new game. All the gamemodes are so much fun as long as you play with friends making it even more fun
mostly nice;-;Ah, Garrys Mod. What is left to be said that has not already been written about this whimsical, sprite of a game. Chances are you have a friend that already plays this and has been telling you play it for a long time. Its time you took their advice and find out what all the fuss is about. Its a unique blast of a game that will keep you wat(ing) for not only hours but weeks, months & years.
bucket;-;When all else fails... add thrusters.
Cpl. Hicks;-;Download over 10 Games to play on one Game, then join a server and download 500+ addons, don't play the game and try joining other server's, join a TTT server, RDM happen's. 10.9999999/0 Would addon again.
HellishPanda;-;This would be known as a STEAM CLASSIC. If you like to build random and strange things, mess with ragdolls, enjoy a good RP or maybe killing zombies and terrorists I would recommend this for you. Games that are recommended (So you don't see giant error signs everywhere) Counter-Strike SOURCE* Half-life 2 Half-life 2 episode 1-2 and Lost coast for some maps. Any other valve games, when mounted. Will just give you an enchanced experience as well as more models from those games to  around with.
Duck;-;If you don't have this game then you don't have a life.
Dan;-;Bought the game -> Joined random server -> Spent 10 minutes downloading content -> Did something called 'RDM' -> Gets kicked from server -> Spent 20 minutes downloading more content -> Killed mod -> Kicked from server 20/10 best downloading simulator out there
The Flying Bear;-;Garry's Mod is not an ordinary game.It's a sandbox game.You have multiple game modes in it,which are very fun.Some of them are Prop Hunt,Trouble In Terrorist Town (my favourite),there is even a mod where you can be Slender Man.You can spawn items,characters,make some cool stuff,drive over some spies...You get many good achievements.The game doesn't really have goal,wait it does...HAVE FUN WHILE PLAYING! I recommend it to every player on this planet!
Celeryman;-;It's an Erotic Game. The most lewd, perverted and pornographic game I have ever played. Why is this not age restricted? Why this game is uncensored? Why some games are heavily censored and this game is not? Now I see where did Garry get his inspiration on making Rust...TFW butt naked people. Get Garry's Mod. Srly. Breast game ever.
Techno Viking;-;Great Game
NicoDerm CQ;-;Update: If this was more than two years ago, i would have totally recommended this game to everyone, as if this game should come with all PC's. Unfortunately not anymore. Do you remember when Spongebob and Patrick went through the perfume department and nearly died. Well that is what Garry's Mod is like nowadays. As you try and move into this new world and explore the opportunities placed out there for you, you don't get sprayed with perfume like in the show, you get ambushed by the worst community ever, comprised of (Worst being first); Toddlers who are still learning how to speak (who either scream or cry into dollar tree mic's), Furries (That are just utterly terrible), FNAF Autists (who are autists), Bronies (Most of which take a game too seriously many others are down right annoying), and Anime nerds (A group that is neither good nor bad as there are some mature people within the group where the good ones are meh.. But the bad ones are BAD.) It is a rare occurance to find an actual nontard man/ woman (age 16+) who doesn't throw a fit over a game, drop a ban hammer if questioned, or has the ability to squeal so loud into a mic it breaks the sound barrier and sends the listeners off to the gates of hell to be annally massacred by the spirit of the Autist himself/herself until a new PewDiePie vid comes on of him screaming into his monitor while he watches Diners, Driveins, and Dives, where then you are given the chance to crawl on all 4s out of there and back to your home. Browsing the Workshop is also just like the perfume department. Every page is loaded with the exact same content for FNAF. Let me repeat that... Exact... Same... FNAF content. Often there will be some anime/brony/furry things but all together aren't as oftenly seen as FNAF autist stuff. Let it be known if you can make it through all of that cancer, there is a nice variety of content waiting for you. You will mostly see all of this stuff jammed into multiplayer like Cinema (loaded with the bad anime nerds), Jailbreak (loaded with autists in general) or Simon Says as i would like to call it becauase you know... Nothing says Jailbreak like Simon Says. It doesnt even make sense but for some odd reason the kids who run these servers find it enjoyable to just play simon says for hours upon hours in a jail ment to be broken out of. The rp servers are a joke. You are hit with the same community and you should expect to be kicked or banned a lot quicker than usual, and TTT which is loaded with coppies of the fat kid from sandlot who love to butter themselves up to the mods. Only few make it out in one piece, that being me. You think I always looked like this? This is the face a person who survived the impossible and made it out with all most of his brain cells or atleast enough to type this all up. Do yourself a favor and only get this game if you want to just sit in sandbox mode with a friend or two and make stuff for fun. But do not do what i did and go into multiplayer because you might not make it back out the same. Its funny, it really is, just to sit back and watch a bunch of kids yell incomprehensibly at eachother.
ChairHandler;-;Super addictive and theres always something to do, even the glitches on this game are fun. . . :D
Beamz;-;Imagine everything Put into a game Nuff said
Falleax;-;You can make giant ding dongs out of bathtubs 10/10
Cheesy;-;Push past the arrogant kids, persistent es, and self-centered hackers, and you will meet life changing people. If someone states that this game is bad, they probably "trickshot" in CoD or mod Minecraft servers. 420/68 this game made me gay. jk
Nitecloud | S> Page 6 BP;-;4/10 I would've rated 10/10 if it wasn't for those kids who upload the EXACT SAME THING on the saves/dupes. I'm talking to you FNAF Fantards. Seriously, this game WAS great until FNAF came out! I remember the days when dupes were something people made for other people to have fun. Now it's just full of FNAF . I really do not reccommend this if you want to play multiplayer. I heard some people got banned for not liking FNAF. EDIT : Of course this will come to an end. But I will keep this review until it is 100% GONE
Bread;-;Used to be an amazing game; you could do whatever you want, play however you want, create any gamemode, etc. Now the game seems to be infested with servers run by 12 year olds, full of 12 year olds, and made for 12 year olds. Anyone over the age of 15 isn't liable to have fun in this game. Trust me, I played this game a lot; over 800 hours. It used to be a lot of fun and everyone was mature and had a good sense of humor. Now everything is just a jumbled up mess of lame internet references and god awful memes recited by 11-14 year old squeaker kids who probably stole a family member's card to purchase the game after seeing PoopiePie play it on YouTube. This is literally garbage now.
FrostBound;-;Garry's Mod is one of the best games i've seen, and the reason why its the best is in fact, the ever changing and updating mods that come out almost every week, with more content for either just plain simple sandbox that can keep you entertained for hours, or the ever changing mods that make this game fun in almost every way. This is a must buy.
FailCake :D;-;Still trying to figure out how to fly.
Anonymous;-;One of the best game I have ever played. So many options, and so much variety. If you like many games within one game this is the one. Most people probably know this game, and if you don't own it I can only recommend it. Worth every buck, and if you can get it on sale: You can't be dissapointed.
Ectoska;-;Used PAC 3 to make me have a banana . 11/10 Would have a banana for a  again.

Roselina;-;Nice game! :3
Flash!;-;It's ok.
Matt;-;Rest in Peace Colin Wyckoff.
RaptoR;-;The legendary mother of all sandbox games! You can find pretty much everything in this game: classic sandbox (ofc everyone spamming stuff as fast as they can :D) Prop Hunt, Murder, Theater, Trouble in Terrorist Town and many many many more. Best fun with friends and even with complete randoms.
DainTech_The_Pyro;-;I dont typically do reviews for games, but with a game such as this it is quite "worth" as i have heard these children saying. I decided i needed to keep this review "hip" with some catchy "lingo" to "spice up" things. so "brb" "inb4" "10/10 IGN - Best game of 2016". I dont know what else to put here as my name alone should have made you buy this game and donate to my quest of building an army of super robots for my own personal use, so here is a poem and useful info: roses are red violets are violet refrigerator. no, i would not like to build a snowman, my super robot army keeps me quite occupied. For apple pie: ingredients: 1 box Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts, softened as directed on box 6 cups thinly sliced, peeled apples (6 medium) 3/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 tactical nuke 1/4 teaspoon salty spitoon, how tough are ya? 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 tablespoon lemon juice step one: Heat oven to 420F. Place 1 pie crust in ungreased 9-inch glass pie plate. Press firmly against side and bottom. step two: In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into crust-lined pie plate. Top with second crust. Wrap excess top crust under bottom crust edge, pressing edges together to seal; flute. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust. step 3: Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender/dank and crust is golden brown. Cover edge of crust with 2- to 3-inch wide strips of foil after first 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent excessive browning. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving.

Greene180;-;Now... You may find it interesting that I have so many hours invested into this game. You may also find it interesting that I continue to play a game many would view as limited. I would certainly say that I have studied this game more than most men would study a new natural element. Now, this is where you ask for my in-depth analysis on such a game. A thesis on everything I have learned from my experience. Yet I only have a short few words... This game has robbed me of my soul. Robbed me of my life. It has shown me that my life is an empty shell that I fill with fake memories in the form of online gaming, and more specifically, this game. I, and all that participate in online gaming as well as Garry's Mod are currently doing this. Building fake memories with fake people that are hidden behind a fake setting. Nameless people behind faceless screens. Ever changing, never moving. But the game was okay. 8/10

JCDENTON;-;I played for a little bit but it was ok.
swann delevingne;-;Can you imagine the most  thing? yeah... you can't, because there is always this game on the very ing podium. Garry's mod will for sure give you some brain damages but always a very good time, espeacially if you play it with your friends. Enjoy it, it is on sale very often. 10/10 - asdfghjkl NPC sasha is out, peace.
lightningsand;-;this game is epic (but without mods it can be totaly lame)
Prodigalist;-;it's ok
TheForgery;-;Introduction: Garry's mod, or Gmod for short as many know it, is a game that doesn't have any boundaries that hinder creativity. You don't play to win, you play to have fun. It's pretty difficult to review Gmod due to its unique nature and everyone's playstyle is different to which I am not excluded from. Unlike my other reviews, I made this concise to make it easier to read but preserving the important details. Things to do in Gmod: You can spawn props, ragdolls, etc to make a scene which can be funny or depicts art, download add-ons from the workshop to fire new weapons, explore a map, or enhance graphics, and even make action scenes by setting off chain explosives or start a firefight among NPCs. Upon being bored with singleplayer, you can join an online server and do roleplay, survive in a zombie apocalypse, and compete with other players. There are also tools created by others to help with whatever actions one partakes in Gmod. Improved photo-taking management, better face-posing, the list goes on. Problems: Some major issues I encountered was it's not easy to play co-op (and what I mean by that is you only want to play with a couple of friends in an isolated server). You have to use Evolve to do that or some other method. Downloading too many add-ons, like I did, can make the game sluggish to load and it may take a while for it to load a map. Moreover, if an add-on conflicts with another, it will crash the game. Gmod doesn't include all the materials and resources from other Valve/Source games, thus they must be purchased to enjoy the game fully. If not, errors can occur and they are most abhorred. Conclusion: Gmod is a game that everyone must play. It is adjustable to anyone's preferred method of enjoyment and it's hard to not have fun.

Csm;-;This is more addicting than any drugs out in the streets right now.

Mikasa;-;You can make really awesome Photo's and its really fun to play. I Make all my photo's here! So yes i would recommend you to get this game.
magnific-america;-;Amazing! This started out as simple mod for Half-Life 2 in 2004 and transformed into a fully modifiable sandbox creation! Started with only a physics gun, balloon gun, wheel gun, and entity / prop spawner then became much MUCH more as the years went by. A true testiment to the powers of community created mods for retail games. A show of reason why developers should always allow communities to create more upon their masterpieces. Bravo VALVe for allowing Garry to do as he pleased with Half-Life 2 and the source engine.
MythicalBubbles;-;Personally, I love this game because of the unlimited things you can do in it! You can join servers and make new friends, you can make a server and play with your friends, and a lot more!
industrial strength lubricant;-;glued two horses together and killed someone with it 10/10
GreenBlack;-;Great game. Extremely much variety.
Rubat;-;A sandbox game where you can basically do whatever you want. Easy mod access from Steam Workhop. The game is very unstable though, it is bound to have crashes, and long loading times should you install a lot of addons. It needs polishing.
Professor Pyg;-;It was good... until Pewdiepie played it. Now only 10 year old little kids play it
kijib;-;PSA: Garry is planning to incorporate paid mods in his game http://garry.tv/2015/04/24/paying-for-mods/ on top of this he has insulted modders on his twitter, the same people that he owes his success to for making garry's mod so great so not only does he want to profit off of the mods he is already profiting on, but he has the nerve to insult them http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/33tqr5/according_to_garry_newman_most_of_the_modding/ we as gamers should not stand for this, which is why I'm changing my review from postive to negative UPDATE: Altogh paid mods are gone for now, I fear they will return Garry still showed his true colors by supporting paid mods and insulting modders, if Valve hadn't suspended paid workshop as they have for the time being nothing would change, my review stands Garry is not a friend to gamers and his customers

Alice.;-;Amazing game with so many different game modes to play in. I've met so many of my friends on this game, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. It's so fun and super addicting.
AmericanGiraffe;-;Pesonally my favorite game I own. You can probably tell this because it says: 21.7 hrs last two weeks / 413.3 hrs on record Garry's Mod is a first person sandbox game, that has almost no limitations due the to workshop community. Because of the amount of game-modes, it is almost impossible to get bored of. DarkRP, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, G-Mod Racer, Gun Gaym (Yes it is spelled like that), Apoc, Melon Runner, Just to name a few. But do keep in mind, if you do not have really fast internet speed, or major patients, you may not like this game. Generally when joining servers, it takes a while to download all the workshop item, skins, and textures. Also, to play most game-modes such as DarkRP, or Apoc, the game requires other games such as CS:S or HL2 to play, but the textures needed can be downloaded off the internet. Personally, I give this game a 10/10. Do I think it is worth the price? Hell yes. I would be willing to pay around $40 for this game. I would reccomend buying this with keys from a game dealer on steam, or buying it during the Steam Summer Sale, just because it has dropped all the way down to $2.50 before. As I said erlier, this is my favorite game, and definantly worth the price. Get buyin, steam community!
Chief;-;Just an awesome game made on the Source engine , do whatever you want to !
Hizzang;-;I can kill anything with anything while looking like anything and doing all this in any map ever. The vanilla game is amazing but mods make this game what it is.
Ryster_;-;Made a car from a horse, got banned from several servers for mass RDM, and shot Batman in the testicles.

Frost :(;-;It has melons, 10/10.
Designated Kitty 03-052;-;I spawn a few thousand explosive barrels and feel good about myself
ErrolLiamP;-;Garry's Mod. A game that is way too addictive. I did not know that buying this game would will my life with hours of repeated gameplay. An amazing sandbox, filled with addons and awesome gamemodes along with SWEPs, STOOLs, SENTts, SNPcs, maps, playermodels, textures and addons! You will find yourself spending countless hours filled with physics and 1 rule. You are god, well, only on sandbox. My favorite game, this is like first person little big planet. I'm not lieing when I say, you can LITERALLY do anything you desire in this game from cars, to zombie survivals, to roleplay, to parkour, to slender, to making addons! Please buy this, I promise, you won't regret it. I have yet to find a person who does not enjoy this amazing gameplay. 10/10 stars ~ErrolLiamP
SkittleFart;-;With over 330 hours in-game I figured I should write a review. But you wanna know the truth? I DONT KNOW WHAT THIS GAME IS MAN! ONE MINUTE IM PLAYING A HORROR MAP, THE NEXT IM BEING QUESTIONED ABOUT A MURDER! WHAT ARE YOU!!!! *sobs* Just buy the damn game.. It's what he wants.. 12/10
Lepper;-;Oh Garry's Mod 13, why did you have to ruin EVERYTHING? Gmod used to be a great sandbox game with a few bugs here and there, but then that dreaded day where Gmod 13 came out changed everything. The game only went downhill by that point. For some reason they decided that removing half of the props was a good idea. Those really cool and useful tools that you use all the time? Nah, we're just going to remove them for you. Got some pesky bugs in your single player map? We don't care since Gmod is played Multiplayer more than Singleplayer. You used to be able to build pretty much everything imaginable with the old addons and possible extra addons that you could download from e.g. garrysmod.org, but sadly that is now no longer possible. Obvioulsy you can still have lots of fun with all these new online gamemodes, but Singleplayer just ain't what it used to be anymore.

Angus The Turtle;-;I've had over 1,300 hours in this game. I'd have to say the most fun modes are Dark RP and Flood. This game is definetly worth the $5 (It is usually on sale all the time). What I would say the worst thing about this game is all the godamn ing squekers that blow my godamn eardrums out. Does it look like I want to come home from school and babysit a bunch of ing 12 year olds? NO! You should be able to report squekers and maybe theyd get a vac ban from garrys mod or some . IDK. But anyways you could mute them but I don't really want to take 15 seconds out of my time to find their ing name and mute them. Although that is the only issue I wish there were more tutorials within the game that taught you how to make stuff. Even though I know how to make alot of stuff using wire mod and all that jazz I wish I didn't have to teach my friends everything. Anways 69/10 would play again if there aren't in 12 year olds on the server. if there are then 0/10.
[APG]RoboCop[CL];-;If you love Half-life 2 then try this game out for wacky fun!
Carrythxd;-;Ive played it for about an hour now and already love it! :D
Wrigley;-;So fun. So many game modes to play, so many hours spent. So worth. It is your sandbox.
~;-;This game is so much fun!! I love just going around and spawing random stuff! Also I love how you can customize it by downloading mods, and other stuff. I like how you can play multiplayer too! I totally recomend this game to anyone who loves creating random stuff!
4texas the zombiemutt;-;i havent play much garrys mode but its ok day 569 i havet seen another person in so long i might die soon o no it the admin fghgfjfgjhdfgjdfgj
WheATz_ReAPerZ;-;This Game Was Pretty Good Before Fnaf Fan Took Over.......
zell;-;Pretty cool game; haven't played it much though.
Sound of Slewlfn Moving;-;Cried a bit at the end of it.
DragonSlayer1177;-;This game is amazing. Just plain amazing. You can do whatever you want, whether it be building on your own, playing games on a public server, etc. There are tons of different game modes, including murder, hide and seek, and Prop hunt. 100 out of 100!!!!!!!!
Mobert;-;Countless hours have been lost way into the night due to Garry's Mod, and i'm still finding enjoyment from playing it. Garry Newman may have made the base game, but without the wonderful community of creators, Garry's Mod would be nothing. An absolute blast with friends (I recommend Trouble In Terrorist Town for the most laughs), and a general meaty package of worth-while content.
Sound of Slewlfn Moving;-;Cried a bit at the end of it.
Th4ts_iT;-;Actually this game is very famous so a review is not that important. Garry's Mods real sense is to simulate physics and to be a sandbox game. When you play it like it this I agree that it can be fun but it's more fun if you play other gamemodes. First of all, there is Trouble in Terrorist Town. In this gamemode you have to uncover traitors or as a traitor you have to kill the innocents. That's a really short describtion but it's basically it. TTT is a great gamemode to play for several hours at a time. Secondly, there is Prophunt. In Prophunt you have whether to hide as a prop or to find the fake props. This gamemode makes a lot of fun as well as TTT. Last example is Deathrun. Like the name says, this gamemode is about to run away from the death or actually to run and avoid the death. Deathrun is a bit more difficult sometimes and has a decent rate of despair often. Nevertheless, it's fun! Of course all of these gamemodes require friends to play with. So if you want to play funny games with your friends and only buy one game then get Garry's Mod
Kaguban;-;Garry's Mod has countless gamemodes for you and your friends to play. I really recomend playing it with friends, even without friends there are tons of things to do that make Garry's Mod an amazing game.
Silux199;-;If you ever wanted to be a toilet paper this is your chance! 1. Install the Game 2. Join a Prop hunter Server 3. Become a toilet paper 4. Be happy that you are a toilet paper 5. Troll the hunters 6. Get killed Would buy the Game again 10/10
frostets;-;TL;DR I'll make a honest review about this game. Garry's mod is a physics sandbox, which means that there aren't really any goals in this game but you make your own goals on what you want to achieve in your sandbox. They give you enough tools for constructing a bunch of things that come up from your mind like rockets, vehicles, catapults, robots and a lot of crazy things. This game isn't really all about imagination or constructing things, there's also many unique and fun multiplayer gamemodes to play such as; Trouble in Terrorist town, Prop Hunt, Hide and seek, Cinema, darkRP, Elevator: Source and many more. Some gamemodes require a game to avoid missing/error textures, but that doesn't mean you need to buy the required game. You can download game files and place it in the garrysmod folder but however I still recommend buying the games. One of my favourite features about this game is the workshop, where you can subscribe to many different addons and gamemodes. I also highly suggest you don't download too much addons as it can lag the game and sometimes break it. Another thing I like about this game is that you can make posters and screenshots of ragdoll poses which can be also fun. The best thing about this game is that it's worth your money buying this game. Pay once, and have hours of fun. The thing is that I didn't buy the game myself, but a kind and generous person bought it for me when it was in a huge deal. I would also like to thank that person for purchasing this game as a gift for me. Overall I would highly recommend this game. If you don't own the game yet and you're reading this, please do buy it now if you want to have loads of fun. If you can't, you don't need to. This isn't really related but I felt really shocked. Anyway, a famous youtuber who has made many Garry's Mod films and shorts by the username of Kitty0706 has passed away on 1/25/2015 after 2 years of fighting leukemia and he was one of my favourite youtubers of all time. He has inspired me to type all of these. I expect a few downvotes but it doesn't really matter as this is how much I love Garry's Mod. If you have read all of these, I would like to thank you for using your time. I'm sorry if my review had any gramatical errors, but if you're reading this I hope you have a great day.
UnchartedSpork96;-;I rate did gam 7/10 cuz ther is naw CoD DLC! -IGN Wow there is so much anime fgdsgjfduighdfg! -Some neglected person in a basement It crashes, lags, and is one of the worst games I have played. -Adolf Hitler I cann mak modz! -Steam ITH THE BETHST! -You
Copy That Zigzagoon;-;Super duper fun game. So fun i held in my poop for 2 hours just to play the game more! I am now constipated... but at least I have Gary's Mod!!!
[GT14]FrontRUSSIAN;-;YOU CAN BACKSTAB YOUR FRIENDS AND THEN SELL DRUGS TO PEOPLE ! MUST BUY!!!!
SGT.Bigmac;-;Its like Skyrim with physics
PK Smokey;-;Literally the best part about Gmod is spawning a giant pens above squeakers, effectively crushing them with your giant pens, then climbing in your giant pens and driving over their crushed corpse with your giant pens because your giant pens also doubles as a car.
Dr. Frog;-;Best $10 you can ever spend. Ever.
OfficallYNoTaLosseR;-;while I had fun in the beginning once you dive into the worlds of cinema and ttt you can see how  and awful community. If mics and chat aren't being spammed with little kids, racist, sexist, and pornographic content the ing admin abuse is truly something out of the worst horror stories you've heard. Just now I was on cinema and 3 of these main issues occurred 1. In the lobby a man was spamming his mic with some "dank memes" like "m'lady" and some really messed up mlp  2. while in the theater the only videos that anyone would request was porn, mostly gay or some kind of  fetish. 3. and finally when a normal video would come on the ing piece of  admin would blow up everyone in the theater. and all those things bring me here to you, right now writing this admittedly angry and hostile review. So in conclusion I can say 1.  this game and 2.  this community P.S. have a nice day
Element 109;-;I think my hours put into this game speaks the loudest. It's fun, addicting, and I've made almost all of my friends on it. You can spend hours at a time or minutes on it and it fits pretty much anyone's busy schedule. High replay value and definitely worth the "iffy" price. The community has a huge influence on the game and although the graphics are terrible, who really plays a game for the graphics? Some of the best games I've ever played have had awful graphics but that doesn't mean they are trash games. The creative can flourish here with more gamemodes than you can shake a stick at with endless scenarios and possibilities.
SnowFez;-;This game .... if you do not have it .... sell all you have ..... but buy this game .... and stop reading reviews and buy this game now! :D
Double;-;Has Melon.
Ryan;-;Ever since Garry's Mod 11 came out, I was sticked to the computer screen. Since then, gaming have never been the same to me, in the good way. Garry's Mod made my creativity explode in my mind, because I had so many oppertunities! Everything from the weirdest TF2 content, to amazing machineries and artworks! Dupes, saves, maps, weapons, everything imaginable can either be made or found on the workshop! Even with amazing gamemodes! The only thing I have encountered as a problem yet, is crashes, which is easy fix! I most certainly recomend this game to everyone!
Juuzou;-;Garry's Mod is a very good game. Consisting of lots of fun things to do with such a big variety of gamemodes. If you want a game to play that is very entertaining, get this. 10/10.
[Domino] {Firey};-;This game is an amazing time wasting when your bored and also you can do everything you want, i find this game an exellent one!
Uzzzzzai;-;The one and only game where the addon folder is over 87GB big. And as of 2015-June-18, it is 159 GB. . .
GarneT~;-;It was cool, then the FNaF virus came and swept our nation.
MRAMNESIA8;-;Idk what to say, except that this game is pretty ing awesome! 10/10 for graphics 10/10 for play style 10/10 for the idea -995/10 for the RDMERS on DarkRP Anyway this game is what every gamer wants! a game where u can play other games, or even make you're own games! :D it's AWESOMEMEMEMEMEMEMEMMEM :D
[AGC] MannacanbySins;-;This is awesome, the amount of variety in it is amazing. If you want something you will NEVER get bored of get this
cispierce(a.k.a Captdoe1);-;From TTT to DarkRP, Garry's Mod is the one game that you can really do anything with (sort of) realistic graphics. Want to play a Zombie Survival Gamemode? Done. Want to do a survival gamemode(like minecraft and Rust, but just smaller)? Done. The point I'm trying to get across is that when you buy this game, you can technically call it buying a bunch of games. To me, this is just the kick-off point of the game. Games like Murder and Slender are fairly new gamemode.Oh and dont forget the Workshop! The community is great. Which, is actually where you install some of the game modes. Also, the classic sandbox mode is a great way to get used to the game. From the workshop, I can spawn in a dubstep gun in sandbox mode and spawn in a few NPC's to test it on. So, anyhow, if you are looking for a game with a wide choice of playing, choose this game. You won't regret it.
incognegro;-;dozens of hours into this game and i still have no clue who garry is
Pacman;-;This game is really fun, you can play with your friends and make funny photos with your friends and feel free to do whatever you like in this game
Joe;-;Awesome game? Nah. Got alot of kids. When u see grown ppl Catch them. They make it more funnier
Desert Fox;-;You can pretty much do whatever you want in this game. It allows you to use the models and maps from a majority of the Source games and put them together to build your own games for all of your friends and the rest of the world to enjoy. With a massive community constantly contributing to the content there is always something new to try out.
Fherrera #afk for while;-;No words need to say, you can almost to everything in this game. Valve's source engine in best use with fair price
Chuck Fucking Hoxton;-;It's a game where you control the world. You can make it be whatever you want. You want to spawn NPCs to fight off hordes of zombies? You can do that. You want to make cars, planes, trains, and rollercoasters? You can do that. You want to play in elaborate roleplaying servers? You can do that. It's also a good tool for making videos, as Youtube can show you. All in all, it's up to you to decide how much fun you have and how you use the game. Good luck in all your endeavors!
StreenG;-;Ruined my life,best game ever!
BeanBag 117;-;Honestly GMOD is one of the best games i have ever played for one reason and one alone. YOU.CAN.MESS.AROUND.DOING.WHATEVER.YOU.WANT.
Cheever;-;I have been playing garry's mod for a few years now and its really all i play. This game truely has endless possibilities. Want to develop a new game(mode)? You can do that here with the immense modding/coding capability. Want to just play a fun game? TTT, Prophunt, DarkRP are only a few of the gamemodes. Like to build? Garry's mod has many props that you can build with and can be added to the library. 11/10 IGN
Jaz;-;For this Price a game that you can enjoy with friends and have a great fun time... it is a must buy!
[FL] SoulRipper;-;Great game with many possibilities. Good physics engine and since update of Gmod13, highly improved.
Zadrave;-;Facepunch is too hard 0/10 I like this game
[Emp'G]Niandra Lades;-;I can safely say This game is awful
homicide hare;-;i logged onto a server and someone was recreating 'the human centipede'

Ykredfield;-;In this game, almost everything is possible!
Cosaka;-;This game never gets old.

Girl Gamer Guardian;-;Get yelled at by kids who think they're smarter than you and/or better than you. 10/10
NYAN.NYAN;-;creative games !
Hirokishi;-;Garry's mod what can I say in my opinion a great game that allows you to do what you want to designate his own target in the game and build a variety of strange and interesting buildings because the game has no main objective. The game has a lot of different games modes so everyone can find something for everyone. It has a lot of interesting modifications in the Workshop steam created by the players. In my opinion, the game is really interesting and cool graphics which have created on the Source engine. The game gives me really a lot of fun in boring evenings. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a really nice atmosphere created by the players and of course fun. ^_^ My rating 10/10
MunchNPlay;-;You just need to know 1 thing , get this game and dont look back , you make it , you create it , you play it . Easy to use Gui and nice feel to the campaigns those have made , huge community and creativity, some servers are egh 12yr old admins but beyond that fun game modes , have a blast with the friends or scare one another in some intense games/gamemodes.
Eve Leaf;-;A Brillient Game of Creation, Imagination And Utter Fun, I Have Played Gmod The Most As I Loved Playing It My Way, You Can Create Anything To Your Imagination, Like your Own Gamemode, A Car That Has Lazers on It and Erm... I Better Not Discribe That Evil On my Computer Screen But In General Gmod Can Inspire Alot Of Games Being Made, To MMORPG's to classic Shoot them up's, I Recommend this if you want to Let all those idea's out of your head and Express your creativity!
SuperTony64;-;This game has been a waste of my time. It literaly sucked the life out of me. I have pretty much done nothing but play this  game all day and night. This game was a waste of money.................thats why i freaking love it
wizrad;-;achievement unlocked: 420
[6te] Duke;-;This game is amazing! With various different ways to play the game, surely it'd be great. It's like games within a game. This game is quite old though, but it doesn't make it bad. I'd absolutely recommend this game as it isn't a waste of your money and many people play it to this day. Though, you still need Counter Strike: Source and Half Life 2 (As recommended).
Seraph-San;-;Garry's Mod is one of those games that you have too much fun on, and that is not at all a bad thing. Single player or multiplayer, there is always a way to entertain yourself; whether its just playing a sandbox game with your friends and making all kinds of kooky contraptions, playing on your own a building a scene for a comic, screenshot, or animation, or even getting the pants scared off of you by playing some of the custom horror maps the workshop has to offer. Not to mention all the fun game modes like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt, and many more. So yes, Garrys Mod is a must play for any gamer who still knows what a game is supposed to be about; Pure unadulterated fun.
BaneOfCreation;-;SSSSSOOOOOOO addicting you can do anything you can imagine even get addons to improve your gaming experience!! And it has melons, bouncy balls and im sure someone's done nudes on the workshop!!
TheRedHeadDevil;-;Welcome to Garry's mod! a place full of joy and wonder! There are a countless amount of things you can do in Garrys mod. Want to interact with other people and play mini-games? Gmod-Tower is the perfect place for you. want to survive the zombie apocolaypse in an epic fashion? or do you want to eat the brains of the survivors and rub it in their faces? Zombie panic is perfect for you. You can also create tons of inventions ir mess around with the ragdolls if you like. One of those smart guys that figured out how to code Source? Get this! With the right people involved you can even create your OWN gamemode! Crazy right? There's just no end to the possibilities that this gem has to offer... heck even some people make animations with the ragdolls (preferably tf2 ragdolls) and make videos. There is just no end to the possibilities, and that's what makes Garry's mod a true sandbox game.
LordByte;-;I am wasting my life on this, too much stuffs to do.
Nitush;-;>buys a 600 dollar graphic card >talks about playing graphic intense games >plays Garrys mod >get banned by admin >10/10
Avakado;-;Great story, very tuching. I cried at the end when Charles had to leave boston to work at the coal mines. The game play is ok for an painting game. The AI also insta kills you at times. When I tried to draw mona lisa the AI Elsa killed me for no reason. It had no relation to the story as well so I think it is a bug. But if you can see past the bugs and the wierd AI this is a great first person racing game! 10/10
Awesome Sauce;-;Almost 2k hours on record, this game is endless fun. It's literally impossible to get bored with gmod.
LibertyBaller;-;Live any virtual life you want but with a side effect of ruining your real life.
MrNiceGuy518;-;To positively review any single aspect of this truely excellent game wouldn't do it justice - Garry's Mod is what you make of it. To me, it's my creative portal - anything I want built can be built, be it a wooden shack or an autonomous aircraft carrier, it can be done. With some of the amazing things that come from the workshop, (and formerly garrysmod.org) the game knows no bounds. When using custom game modes, Garry's Mod can transform into any kind of gameplay experiance imaginable - From the classic freedom of Sandbox, to the backstabbing drama of Trouble in Terrorist Town, to the simulated communities of DarkRP and Perp, to the intense clock-race engineering of FloodMod, and many, many more game modes that simply haven't played yet, this game holds a special place in my heart.
TDM;-;TOTALLY AWESOMENESS
InfernoKun;-;Awesome must have game :D. So many things to do.
Mini BerlinerKuchen(>-)>;-;Got called a big meany by some little kid on some crappy DarkRP server. I threw a stove at the .
NovaHex;-;An invigorating 'Sandbox' game. Created with no rules or goals, you're able to play Garry's Mod however you see fit. With a large community of modders, you're able to download their work directly to your 'Addons Library.' Mostly anything is possible with this game. Mostly. Just don't get to crazy with the mods, you may end up crashing you game, or being surprisingly irritated with crazy long error codes spamming your screen. Other than that, if you happen to grab a copy, good on you! 10/10
CreepyKittyCat;-;I've spent numerous hours playing this game and I simply love it. It's a great game to get together with friends and just joke around and supports great gamemodes. 10/10
Cryo;-;This is hands down, the most funnest game to play that I have ever played. If you have Steam, and don't own this game, it's like your profile never existed
AzaZog;-;:D Best Game Ever 10/10 The game by itself is boring, but with the right mods and right games, you can have a fun time with friends :D
Rickdaddy;-;Who is garry?????????????????
Mitchell;-;The game that just never gets old... Garry's Mod is amazing, even on it's own and even after years of running a outdated engine it's still an incredibly popular game with many modifications to expand the fun for ever and ever. There's soo many addons in the Steam workshop to ensure this is the game you'll NEVER get bored of, it doesn't need a good computer runs smoothly even on a Intel HD 4000. Although being an outdated game it can't use up all of the cores on a modern computer making single player quite choppy during intense calculations. It also is heavily dependent on a good ping to ensure that online gaming is fun, your ping is a important number, you need it to be as low as possible for some gamemodes but for some even around 300 is fine. Garry's Mod can be funny and entertaining, you can do whatever you want and forever; if you have the skills you can build ANYTHING you want and then share it with the duplicator to the Steam workshop for all your friends and people of the internet to download and spawn in their game. I'd highly recommend this to a friend and already have 10/10
Dr. Clayton;-;This game has ruined my life. I can't stop playing it. Praise GABEN.
DanTDM;-;a very funny interesting game. 5 stars
Sanik;-;Garry's Mod is a really, great game for people of all ages; even the autistic children can figure out how to get Lua errors within 2 seconds of launching it. Pro's with the game. -Brings out the inner artist. -Easy to learn (even a child with aspies can learn how to uninstall it). -Educates the Gaming community on who ed your mother. -Easy to read Lua Errors. -Pretty simplistic hud and menu. -Promotes the "Rustling of Jimmies". -Some Admins aren't stupid. -Workshop is great and user friendly. Cons -Promotes terrorism. -Other Admins are 12 year children. -No Seth Hacks available. -Mingebags . -Gayry Newman. -Replaced Toybox with Dupes. -FNAF. In conclusion, I rate this game 9/11. Mainly because I can suicide bomb in most Trouble in Terrorist Town servers. Aloha Snackbar.

Rager.exe;-;Got killed with an oven. 10/10
Expensive Antique Chair;-;Shrek add-on 10/10 would play again.
Billetjes;-;This game is so brilliant! 12/10!!!
Cannon Cat;-;Default Gamemode- Sandbox: Make anything you feel like cause why the hell not. TTT: Kill the traitors cause they are bad. Dark RP: Make money printers and run your own... whatever you want to run. Prophunt: Hide and seek with props and guns. +A million more gamemodes to play. F. U. N.
Moka;-;addiction x.X
Joker;-;Have fun with this sandbox game.Mostly I recommended you guys to play Trouble In Terrorist Town.
Barney the erectile dinasour;-;Yes, I know this game is no longer that modern in comparison to other major game series such as Call Of Duty or Fifa, but I feel that this game deserves all positive reviews none the less, so Ill get started. Im going to presume that none of you have ever had sex before (why else would you be here, sitting in front of your computer reading reviews of a game released in 2006). Im also going to presume that, at some point in your life, you want to have sex, but lets be frank here, you're probably never get to have it. Well now, thanks to this game you will no longer need to as this game is EASILY comparable to sex. I have owned this game for well over a year now, and I have had over 2691 s purely from playing this game. The only complaint I have about this game is the fact that there is no way to get physically intimate with this game (and the fact it occasionally gets compatibility issues with out of date workshop mods) but other than that this is one of the greatest games I have ever played. So on that note, I shall wrap up this review before I go on to much about how bootylicious this game is, or how much of a sex pest this game has made me, or the fact I had to replace my computer because my cooling system was so full of . So in conclusion, if you dont get this game you will be guaranteed to die a virgin (although this game wont change that fact, it means you wont be bothered by that fact, as playing this game is just as good, if not better than sex! ) So buy this game now or youll never know the true meaning of pleasure.
Barack Obama;-;Nice game. Funny to play with friends and to do things like Roleplaying. Worthe the 10$!
PimpMasterBroda;-;I troll you long time on here.
Cyber_Trigger;-;This is the best game I ever played! It never gets boring, you can play on community maps, you have lots and lots of addons! Fun + Never gets boring + Can play it with friends in multiplayer + [ I can't find nothing bad ] Rating: 5/5
Fogo;-;This is very nice game , so many mods, weapons , maps, its so enjoyable with your friends. What are you waiting BUY IT !
(NMRIHBA's)Fox Mulder;-;So much fun! You start out with the stuff they give you, and then you can download new weapons and cars. It's so cool! Everyone needs to play this game!
Shady;-;Gamemodes filled with RDMers and 7 year old squeakers being told that they have annoying voices by other 7 year old squeakers. 10/10
Banter;-;A game where i can do shet xD when i feeling stressed, i just simply play this friking free to all game >u< wanna know what free to all mean ? - you want to killing game go on - you want to be friendly go on - you want gore go on, if have dismemberment mod - you want Racing go on - you want 420 MLG noscope go on - you want play flying plane go on - and many more c: cons : - some addons require base game, like this map require HL2 EP2 installed - idk about more cons on this game thats all, have fun with this game c: lots of free addons
Abandoned;-;Play this game when you aren't in the mood. This game brings you to Dream Land where you can use mods. I rate this game 10/10
Achiko A.;-;I've been playing this game for alot of hours but still can't get tired of it, alot of amazing mods to play, my favorite one is Trouble in terrorist town and Cinema, but still there are whole bunch of gamemodes that I have not tried yet. you can do almost anything in this game, in sandbox you can build stuff and mess around. Just a great game, I definitely recommend this!!! what are you waiting for? go get it!
Sen3.141592653589793238462643383;-;One of the best sandbox game I have ever played. Huge and when I mean huge I do mean HUGE variety of gamemode to play from and addons. Even though this game was a mod for an old game, it still has an very active community and multiplayer. I reccomend you to get it it's only 10$ for over 300+ of game time. 10/10 Would get RDMed again
0 division;-;still better than minecraft
I have good grammer;-;I have to buy a lot of games in order to get rid of the pink checkers.
Ryuunosuke The Hikikomori;-;Just watch this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uneSOPqqAFw Thats my review on Garry's Mod.
[KL] Master Dan [StormCats];-;There is so much fun to be had, however it requires friends to play it, otherwise you find yourself wandering around in and out of servers with strangers who don't care about you and will kill you. The game itself is extremely versatile, with so much scope for adaptation and expansion. A more simpler easier-to-navigate interface would have been prefered, but that's my own opinion as a mature gamer. For instance, there is a LOT you have to learn before you can even figure out what you 'have to do' to play this game. My advice is find a friend who knows how to play the game or the basics at least, and take it from there. Remember, you have to own and have installed any game with the source engine, be it Halflife2 Counter strike source etc (there is a bundle on offer at the moment for CS Source + Gary's Mod. I would recommend this game to everyone who is into round-based, team deathmatches and the like. A headset and mic is very advantageous.
Lady Eden;-;I gave this game a try.
sdfefasdf;-;My brain exploded with this game. 3 times.
[EG]Purple;-;sweet game for anyone :D
[P.G.]Hal;-;Garry's Mod(abbreviated GMod) is a really, really, really, really open sandbox game. Garry's Mod provides its players with all of the tools to practically do whatever the heck they want, when the want to do it. In Garry's Mod, you may either choose to play singleplayer and screw around with things, or you may play the multiplayer of the game and participate in one of to 100+ gametypes to choose from. These gamemodes themselves also provide plenty of servers for you to choose from. In the Sandbox gametype alone, the servers can range from being a simple, peaceful environments where players can gracefully construct whatever their hearts may desire without harm being brought upon them -- to a sandbox server with frequent violent occursions while some players are building -- to an extremely hecktic sandbox server where players are fighting for their own lives to even TRY to build. In the innovative DarkRP gametype, you have servers that can range from realistic, good-sporty experiences -- to a serious roleplay server where gangsters cower away from the patrolling police instead of jumping out like freaking lunatics -- to DarkRP servers with very frequent unjustified shootouts, random death-matching, spawnkilling, and propkilling -- to roleplay servers where there is a perfect blend of chaos and serious roleplay -- to Half Life 2 roleplaying servers in which you try to roleplay as a citizen during the combine oppression(this actually has its own gametype, Clockwork) -- to other roleplay servers that include vicious, mindless, blood-thirsty zombies that come out to try and murder you while you attempt to properly roleplay in a wasteland environment. There are also other popular gamemodes such as Jailbreak, Flood, Zombie Survival, Trouble in Terrorist Town(TTT), Deathrun, and Prophunt just lying out there waiting for you to join right in and participate in the uniquely fun experiences that each of them has to offer. Don't think that Garry's Mod would be a waste of your $10(will be less on Steam sales), because Garry's Mod will provide you with enough gaming entertainment to last you up to several years. The only issue about Garry's Mod is that some maps in the game(most of the maps are customly created by players), along with some weapons(M9K is a popular custom weapons pack), entities, SNPCs("Scripted-Non-Player-Characters" or "AI") that are customly made, and vehicles(SCARs is a popular custom vehicle pack) require you to own: CS:S(Counter Strike: Source) http://store.steampowered.com/app/240, DoD:S(Day of Defeat: Source) http://store.steampowered.com/app/300, HL2:EP1(Half Life 2: Episode 1) http://store.steampowered.com/app/380, HL2:EP2(Half Life 2: Episode 2) http://store.steampowered.com/app/420, TF2(Team Fortress 2) http://store.steampowered.com/app/440, Portal http://store.steampowered.com/app/400, and Portal 2 http://store.steampowered.com/app/620 -- in order to see the textures of the corresponding custom files. You may still be able to download the textures from these games from the internet without actually purchasing the game itself, however. All of that mess aside, Garry's Mod is definitely worth your $10, if not even more. This game will offer limitless entertainment to just about any age groups(but please no 8 year olds). You will have the world of physics at your fingertips if you purchase this game and that world will be worth everything you put into it. It offers you the freedom of using your imagination in order to do whatever the heck you want, when you want to do it, and all you have to know how to do to make that happen is -- well -- to know how to do it.
AdamRamsay;-;This game called Garry's Mod has Lots of amazing game modes like TTT and Deathrun Hope you buy it!
neo_child;-;With over 1000+ Hours (1418 as of this review [I even got the 1337 hour mark! :D]), I "HIGHLY" recommend this game, tons of replayability, games for days, communities to be in; Overall its an amazing purchase for what its worth. However a game like this does have its downsides, Its all minigames. Unless you want an immersive game to delve into, half of the time its in minigames. Sometimes also, communities are gone in a week. You join an amazing server and the next thing you know, its gone. But! This is only 30% of the whole game, I have spent many an hour to play various gamemodes which pop up frequently, if not everyday and each offer hundreds upon hundreds of fun, even more with a friend! You can even have a Roleplay server aka you roleplaying in Half-Life 2, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Fallout, and even more! Again, this game is a must have, its spectacular in everyway, even if there are some bad apples, but its a good game. NOTE : Do buy this as a bundle with CounterStrike: Source, it saves you a bunch of money. Also Half-Life 2, both episodes preferably.
Maxim-Xeno;-;I have over 3,500 hours in this game. I still haven't learned how to E2,E2 is a in-game coding service. So coding things inside something that's extensively coded so that you can modify the code to code things inside the something that is extensively coded. I have over 3,500 hours in this game. I still haven't played all the game modes. I have over 3,500 hours in this game. I'm a amazing shot and a even better stealther.(you can blame TTT for that) I have over 3,500 hours in this game. My creations include a mech,a huge ship,server-crashing bombs,drones,spaceships,tanks,helicopters,and planes. I have over 3,500 hours in this game. I still get called a noob by 11 year olds.
Rigby;-;I just got Gmod Yesterday and I have to say: Great job Garry! This game has everything you an want. It is very funny, it has a decent price and it's worth it! So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and buy it!!!
CSi. Adalyne;-;You would not be able to imagine the wide variety of emotions I feel while playing this game. In Garry's Mod, the tale starts out with you, Margaret, waking up in a strange city, not remembering what has happened in the past. The city seems quite empty and quiet despite the constant screams of pain coming from all corners of that area of torture, doom, and loneliness. Along the way, you help a man, Garry, who seems to be suffering. You agree to take him along with you, although you're unsure of what to do next. You both share a mutual agreement to leave the city. Along the way, you may get jumped by some thugs. Garry and Margaret share about themselves, in spite of Margaret not knowing much. Once Garry has been informed of her lost memories, he says he'll help her. Margaret slowly remembers as they venture parts of the game, inside and out of the city. She begins to wonder if she wants to remember anymore. The game has many fantastic twists. It'll make you feel very genuine emotions. The story and gameplay is spectacular. Nothing is too predictable, and nothing is too over-the-top ridiculous. Everything is so moving, and it portrays the growth of Garry and Margaret's relationship perfectly.
I am Axe;-;So uh this game is kinda cool, you can build stuff or kill people and that's kinda cool.
Gnome Child;-;Here is my Gmod Adventure: -Joins a Russian DarkRp server -Gets a police job -Randomly weapon checks a guy and finds half of the isis on his pockets -Shoots him 9 times in the head -Turns out that he is admin -Get's banned 9/10 too much isis -IGN
Pokeguy;-;This isn't just a game. This is whatever you want it to be. Want to attach 200 balloons to a rocket and blast it into a 20-foot tall headcrab? You can do that. Want to team up with your terrorist buddies to find a traitor or two? You can do that. Want to throw Sonic the Hedgehog at Buzz Lightyear with a shotgun? You can do that. Basically, this game is your imagination multiplied by watermelon. 10/10. Would buy again. Actually, I have bought it again. Twice.
HereTic;-;~2k hours solely playing singleplayers. 10/10.
Koala;-;If you like your ears do not play this game. Screaming kids made me deaf. 0/10
Sir Det Rape;-;Went on a Dark RP server to find a hobo running in the street throwing bugbait everywhere screaming "The world is coming to an end" and then people driving around in cars running people over. This game most definitely ruined my life.
Azzy;-;Wow, Purchased this game around a week ago I believe, I love"d" it until the kids came and Jesus are they annoying, mic spam , chat spam saying they're "gay" and swearing non-stop, delaying games and screaming and raging. Funny is they don't get banned, the people that get banned are the ones playing normally and not doing and of the things i mentioned.... wtf o.0. That isn't garrys mod but just ed up admins abusing their power. Game is ok sometimes could get annoying with people not following the rules and all the bans. i still think its a 9/10 game and should buy it imo. Its only 10.99 for me and thats a cheap price for an amazing game. Could get very boring by yourself without a mic but with friends it turns into the best game and could kill thousands of hours on it and wouldn't want to get off. 9/10 Play darkRP and raid an admins base if you have balls. Meow has banned you for rdming XD
Zyga;-;I love the ability to play in a game where everyone can make everything, theres no such thing as a playing wall in this game because someone will just make a new gamemode for you to play. (I wrote that christmas 2012 ^^ still true to this day ) Story: 10/10 (You make. YOUR OWN. Or play in someone else's. Always new.) Gameplay: 10/10 (Depends on the game, but that excels still) Presentation: 8/10 (Gold source. well... ok.) Soundtrack: X/10 (None default) Replayability: 9/10 (Gets boring sometimes but you'll always come back.)
MeltingMan234;-;Garry's Mod is a mod where you can mess around with models, maps, and can create almost anything. Sandbox is where you can explore maps from Valve games like Team Fortress 2 or some fan made ones found within the Workshop on Steam. I usualy play around in this mod a lot and brainstorming ideas to make Gmod Videos, which are very common on Youtube or on the fourms. Gmod videos are very similar to stop motion videos such as Nightmare Before Christmas, with a lot of practice, work, and a HUGE amount of patience, you can create smooth animation, which is what I have yet to accomplish. Tools are very handy for videos such as Easy Bodygroup which changes the different colors or styles of a model, Bone Merger is useful for TF2 items to properly weld things together, Face and Finger poser is what they are for, posing the facial expressions and finger gestures. Or if you get tired of single player, there is a lot of Multiplayer with tons of different mods. Deathrun is where you survive a series of traps, Murder is where the buystanders have to kill the murderer by collecting clues, Flood is more for advancd players where they build a boat out of junk, and have to take down other peoples boats in a flooded room, then you have the classic Prop Hunt where a group of people disguise themselves as props and the other team has to track them down. I have experienced some issues with Gmod, some of the textures still maintain that purple and black checkered color and some maps have errors and issues. You'll need to have Half Life 2, TF2, and Counter Strike: Source to have th maps and props appear, but sometimes that's not enough. I also have no idea if you can favorite random servers cause I have played some fun servers and the completely forgotten what they were. Managing the addons from downloading content from the Workshop can be a real hassle, it would be easy if you were ableto create folders to orginize your modles and props, like say I made a folder to stash all of my Sonic Modles into 1 folder. Another downside would have to be their website where most of the props and other things originated, nowadays they're all out dated and impossible to load into Gmod with all of this complicated file dragging and all this other stuff. But other than that, Gmod is fun to play around with and create random snapshots of characters and props. If they can make TF2, and Left 4 Dead 2 free to play, why not do the same for this one? Well than again there is some gory stuff and some sexual stuff that can be thrown into Gmod. So in other words, is it worth a buy? Yes it is, as long as you have most of the content that requires you to be able to play this properly.

Star_Hawk_;-;Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway. "Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm... _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more. _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore. _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds. _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want. _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10 Overall 8.5 Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

Valiantttt;-;Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

6u574v0 l337;-;This game is amazing to play with the friends Very gud 1000/10
ForgetfulCat;-;This game is simply amazing. Sure, it has great gameplay and many different gamemodes for players of all kinds. But it's even more than that. The community is simply amazing. The people who play this game are as varied as its gamemodes. Compared to triple A games, where everyone "parties up" and plays competitively, this game puts a whole new spin on the concept of gaming with others. Imagine you are in a room with three other players in game. You all have guns. In any other game, you would instantly shoot each other. Some people would rage quit; others would cuss and scream into the mic. This is not so with Garry's Mod. In this game, the people would talk to each other (either via text or mics) and create their own scenario that has nothing to do with the way the game is meant to be played. They would mess around, have some laughs, and make friends. It is no longer simply about the game objectives. It is COMMUNITY. It is about FRIENDSHIP. If nothing more, it is about LAUGHS. No matter what you look for in a game, this game has it all. If you want to be competitive, you can be (though I don't recommend it). If you want to laugh and make friends, this game is the absolute best in the industry. Garry's Mod, simply put, is COMMUNITY.
Zaber (out till the 19th);-;The ultimate physics sandbox game. Probably the best game of all time. I don't even know where to begin, just try the game yourself.
Berkin;-;Everything about this game is glorious. Not only does it give players the freedom to do whatever they want from both creative and objective standpoints, but it encourages people to be interested in programming and game development. It is easy to see how hugely it succeeds in this aspect, as its community creates an unfathomably massive amount of custom content, including entirely new gamemodes (Prop Hunt is my personal favorite). The potential this game has to inspire people to be imaginative is huge; there is nothing you can't do in it. I have spent countless hours building insane things with my friends and I think that has furthered my career in programming thanks to how fun it is to make your own mods. Thanks to Garry's Mod, I have made countless friends, and become a better developer. This is the best $10 you'll ever spend. Trust me.

Cotwa;-;For a game that will only run you $9.99, Garry's Mod is one of the most popular Steam games, and the best sandbox game, ever to be created in my opinion. The game has sold millions of copies, and trust me, I wouldn't think any game that's so cheap, money-wise, would sell that many. The main point of Garry's Mod is to build contraptions and make them work. These can range from cars to boats to trains to helicopters and a countless amount of things you can do. To build these you use props, simple models that were taken from existing games. Speaking of existing games, the other main idea is that you collect as many Valve games as you can so that you can use it's resources in the game. To start you off, you get quite a lot of stuff from Half Life 2, such as NPC's, weapons, models from the game and ragdolls. My personal favourite category is the HL2 Vehicles section, where you can spawn usually wrecked car bodies and try and bring them to life with the wheel tool and two thrusters on one side. Garry's Mod also has it's own range of pre-made models, such as jet planes, railways, trains, rollercoasters, and even has it's own mascot: G-Man. Sometimes building can be easy, other times it needs a little bit of perfecting. For example, to make sure a train doesn't go flying off a track you have to decrease the force of the thruster that makes it go forwards or backwards. If you're making a helicopter you might have to resort to using hoverballs, which can go ape if you're not careful. You would think that building a car is as simple as placing four wheels on a box and making sure the wheels turn the right way when you press a key on your numpad. Wrong. You have to add thrusters on both sides of the car if you want it to turn and not have too much force if you don't want it to drift. But it's fairly easy once you know how to do it. Besides Sandbox, there are also a plethora of other gamemodes. One or two of them have you live in a city, get a job, eat food etc. or it could be a simple deathmatch. Obviously I can't list every single gamemode that exists, so lets skip to the next part of this review. The graphics are amazing. The lighting is up to perfection and everything is just so detailed. The water deserves a real praise, it is absolutely beautiful. The player models are also perfectly detailed and everything is just perfect in general. Well done Garry, well done. The game was completely made to be multiplayer, but you can also go single-player if you want to. The community obviously varies depending on what gamemode you're playing. For example, sandbox players can be helpful and can make pretty cool stuff. DarkRP players can be a little out of order, otherwise they're generally ok. Overall, the online is A-OK. The game has completely realistic audio. All of the props have their own material, so for example wooden crates obviously sound like wood when they collide with something, or when they get hit. Glass props will shatter like glass, metal clangs when it collides. If you die, you hear a heart-monitor sound that decreases to a long beep. If you get killed by an explosive, you hear a high-pitched sound as if your hearing got damaged. When you're underwater, the sound is modified to fit exactly that. Even the voices of other players are changed. NPC's get voices too, though all of the HL2 humans call you Gordon since they think you're Dr. Freeman. I love how the zombies sound like, especially the Fast Zombie and the Manhacks. The audio is again up to perfection. The controls are really easy to handle. You can walk, run, sprint, crouch and jump. You can also fly around using the V key. This is called "noclip" and it makes you able to go through almost anything. Though strangely, bullets can still hit you so watch out. When you have a contraption going, such as a helicopter or car, you can control it like an RC toy with your numpad. Or you can hop in (if you added a seat) and can drive it. The handling of your own contraption depends on what you added and how you modified it. Other than that, everything is great. Being a game that can be expanded by the many Valve games out there, it obviously takes every resource from any Valve game you have in your Steam Library and allows you to use it to your taste. If you have Team Fortress 2, you can pose a Scout ragdoll in any way you want. Though some of Garry's Mod is original, such as having it's own models, otherwise it's a real resource user. With all the game-modes, maps, add-ons and various other stuff you can add to the game, this game shall never end up being defined with the word "old". Though sometimes you can end up not knowing what to build, but that's a different story entirely. It's guaranteed that you can play this game forever. Garry's Mod is the best sandbox ever created, as I said earlier. Most of it's features are tuned up to perfection and the game never gets old. I'm still quite new to this game and already I've joined communities about certain servers on the game. It's definitely a great game in all it's might. If you're a PC gamer, you have to at least try this game. Especially if you're on Steam. It's one of the most popular Steam games, and I would completely recommend it to every gamer I meet. I love this game so much. I can't see who wouldn't.
=[pG]= Crackerjack| Starscream;-;Garry's mod has something for everyone! With so many gamemodes, such as Roleplay, TTT, and just plain sandbox, you can't go wrong! There's something for everyone in Garry's mod. I highly recommend it. It's a fun game with so many possibilites.
Codez;-;Very silly game.
[DFS]Dr. Sauce: British Man;-;My review of Garry's Mod (Singleplayer only): What do I know about Garry's mod... well, it's a tool for posing, making screenshots and showing off screenshots which look to be processed through movie filters. Often, if using the right graphics card, a picture can look crisp, clean and even outperform Source Film Maker in terms of quality. However, there is one massive downfall that Garry's mod regularly faces, this downfall is its addons, not that the content is bad, a large majority is awesome to say the least. But, the real downfall is that there seems to be NO MEANS of accessing any content you have subscribed to on the workshop sometimes. That's what really makes it fall down MASSIVELY. As an example, you might be biding your time casually playing around in a different game when suddenly, WHAM! A bolt of pure inspiration hits you, you happen to have the skill and the addons to make your wildest dreams come true! But then, you load up Garry's Mod and check to see if all your mods are there... ...You see that it says "NO MODS FOUND!" it is more common to find your game unmodded due to errors regarding either the workshop or the game itself, and it's rather dull without the mods, as you have very limited resources to play with, even if it's a sandbox game. Truth is, the game is still confined to all the items within the Source engine, these mods allow you to completely bypass this reliance as long as you have the neccessary Source textures. So you're probably wondering... why the hell would someone buy a game that's so plain, boring and buggy? Well, let me give you an answer, the community. There are literally BILLIONS of mods for Garry's mod that exist as of this current moment in time, there is also a random peice of information that I happen to know and it's the following: At least one thing is submitted to the Garry's mod workshop every 0.5 seconds at least. This means that the workshop is still growing, even now whilst you are reading this. But that's not all that's on offer, you have the whole internet at your fingertips (trust me, google is your friend). If you are ready and willing to sift through all the bad stuff and find the huge goldmine of good stuff, it'll be incredibly enticing to buy Garry's mod. Overall, I'd say YES to reccommending this game, but I'd attempt to get it at a discounted price from somewhere... it's not bad, but it's not exactly value for money either.
Dodge999;-;Garry's Mod, a game where you kill water melons and bananas. Pretend to be friendly, and then shoot somebody in a face. You may think thats boring, thats only one game mode. This thing has game modes coming out every year or so, it's crazy I could log 1000 hours into this by a year If i wished to. It is addicting you start you can't stop, some game modes get repetetive you don't know anything about this game. Even the people with 1,000+ hours probably haven't explored all the games full possibilites. Also this gives you a new code LUA! MMM Gets annoying at times but you can learn it and be a master of creating servers adding items to your server. Theres DarkRP The 2nd most popular game mode, RolePlay were you can do anything you want in a very urban enviorment. 11/10 Chased somebody around a fruit stall with a knife.
On Vacation;-;The game where you can make combine with miniguns 10/10 mlgprogame
Pure_Noob;-;It is awesome with a ton of stuff to do and a lot of workshop items but i think i might have to much xD Besides that, TOTALLY worth the $10 they want in exchange for this cool game with... -RolePlay -Sandbox -Slender 8-12 pages -Trouble in Torrorist Town -Murder -Cinema -Horror maps And maaaaaaaaaaaaaany more :) When you get it it's a straight... uhhh.... you know.... ahh! you'll love it!
X|Based God Turtle;-;I only played a little, but it was fun.
James;-;Joined a sanbox game after 10 minutes of downloads. Build a rocket car to go as fast as possible for no reason. activate rockets to go as fast as possible. Twelve year old moderator comes up to me with a fence and says "That car is to loud" and procedes smacking me with said fence. I end up across map as he chases me with his fence. I continue my messing around with my car. * You have been banned from the server for to much noise* 10/10 would download for 10 minutes again.
[Ace] Reaper;-;This is a super creative game! I bet you can make a lot of awesome things. And it has so many mods you can download in the workshop. the 2 basic and funnest things they give you is sandbox which you can make so many things, and trouble in terrorist town is fun as well because you can be an a normal guy who gets weps and there is detective which you can search bodies to see how they died and who killed him. Buy this game for full price and on sale! This is full of FUN! I can play it for hours straight and not get tired of this game, Which I do spend a lot of time playing this awesome game!
-{.}- Doktor James;-;With it's mixture of gameplay and artistry, this game is fun for both the aspiring artist and the man who just wants to have fun as well. Although it can be a little much to take in at first, with all the tutorials, tools, and maps provided by the community, you'll get the hang of it in no-time, and will soon be creating your very own masterpieces. The amount of things you can achieve with this game are almost limitless, whether it be building a rocket ship, or posing a wacky picture, Gmod has something for everyone.
8Gaming;-;only good if you have friends and better if you do Youtube
Drift;-;xD. This is one funny potato.
DJ Pon-3 (Viny);-;There is only one way to play this game... and that is to download Gbombs and crash it.
I suck at video games.;-;And people tell you that Xbox Live is filled with kids... HA.

Appleorgasm;-;The sandbox game that is actually sandbox, and the only thing holding you back is your imagination. Although the game has gone to  with all the 7 year olds. :'(
Kassoul-VAC Banned;-;One of the best games I ever played , The mods are awesome and the gameplay is crazy :)
Cra0kalo;-;Well it's a mod Garry made.
[DB] Conman;-;Garry's Mod is just straight up fun. Garry's Mod takes everything from the great Half-Life franchise and gives you the power to do whatever you want with it. Wish to run over a lot of Headcrabs and Zombies with a jeep that have balloons attached to it? Done! Want to set up Ragdolls and props, then destory it all with all the weapons in your inventory? Sure! This game has no limits, and with the new Gmod 13 update, there is plenty of gamemodes to choose from to play in multiplayer, such as Trouble in Terriost Town, Prophunt, Zombie survival, DarkRP, HL2RP and of course the classic Sandbox gamemode, with plenty more! With new content being constantly released on the Steam Workshop made by users for Garry's Mod, it becomes endlessly fun with every click and turn of the mouse. Definetely a fun game for anyone interested to make some good memories, but remember to play the Half Life series first for maxium enjoyment!
Massif_Weeb;-;You can't truly be a steam player without having this game.
Bambaata;-;Garry sure does have a lot of time on his hands. garry/10
H2O Delirious;-;I love this game you should try it out- Delirious
~MooMoo Bluey Hooves~;-;One of the best games ever
Mendozacheers;-;What is everyone's favorite Source Sandbox game? While Garry's Mod of course! As the name suggests, Garry's Mod was orignially a mod, and still is - in some regards. The mod was originally created by Garry Newman with not much more help than the Source SDK. Once the mod reached a certain point of interest among the players, so did it over att Valve. Being that Valve is very good at taking mod-makers under their wings and helping them to reach it's full potential - for a cut of the cake of course. Therefore Valve naturally became the publisher of Garry's Mod, and the game could remain the rights and to accumulate profit. Profit! Unlike some other not-originally-valve-projects (Such as Counter-Strike, Portal and Left 4 Dead), Garry's Mod actually got to remain an indie game. Somewhere around here, Garry founded Facepunch Studios and released an actual game - Garry's Mod 10. This time they could charge money for the "mod", as valve was getting a share of the sales income. The game has always been pretty cheap and has been on steam sales at least a billion times. So everyone and their cats have this game, rightfully so. If you have other source games on your Steam account, you can link them and add some of it's content into Garry's Mod, giving even more stuff to balls around with. Garry's Mod is the perfect game if you want to kind of pretend to be a game designer and just PLAY around with the Source engine, which is an awesome engine for this I might add. Build your dream doll-house featuring all your favorite source characters, Tank, Gordon Freeman, Terrorist, Demoman, G-Man etc. Then blow them into pieces. Garry's Mod 11, a recent free update added even more stuff to the game. You can do endless stuff in this game, you might want to look up som tutorials or guides on how to use all the different tools and such. I never got too deep into Garry's Mod, I dipped my toes in the water and tried the basic stuff. Everything from just flooding the place with NPC, to building airborne vehicles. I am always amazed about the sheer amount you can do in this game, but I will probably never get there myself. I am hoping that this game will move on, live to see Source 2 and to get more stuff ported over to it. Everyone likes Sandbox games. You already have this game, so why are you still reading? Go play!
Irishbulletz;-;Garry's Mod is the best sandbox game that I have ever played. The game is filled with gamemodes, maps, weapons and gadgets, all made by the community. Installing new content is as easier than ever before with the Steam Workshop, find a mod you want and press a button to download! No hassle! You can do whatever you want in Garry's Mod. Want to build a car powered by thrusters that can fly? Go ahead. Want to roleplay in a city run by players? Sure, you can do that too. Don't like to do any of those things? Well, you can create your own gamemode, and map as you see fit. My personal favourite gamemode is Trouble in Terrorist Town "TTT" where players are chosen randomly to be an innocent, detective or a traitor. The detectives and innocents must find out who the traitors are before they kill everyone with the help of their gadgets. This gamemode is a blast with friends, and a great example of the shenanigans that occur in Garry's Mod. Garry's Mod is filled with practically unlimited possibilities, this game offers so much content that it is A STEAL for the price! If you don't already own this amazing game, I can't recommend it enough. A must have for any Steam library!
NAMELESS;-;I love Garry's Mod , Because it's a really fun co-op mode :D. There's different gameplay inside it such as Murder , Prop Hunt .. Death Run and ETC. I haven't got this for a long time O_O so , i don't know all of the gameplay , but only those i played is fun, With Nick and Mat in the Cinema :D it's just Great " I LOVE IT ! 8/10 !
King Eclipse;-;Hello, for anyone that doesn't have this gam.. I have 1500 hours in 1 gamemode.. get the ing game
I like your;-;A weird game, suitable with people that are looking for something novel
Wit_Huntybee;-;I got killed by a can. 10/10
smart person with dinos;-;Such fun. Very good. Wow. Buy now.
Julius;-;Gmod is a very fun game, that you can put an eternity of time into.
IamCoconut;-;Fun and adictive if you have someone to play with, but the community is full of small anoying kids who shout at their microphone at a 0,5cm distance. In any case, buy this game not for the community, but for the endless posibilities that await you in Gmod.
(LoD)Emmsi_Gaming;-;i played Bowling with Explosives... and then one of the pins killed me.. 10/10
mac'a'tac;-;10/10 would download  from servers again
Strange Fox;-;This game is Awesome
Eddy Leoshi;-;Best flying bathtub simulator ever 11/10
Clarke Griffin;-;Garry's Mod is the best game I've ever played! You meet heaps of awesome people, although not all of them are friendly and may be extremely douchey you can easily block/mute them or just leave the server. Theres alot of fun gamemodes like DarkRP, TTT, Murder (Popular ones) Then other less popular, but still fun ones that give variety such as Surf, BunnyHop, Sledbuild etc. It's a game that you'll see your friends having alot of hours on and if you buy it probably yourself ;) Last of all it's amazingly fun! P.S You won't care about the 'single player' sandbox
OGchan;-;So much fun with friends and it's really easy to makes friends with random people! Creativity to the MAX!
Booty Biologist;-;Got on the top of a skyscraper and shot my self in the head and then watched my body fall in slow motion as dear sister played in the backround 10/10 would suicide again
MudKip (LTscar117);-;wacky, crazy, and funny? can you ask for anything more? oh yeah, explosions and action is already included. but its a pain in the butt to get the texture packs for the game to work
Julius;-;Gmod is a very fun game, that you can put an eternity of time into.
QuirkY;-;This is a great and very fun game. It allows you to build what you want, without goals or achievements, by your self or with a group of friends in sandbox. I mainly play Trouble in Terrorist town, where one or more players are selected as traitors to hunt down the innocents and detectives, who are try to hunt them down. But there are many more game modes you will enjoy, like Murder, Prop Hunt, Zombie Survival and many more. Garry's Mod is definitely worth your money and time, so go get it now. Score - 9/10
Illusion;-;I wish I knew how to quit you.
Zavier;-;Sometimes life in the ghetto can be sad for me and my doggies. Sometime the bullies at school call me names like 'f@gg0t' and 'd1ck l1ck' and I say, "Why do you talk in 1337?". Then they throw me onto a puddle and they walk over me as if I was a carpet, or a really small bridge. But then I get to my home after almost getting mugged and go to my PC which was the only thing I got for Christmas from ages 5 to 11. And I like making the characters thin they look like cardboard it look nice.
LordYeex~;-;The most ultimate sandbox of all ultimate sandboxes. You can blow up melons with a nuclear bomb. You can download addons that'll make you a bag of doritos. Play with friends, play alone, play naked, play drunk, play with cheesedoodles on your bro, play with a mushroom on your toe, play with a hot potato in your banana... ok srsly idk why im writing this it doesn't make sense at all and its just a waste of time so what am i doing with my life EDIT #1: I wonder if i were drunk writing this... potato
Foxy;-;Used a watermelon to murder a Vocaloid in cold, pixel blood. 11/10
2ndLt Sir Metalic [8thVA];-;Get this game unless you have no balls.
B4XT3R;-;Created by Garry Jewman and his team of technologically-impaired slaves, this completely bug-free ragdoll poser offers much more than just that - providing the user with the ability to also change the ragdolls' facial expressions and manipulate them in sexually suggestive ways using the limitless library of tools. This mod also features a large variety of wonderful third-party gamemodes such as DarkRP, and is known for having a kind, loving and mature fanbase that will greet you with open arms and respect you no matter how old you are. Insanely overpriced and absolute garbage; 10/10.
IamCoconut;-;Fun and adictive if you have someone to play with, but the community is full of small anoying kids who shout at their microphone at a 0,5cm distance. In any case, buy this game not for the community, but for the endless posibilities that await you in Gmod.
Kiwi;-;I was called a kid and a  by multiple 10 year olds 11/10 would play again
Doctor \\ Who;-;This game is the best game you could ever get. It WILL be the best $10 you ever spent. It has so many fun and interesting game modes that'll keep you hooked for hundreds of hours. I have 1,575 hours, currently. Get it. Nao. ;3
DragoFlyrr;-;Do you enjoy sticking balloons to every conceivable surface? Do you enjoy attaching Hatsune Miku to a rocket, and attaching said rocket to an oversized bust of Claptrap? If you know any of these references or really ing like balloons, you should probably invest a little bit of your money into what seems to be the craziest sandbox game ever created.
Meyers;-;Has its moments
Shara;-;logic. You are a couch. A couch with wheels on it.
Behraka;-;"We give you the tools and leave you to play.." I'm not even sure where to begin with this game. It's 2014, the Youtube is full of your silly or memorable Gmod moments and SFM-crafted movies, it has become a phenomenon on the internet AND not to mention how much of a reliable platform it is for talented programmers and scripters to try out experimentations. It's a ridiculously-enriched game with endless possibilities. Newcomers can either create their own insane world or hop on one of the many gamemodes they find on the internet and enjoy their time. It's addictive, user-friendly, simple for the beginners and just what the game nerds need to make a difference. Although the gaming community is marred by immaturity, Gmod's workshop showcases the presence of an ever-active "user-contribution" factor. While sandbox gaming has emerged as being highly popular in the last two decades, few games falling under the "physics sandbox" category can match the open-ness of Gmod.
The Terminator;-;Its fun. Buy it.
Alia;-;Overall, This Game (Garrys Mod) Is Fun And Exiting For All Ages. One Of The Best Game Modes In My Opinon Is, Trouble In Terriost Town, Also Known As TTT. There Are So Many Game Modes On Garrys Mod And They're All Uniqe In Their Own Way. For Me, The Least Fun Is Sandbox But I Reccomend TTT.
Strange Fox;-;This game is Awesome
(LoD)Emmsi_Gaming;-;i played Bowling with Explosives... and then one of the pins killed me.. 10/10
mac'a'tac;-;10/10 would download  from servers again
[DTF2] kernel32.dll;-;I recommend this game, you can build stuff, play around with npc, ragdolls. Play with addons, and do alot of things you can do in Gmod. I just spend months to play. Also it's very fun, i play this game with my friend all time. 12/10.
Your Right Buttcheek;-;More people know me as a buttcheek than my real name now. I am no longer human. Thanks, GMod. You should totally get this game because it's pretty sick, and I never got tired of it. There are tons of gamemodes to try out, and you meet new people every day too. It's a great game for fun, socializing, and for killing anything you want! also, don't ask where your left buttcheek is. please. (and don't be an irritating fanboy/gril that claims he/she is the one and only left buttcheek)
CAPTAIN AUTISMO;-;Made a giant driveable  with WireMod. 8/8
Nik (   );-;I highly recommend this game! It is a amazing sandbox experience. You can download addons like maps,snpcs,weapons and more! There a a lot of amazing addon authors like Cpt.Hazama, Vrejgaming and Geneworm. As I said I highly recommend this game!
~=^[(O){d_b}(O)]^=~;-;A really fun game if you have a creative mind. You can create and build to your hearts content. There is a lot of content and option in the game to play around with so that you will never get board. The combinations to what you can build and play with are endless. The game uses physics which is entertaining when playing with friends and killing the AI that you spawn in the game. The graphics are crisp and great to look at. People can get addicted to this game rather quickly when you get the hang of everything this game has to offer. The online portion of this game is very active and fun to play around with friends. There is a single player mode were you can get used to building so that you don't look weird when playing with friends online. This game is highly recommended for the great gameplay and endless possibilities to use your mind and creative side. Build, create, and enjoy the mind for its imagination.
[PG] RandoM;-;If you don't have the game yet. Get it. It's worth the money.
MasterLeon546;-;This game is a true masterpiece, its a great game if you have a great mind creating objects and gadgets. There are many reasons why this game is soo good, 1)This game have the Workshop so you can download maps,props from other games, weapons, tools etc.... 2)This game have multiplayer so you can have fun with other players in the sandbox. 3)This game have a lot of fun gamemodes: like Trouble at Terrorist Town, minigames, Jailbreak, DarkRP And a lot more... I hope i helped you guys with this review for making you buying it!
zoot007;-;This game is very fun and cool?
black boys = best zoo keepers;-;one of the worst games ever released, now made even worse by the fact Garry is appearently out sourcing all dev work to India.
Toxic Termite;-;play this too
MistarRag;-;Killed my friends with a rainbow rocket 69/10
Skampus;-;I stole a fork in a server and everyone shot and killed me
Hoff;-;Really fun all around. From a developer's standpoint, lua (a scripting language) is really flexible. Sucks that garry ripped code from jbmod though
-[MPS] (DxD) Rias Gremory (O4F)-;-;An amazing game. Truly the first game with infinite free DLC. With millions of maps and plenty of gamemodes, Its a win. And it's very cheap for what it has to offer, best game i ever bought on steam ez money ez lyfe
[QE] Jervi McServi;-;It is amazing if you go on the right server! I go on the server 'Questionable Ethics TT [UK]'. I started at about End of October 2014, got promoted to Op end of December 2014. Questionable is the only server I play on, I have tried a few others but they don't function the same as QE. 8/8 would d8
Bonnie Bunny;-;Really awesome game! ^-^
Barcode;-;Fun game, different types of modes. Great to play with friends or anyone in particular!
Dtrayn;-;This game is so fun. you can never be bored of playing Gmod. Theres allways something fun to play
Caetho;-;It's a good game where you can create an enormous ammount of things. I mainly use it for Sandbox games and I can't get enough of making all kinds of things in there.
mayLa;-;An amazing game. It's games inside of a single engine is what it seems like. Similar to how Minecraft servers work.
daker94;-;This game I highly recommend there be enough to entertain there is a lot of game servers. After installing WIREMOD in game mode SANDBOX game gets a lot more opportunities to have fun. But judge for yourself..... daker94
yola;-;Garry's Mud Characters: In this game you play as a bank robber named Garry Heegan. Sheedan's hobbies include ing prostitues, being a , eating crackers, and licking prostitues. You are joined by Miss Heegan and Ms. Heegan. Don't forget Mrs. Heegan. Now the Heegan family are broke and they  for a living and judging from what I said earlier I lied this game is an incest porn game. Gameplay: The gameplay is amazing with top-notch mechanics. Definitely the epitimy of elegant design. In the game, you play as three midgets named garry, 's, and mud. I would like to point out that the devs of the game mispelled mud. it's nut mod. it's mud. So anyway, together you have sex. The reason it's called garry's mud is cuz they have a threesome and while of sex parts are usually 5-7 minutes long dis one is 6-7 1/2 minutes so it's longer so they made it the title cuz u kknow logic. Soundtrack: I love the soundtrack of this game I mean that one song! That song it went like boommm bombmbombommmmmm bommmm bobmmmmmmm wubwubwuwb boommmmmm and damn it wus like my jam yo Hummus: Hummus is cool might as well have it's own section up here. Overall, Dead Or Alive Volleyball was a great game. 9 ronald reagans out of 7 would poop again
Pictures of This Frog;-;RDM RDM! @admin! SCREAMING ON THE MICROHPONE. GET ON THE GROUND NOW. THAT'S FAIL RP. Stop breaking my ! Terrible videos. Kicked when the admin puts on terrible videos. vote skip 1/2. IGN 9.5/10 Solid Shill
Jihadi Jordan;-;This is one of a kind game. It's so unique .. unlike other games , which speaking of they have like a point and it's gets kinda boring after a while of playing those games but Garry's Mod is just a whole different story. So let's begin with the things you can do with this game: Tons of Mods Such as. TTT : It's so Fun, Unqiue Idea , and it's really amazing made out of a really simple idea which you can still play for hours and you won't get bored. Prop Hunt : It's like hide and seek but for adults !! It's amazing .. it might get boring but you'll laugh your  off while playing this smexy mod. Stop it slender : Not so much of a famous mod but it's scary . the best of it while playing with friends which also shows that garry's mod can be used in such different genres of mods and games. Murder : Another idea like TTT , but this one i didn't like much but it's still fantastic. Normal Sandbox : This one is the original gmod , do what ever the hell you want for the sake of lulz. Sled Build : It's also great and quite unique , making your own ideas for a sled become true .. all you need is just to think xD. RolePlay : I don't like much but it's great .. this mod is used in other games but the best in gmod. JailBreak : not so many servers or players playing this but it's unique and it's also in another games .. but it's no the best gameplay in gmod. So ... This game garry's is the best you can buy for 10$ I totally recommend it . It's So fun :D.
rare pepe;-;If you don't have this game then I know exactly what you're doing with your life. Actually living it.
Nomad;-;Good game. U can make hamsters fly out of toasters like its ur grandpappys birthday if u want. Is there more than ttt in this game? Nobody knows
Jessawyn <3;-;After 325 + hours playing this game...I can honestly say that I've never had more fun with a game in my entire life. I love this game to pieces. Not to mention the awesome people you meet in game. Unless you're completely anti-social, it's impossible not to make new, amazing friends while playing. <3
Romero;-;This game is great if you have a fantastic imagination. Sadly, I don't.
cs go sucks lol cod is better;-;i threw a table at a 6 year old and got perma banned
Rawr the Snarly Dragon;-;Too source-y

The Network;-;wow this game is awesome. infinite possibilties and tons of game modes to kill time with 10/10
The Xenomorph Warrior;-;This game is very fun, you can do almost anything like building, playing with your friends, making silly faces on your friends, or npcs! Best game ever. 100/10
Coverop;-;Is It worth it? Yes and No. Yes. You can check tons-of-stuff that community made (in 95%) for free. No. Game is buggy. Updates made by Garry, changed the quality of this game on worse. Trust me. It's up to you.
Stunner Dyrion;-;Amazing game, it is perfect for anyone! Hundreds of game modes for tons of fun. Zombie Survival for the serious people and Sandbox for the humorous.
Inspector Heavy;-;Its awesome to make Stop Motion videos on youtube :D
BrunOSly the Silly racoon;-;this game is super fun... it has more than 20 modes (i think more than 50 even) also there is many modifications to use, but the fun part is the multiplayer,if you have an friend go play with him, if you dont find an good server so you can play with randoms, even make friends, there is really many gamemodes, like; prop hunt, murder,zombies,and muuuch more..
TubelessMusic;-;Its LIke Minecraft, Its like anything u can imagine. You can create an House, An Base , An Movie , And Many more which inspire your creations!
Cyanide goes kek;-;A brilliant sandbox game,Garry's Mod is where your dream of being able to build,battle and drive anything comes true. Want to pose ragdolls?Got it. Want to drive an airboat on water?Yeah,got that too... Want to drive an airboat on land?Snow?Sand?Yes,it's in. Want to upload porn easily?Yep,that's in as well. Want to fight an army of sinks?GOT IT. Want to *insert random  verb here*? Yes,that's in too.Yeah,in.Yeah,it's got it.IT'S GOT EVERYTHING,ALRIGHT. Well,I do hope you enjoy this game full of  statues,mildly unpleasant deaths and rediculous sprays if you do get this.I couldn't write anything useful because *insert unrealistic,crazy and sick verb here*. EDIT:I left the game,probably for good. thxbai
Celestial Envoy;-;Garry's Mod is one of those games you look at and think: "Wow, this is really stupid", but then you buy it, and you exchange it for your soul. This game is addicting, mainly the multiplayer portions, where you have quite a few minigames, each you'll invest about a week of gametime into, or more or less, depending on your taste in games. Even if you dislike all of the games somehow, you can create your own mod or map using the sandbox on either single player or multiplayer. This game gives you everything you might want to do in general terms, and the only negativity you may recieve may come from unfortunate minor glitches or perhaps being in a messy server. Otherwise, buckle up and have fun!
Xorpik;-;Like building games? Get Garry's Mod. Like Roleplaying games? Get Garry's Mod. Like Zombie survival games? Get Garry's Mod. Like First-person shooters? Get Garry's Mod. Like Racing games? Get Garry's Mod. Like massive NPC wars? Get Garry's Mod. Like murder mysteries? Get Garry's Mod. Like obstacle courses? Get Garry's Mod. Like hide and seek? Get Garry's Mod. Like hillarious physics? Get Garry's Mod. Like video games? Get Garry's Mod.
Rogue Cheney [Away on Holiday];-;If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob a bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.
Hans;-;i wish i had more time to try this game out altered roleplay is the best community ever tho
Star_Hawk_;-;Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway. "Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm... _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more. _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore. _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds. _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want. _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10 Overall 8.5 Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

Valiantttt;-;Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.
Hoffa;-;You don't log 6000+ hours in a bad game if you get what I mean. http://youtube.com/Hoffa1337
FB||Gillan_Greenleaf;-;When I first bought this, my friend said "not a game, bro." He was right. It's not a game. It is your world. Do with it what you wish.
Shark Bait;-;You can spawn watermelons. 10/10
orane;-;An amazing game. Truly the first game with infinite free DLC. With millions of maps and plenty of gamemodes, Its a win.
Smallfearfire;-;> A magnificent game that covers a wide range of interests, whether you enjoy being creative and building things, want to have fun, or simply want to eradicate all of your friends/foes and do the chimichanga in their entrails. Dozens of diverse game modes gives variety to what you do, so you will not find yourself uninterested. > Unlike most games, Garry's Mod is not all about pointing guns at others and pulling the trigger! (Though if that is what you find yourself enjoying, it is indeed something you can do.) You may create machines to demolish others' hopes and accomplishments, or the players themselves instead! If you are not the destructive type, building things to assist others is an option as well. But hearken- the game is not all about creating and destroying, though it is an ultimate sandbox. The opportunity to watch videos, push buttons, create art, fool around, and many more fascinating activites-- such as staring at a wall-- are offered. > Posing ragdolls and props to create scenes/pictures is another activity available with this game, and thanks to Steam Workshop and Garrysmod.org, you may download custom models to bring more choices to what you make! If you don't like being limited to Team Fortress 2, Counter Strike, and Half Life models you may download player-made models from other games as well. > This game is a must-have, great for people of all ages/interests that will indubitably captivate you and is easy to play for hours on end.
BeanieBro2522;-;Gmod is amazing in so many ways, words cant begin to describe how amazing it is. i highly recomend this to every gamer.
Pugsicle;-;Seriously a fun game! My friends and I spend many hours playing this game on one of the many servers that this game offers plus just by our selves! Defintally a must buy
Eagle;-;Brilliant work of art
Glover;-;I'D POOP ON THIS GAME IF I COULD.
BRUXXUS;-;This game has consumed my life
Mr. Ownage;-;I'm still pretty new to this game, but based on what I've seen so far it's terrible
Vacation 16th. - 23rd.;-;This game is ing pay2win! You need good PC for high quality screenshots..... volvo plz nurf dis
Mister Brick;-;This game is life. People playing with things other people made. Unbound creativity. And all sorts of dumb things to do. Love it.
Sweety Ashley;-;A game with lots of variety within, you can do whatever you want!
Green Power Inc.;-;You can make movie with this game.
[EquS] NurseLLuna;-;Its a very fun game to play,theres like different kind of stuff in it like prop hunt,Murder,TTT,and other amazing games
Ethan.;-;if you like sucking  for a living then buy this game
Artful Dodger;-;Good game, it's just that majority of the community is douchey. Although this is just my experience.
[SC]AAron;-;The best ever that was ever best x 10 and two steps to the left and you still cant put this down!
alfie;-;Garry's mod just isn't cool anymore. It was unique, special, but its steam simply ran out. The most important reason is the now incredibly outdated source engine. Everyone who creates content like models and maps is moving onto new engines. This could be neglected when source was 5-6 years old, but now the very core on which the engine is based on is 10 years old and severely limited, not to mention ugly. Thats relatively speaking, of course. Furthermore, the base content is also about 10 years old and I for one am sick and tired of it. Yet any attempt to use other content fails naturally because of large download sizes and horribly low percentages of people who own for instance episode 2, let alone left 4 dead. Finally, gmod wasnt popular because of sandbox but because of other gamemodes. The people who once made gamemodes for gmod (because it was relatively easy to do so) are now making standalone games for new engines like unreal and unity that make the process dead easy compared to engines about 5 years ago and are amassing huge communities too. There were always many kids playing gmod, but it is the old guard that simply moved on. Its only natural because gmods limits have been reached. There can be new ideas, sure, but most avenues have already been explored and seen. It was a nice ride and we still can hope for a couple of years of stagnation. But in the end like all good but old games gmod will be played by about 100 or so loyal fans living in the past.
Captain;-;asshurt admins and stupid custom servers i've wasted too much of my time with this garbage 11/10
Finn;-;o
StickyWicket;-;yeah... i played it for a little while... its pretty good
Doctor Sheeps;-;This game is plain amazing, I can spend hours a day just messing around with friends and having fun. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions. Whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't even exist. You can even roleplay as a drug dealer, gang member, or almost anything you can imagine. This game has my vote of approval.
=LAS= Le Awesome Nick;-;Gmod isn't like most games, theres no goal to achieve or a quest to follow, it consist of complete fun, if you and your good friends get together on a server, then you could spend hours playing non-stop and have fun the whole time, it is completly mod-friendly and you can do just about anything. You'd expect a game like this to cost atleast $20, but its $10 dollars, and thats assuming it isn't on sale, which is usually $2.49.
Michael DeJera;-;So eh... yeah this game is good, there's some mods (If you whant to call them that) that I can recommend City Rp is good, Allthough the PD are OP jerkoffs, and you wont trust anyone. Zombie survival is good, allthought beeing the first zombie or beeing the first to die is pretty boring, 1942 Rp is good, ppl will lt you do your think unless you walks in to a KoS restricted area. Dark Rp, Havet figured out why I cant make Casino machines even though Im a casino owner eeh..lets see... oh yes! The vietnam war, Pretty nice (same damn map all the time as far as I know) Zworld Afterlife is good, reminds most of DayZ where you have to salvage and and craft your stuff. (be wary of players) Im forgeting something... *snaps fingers* (x3) stopitslender is good dont play it very much. *(Ey, I run head first with a assault rifle in City Rp running from the cops, so dont call me a coward)* Jailbreak is fun to some extense, but the kid warrans are make or break. I hope you "like" this recommendation and gives all mentions above a try. Hey, I had to put up with  music from next door while doing this, So i deserve some credits. *hint* The list above is not ranked after my favorite list.
Slenderp;-;Sometimes, I dream about cheese. 11/10
Ludicrosite;-;Guess what? You can spawn bananas. Yeah thats right,bananas. If you like bananas,get this game. It's full of bananas. 100/10
ownosourus;-;This is an extremely fun sandbox with no limits as to what you can do with it. It's various mods go anywhere from giant theatre for sharing your favorite YouTube videos, Competitions for building the best boat, Fortwars, Space environment building and roleplaying, And many more awesome mods.Garry's Mod is basically Google Sketch-up running on a Source Engine. You can mount almost ALL of your Source games, and create things to share on the Steam Workshop.Garry's Mod is a cheap, fun and enjoyable experience.
Kirigaya Kazuto;-;Great buy and a low price, i dont know whats holding you back from getting this vast mod for halflife 2. GET IT! Extensive replayability and great with friends and hundreds of gamemodes to explore. enjoy
Super-Lars;-;The Darkrp gamemode is best game ever, I have used over 200+ hours on that gamemode and it keeps getting funnier!
d.blazevski;-;Get it, end of story...........
Bear Grylls;-;Best game evar you should buy this game because you can spawn watermelons :D 10/10
[Spectres] Darius;-;Garry's Mod takes all the characters, effects and props out of all your favorite Source Engine games (such as Counter Strike, Half Life, Portal and many more) , and gives you the tools you may need to make whatever you want. You can weld, rope, pulley, attach a turret and a few thrusters to a chair and fly around shooting at the world aimlessly, with a downloaded Iron Man sNPC shooting you with a pistol. If you think your current games' content isn't enough, you have over 200,000 addons to choose from in the Steam Workshop, adding new tools, weapons, characters, maps and gamemodes. Garry's Mod isn't just a game, it's a strong base for you to build on. Anything you can dream becomes possible in Garry's Mod. Whether that dream is a nightmare is up to you Incredible. Recommended 10/10
Adder;-;This game. Ohhh this game. Literally my favorite game ever. I have almost 2000 hours into this game. By far the best game I have played. I have gotten way over the $25 worth of it. I would recommend this game to anyone. No matter what genre you normally play. This game made me have no life. Garrys mod is love, garrys mod is life.
MineWorst;-;Its a very nice game to play with your friends :)
Sir Mentlegen;-;Well, If your looking for something to do at anytime, Garry's Mod will surely entertain you. A game where the sky is the limit! (Literally, it gliches when you go through the sky, xD)
gNatFreak;-;Pro: It's like a game based on randomness! There are many gametypes for this game. Con: Best if you have CSS + Orange Box + additional mods from gmod.org (or was it .com?)
god damnit i shot the wind again;-;Probably the best sandbox physics game I've played, and it has an extremely active community so you can expect constant (and fun) mods to play around with. My favorite mods as of current has to be the Trouble in Terrorist Town mod and the Firearms: Source 2.0 mod. I also enjoy Prophunt and messing around with NPCs. The only downfall to the game is that not only do the mods take up a lot of valuable harddrive space, but playing singleplayer gets lonely very fast. I would recommend this to all my friends, it's a really nice game. 8/10
Hans Grosse;-;Honestly, it's about time I make a review for this. This is a sandbox game like no other. You can create pretty much anything you could possibly imagine, pose ragdolls, and.. well.. there's just so much! There are thousands upon thousands of addons available on the Workshop to customize your experience in the game, from ragdolls to models to weapons to multiplayer mods, and even more addons that may not be in the Workshop. Most of the time I've invested into this game was from making screenshots, which I enjoy doing, and continue to do. Others may do the same, or build contraptions, play multiplayer, or just plain messing around. Get this game, download whatever you desire, and let your imagination roam free. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.
Alcoholic Emily;-;Really Good Game 10 times better with friends i love murder and prop hunt :)
Dan_[Killing Nignogs in Spain];-;Best Sandbox game in EXISTANCE!!!
[RH]Xeria_;-;Must get this game. Its the best and the funniest aswell :D
P;-;This game is most creative game.
Tip Tip Fedora;-;Garry's Mod, where to start? Oh yeah, ITS AMAZING! Playing privatly with friends is as good as playing with randoms in public! Only $10s. If you don't want errors and missing textures, Counterstrike Source will be a good investment! Takes them all away 4 an extra $15 more! It has the word, "mod" in it and surely does it have a lot of them! So many fun mods from twerking to spiderman guns! A must buy and if you must, wait for it's sale! $2.50! They must be out of their minds! Final Verdict: Do I recommend this game, YES! Anyone who isn't sure if you should spare their time on this, it is very addictive and is the best mod 4 HALF-LIFE 2. Ive invested a 260+ hours on it and you should too!
Jamal Shumpert;-;this is a very good first person ego shooter. they killstreaks are pretty good this time. no spawnkilling. hi.
Flute;-;You can kill people with melons. 10/10
Well, you're not wrong.;-;pretty good, doesn't involve anyone called "Garry" which  me right off but i guess its alright. Clocked a few hours in and its safe to say it involves some nice little features like Alyx Vance's boobs
P;-;This game is most creative game.

TheBravePieceOfToast;-;it is awesome! It is good game if you like playing with friends or just being creative and making things! Or if you are like me and you just want to have fun and screw around! Then this is the game for you!
John Brown;-;Garrys Mod is an exellent game, it provides a lot of fun gamemodes that you can play with your friends.
GearBoy;-;It's ok
Stephen;-;I dont think a person could write a novel of a review and get this game across to a person. So I will just say this; my son spawned in a bathtub and it hit us. This bathtub needed wheels and maybe a thruster pack. So we each built one of these racetubs and did a drag race on a drag track we had made filled with people we spawned in. The limits of this game are only that limits you put on it.
Emre;-;Hmm, garry's mod to start off is a unique game. Like a game that doesnt need even a bit of mods, like why do u need mods if the whole game is like a huge mod xD. It is alot of fun just to play sandbox alone spawning tons of zombies then droping a 10x10 concrete block on them . And especially playing something like prop hunt with friends via skype, the laughs and giggles xD , priceless... The only bad thing is the downloading, every server requires some specific file to be downloaded , but if u chose like 2,3 servers for your favourite game moods , u can play them later without downloading all the stuff again ! 9/10 from me :D
Jesse pinkman;-;i love it, i will admit i joined just for ttt or trouble in little terroist town, but after i explored the bottomless of other features i just feel in love with it
Get_Jinx_(League_:3);-;Garrys mod is an awesome game. It have many gamemodes to play. I had garrys mod for almost a year now and it is still fun to play with friends and other online people. :)
Flute;-;You can kill people with melons. 10/10
A Golf Club;-;I fail to see the logic in why you have to read this review to know how limitless this game is If a game doesn't have limits then therefore it would be impossible for it not to appeal to anyone I'm not some extremist with over 1000 hours, but I know a great game when I see one Is this even a game? It's like an empire I swear I don't even know how to explain it It's just so massive and endless... it's also really silly sometimes... and it's always super fun I'm obsessed with the concept, even if my playtime seems to disagree. Just trust me. I'm fairly certain that it would be impossible to regret buying this game. :)
Johnny Bravo;-;Sand box where the only boredom comes from lack of imagination
Duncan Reeves (dA: FosterBonnie);-;This so called Garry's Mod was immensively got popular so fast that everyone (well also kids) wanted to play it. But I felt something different after when i got GMod 13 in a TF2 Competition "Get the most damage than any player while fighting the boss that doesn't die" Here's my opinions so far Positive Opinions: Screenshots: What are you waiting for? go grab some  in Workshop, read guides about making good screenshots in Singleplayer and, loss your motivation xD. Well, I was making screenshots about a year or some months when I got GMod, and so far 1/3 of my planned screenshots have lost motivation or I just got bored. There's more than just making screenies and . Videos: Remember kitty0706 and Dasboschitt? they make GMod videos a long time now and I'm still impressed of their videos. Oh and ummm making videos in GMod may take less time than making a long  video in SFM. If you want to make videos, grab any video maker you want, create scenes, put special effects like the MICHAEL BAY EXPLOSIONS ALL OVER DA VIDEOOOO, but dont make them out of place. Gamemodes: Yep, if GMod has only Sandbox, then it would be pointless. But since the users just want to mess up lua to make one good- gamemode, it will take motivation and time to do those . But not all Gamemodes are good, some were just awfully made bad. If you choose wisely which gamemode you want to play, then it's your own choice, do it. Murder: My favorite gamemode, focuses on finding out who is the Murderer and filled with paranoia and tense, feeling that you would be suprised-stabbed by the murderer. Unlike TTT where you shoot randomly, you have a 1/3 chance of having a gun or being the murderer. And the Murderer is fun and requires stealth to be alive. Lure the others then stab em with the knife. If you have the gun as Bystander, shoot it's legs, shoot it's face, shoot it's arm. He will die instantly. Negative Opinions: DarkRP and TTT: The most absolute iest gamemodes ever made. While they got popular SO ING FAST, that kids and minges will tend to ruin the fun out of it. Hell, imagine 12 Gangsters raiding the PD without a mob boss, they're like playing CoD: Source. Heh, now for TTT: While better than DarkRP itself and the good concept. Some players will just RDM to know who's the traitor, then if one innocent kills the traitor, another innocent kills the guy who killed the traitor. Wasen't that obvious? Minges: Yep, Minges are a common species of the GMod World, mostly kids and angry idiots who want to play GMod his own way instead of playing the game that the server wants. Mainly in Online Sandbox, TTT and DarkRP. Also they have the fact that they will not stop until they say "You stop" because they're butthurt and they don't even know how to play. Useless  in Workshop: Nearly 90% of the stuff is almost useless and stolen from the original creators, while 10% if it is good stuff. The 90% of it was useless dupes, saves and stolen addons. If you want to get the good stuff, then don't get the useless stuff. These are my opinions about GMod, but I will still recommend this because I love making screenies and hanging out with other players. But my rating wouldn't make you happy, here it is: PROS You can do what you want in Sandbox Good for making videos that you want less time 2/3 Gamemodes are almost good CONS Workshop is now invaded by useless and stolen stuff Kids and Minges tend to ruin the fun DarkRP killed the game Requires a another source game for extra content OVERALL SCORE: 78/100
Korjuda;-;What Cant Be Said About This Amazing Game With Its Cult Status As One Of The Best Sandbox EVAH!!. Its The Perfect Tool For Creating What Ever Your Sick Little Twisted Mind's Can Think Of. From Gmod Animations Like I Do. To Epic Servers Like E.G. 1942 Rp. Prop Hunt. Gmod Tower. It Is One Of My Fav Games I Will Ever Play. Its Amazing Addons Make It One Hell Of A Game And The Replay Value Is THROUGH TEH ROOF :3 BUY IT BUT IT BUY IT BUY IT
MC5077;-;This is a really fun game and if you like creating things this is the game for you I rate this game
Clud;-;Nice Sandbox
FuzzSpastic;-;Killed 2 people on darkrp when the sign of laws bounced of wall in a terror spin. 10/10 would kill again.
|TGA| Gaming Amoeba;-;I love this game it's so fun and you can do just about anything you can think of. Not to mention some of the awesome people you can meet through-out the communtiy.
Crazy Frank;-;One day I bought this because it was on sale for about 2.99. I didn't think much of it but then I started playing. I couldn't believe how addicting it was. I started losing sleep and skipping meals. It started to show on my physical health. My family started bugging me about it and even considered putting me into a rehabilitation center. Let's just say they won't be bugging me anymore. But now I dont have the funds to maintain an internet connection. I've sold everything I have just to play. I can't even go to starbucks and use their wifi because I sold my clothes and apparently they dont accept nudity. So basically I'm writing this review from my phone on top of a bridge. My life isn't worth it without this game. Yet it seems to have ruined my life. Goodbye world.
t0rtle;-;Killed by a chair. 11/10
Raymond;-;Garry's Mod Review - Raymond k. Turcotte ahh, Garry's mod. There's so many different Possibilities of fun, it's endless! Unfortuatly there is no real story line to it. Good thing it's a Sandbox game, right? In this game you have freedom, somehting you don't have in an ordinary game. I think that's what makes this game so popular. Even when you get fed up with the usuall item in the game, you could always download Add ons to make the game feel like new again! I Recommend this game!
Starbucks;-;This game is perfect. That's all I have to say.
Bub;-;This Is a REALLY Good Game. It Started Out as a MOD for Half Life 2, But Now Is a Stand Alone Game. Funny, Fun, Creative, And Multiplayer. GET IT NOW!
Paul Blart dorito cop;-;Great sandbox game with many gamemodes, the only problem is the performance. Got a slow PC? Enjoy having low framerates on popular servers. Also I still miss Garry's Mod 12, Garry needs to work on Garry's Mod instead of Rust if he doesn't make the game even more worse.
Sebb;-;This game is amazing, countless hours of fun and hundreds of gametypes, addons and extensions. For those who enjoy sandbox , roleplay and creativity this game is one of the best you can get. This is game worth the money.
kmo^;-;I like trouble in terrorist town becuz i rdm everyone
sacke;-;This is a great sandbox game, however it is much more than just a sandbox. There are thousands of multiplayer servers spanning different game modes, including DarkRP, Zombie Surival, and Parkour (DON'T FORGET TTT). The singleplayer sandbox servers are a great way to let out your creativity, (besides Source Film Marker, of course) allowing you to make artwork, or videos / movies if you wish. All the user-generated content in the Workshop is MOSTLY good. Another good thing about the UGC is that you can download it into your game via subscribing them. If you are considering on buying it, I strongly suggest that you do! (TIP: As with most other non-free to play games, I suggest that you buy this game during the Summer Steam Sale or Steam Holiday Sale.) More recently, I've found this game to be great for making posters as well, but most people would just SFM for that. However, graphics modifications created by users can increase the quality of Garry's Mod screenshots, and even help you create SFM-esque art. 10/10 Highly recommended for when you've some cash.
president sharkskull;-;this game is great although i dont know why no-one noticed Half Life 2 Counter Strike Source and Day Of Defeat Source all stole from this game as if they ripped the files straight out of garrys mod valve needs to open their eyes and sue them for this
Cold'er;-;Constructing in this game is full of fun, and enormous amount of game modes makes Garry's Mod a nice place to spend an evening.
Prodigy;-;Its alright, I havent played much of it

Colin969;-;Garry's Mod is purely driven by the community, the fun I personally found came from the variety of gamemodes and servers that the community offered me. I've wasted hour upon hour playing Trouble in Terrorist Town and Deathrun, along you can be sure to find something you like yourself. Aside from the community gamemodes, it does offer Sandbox mode, which allows you to use a massive array of interesting tools, including ones you can easily download from the Workshop to make everything from the most complex of machines to a bath with wheels.

Paul Blart dorito cop;-;Great sandbox game with many gamemodes, the only problem is the performance. Got a slow PC? Enjoy having low framerates on popular servers. Also I still miss Garry's Mod 12, Garry needs to work on Garry's Mod instead of Rust if he doesn't make the game even more worse.
Sebb;-;This game is amazing, countless hours of fun and hundreds of gametypes, addons and extensions. For those who enjoy sandbox , roleplay and creativity this game is one of the best you can get. This is game worth the money.
Ninja Zusky;-;You should totally buy this funny sandbox game to play with your friends or just have fun with addons
sake1001;-;Garry's Mod is one of the most fun games I have ever played. With its amount of game modes you can play it for hours on end without getting bored. This game is easy to run without needing a good computer, which allows more people to play the game.
G'eZz - I'm Back!;-;Yay! i love Garry's Mod, u can do whatever u want! And is a lot of fun! =3
Enchigeddon;-;Addicting as fawk
tell me more;-;Crying Kids everywhere,lots of fun and always something new play and explore. + You can shoot Nazi Zombies as a Melon 69/10
N0thing Special;-;There are melons 11/10
Colin969;-;Garry's Mod is purely driven by the community, the fun I personally found came from the variety of gamemodes and servers that the community offered me. I've wasted hour upon hour playing Trouble in Terrorist Town and Deathrun, along you can be sure to find something you like yourself. Aside from the community gamemodes, it does offer Sandbox mode, which allows you to use a massive array of interesting tools, including ones you can easily download from the Workshop to make everything from the most complex of machines to a bath with wheels.
John Cena;-;I can ride a baby like a car, hurl my friends off of the map, fire a cannon that shoots melons, and make sexual jokes by simply crouching the wrong way. Great way to make an early 2000's game have staying power. 10/10.
Suplex City :D;-;it is a really good game
Danny Laad;-;With hundreds of different ways to play , a huge and active community and the fact that the price goes down to 2 all the time there is no reason not to buy! Great game would recommend!
Robbie Rotten;-;I believe this game is the pinnacle of video gaming. If you want to watch porn, but you want to do it through a crappy movie theater-esque setting, just join cinema. If you want to become a nazi and do nazi like things, such as hunt down the enimies of the Fhrer, then join a nazi role play server. If you want to make a house out of pallets, and then blow it up with a condom that shoots missiles, you entirely can through mods. In all, 10 out of 10, would bang. 9 out of 12 birds agree, it is a great game.
Coco | Grid;-;Great dating service. Find true love now!
Devol | APP;-;After spending two years with the best game I've ever played, I've been seriously changed. Not only did Garry's Mod change my life, it changed the way that I work. Thanks to Garry's Mod, I am fluent in three coding languages.
Mbcmax;-;this game = fine
rodger swaggins;-;After more than 3,600 hours and over 3 years of Lua experience, i decided to update this review. Garry's Mod is sandbox game, you shouldn't expect anything very big. So let's start from workshop, on GMod workshop you could find a huge amount of pointless, poorly made Dupes/Saves/Weapons that are just same and same category(A good example could be M9K or FNAF, yes you dont get to see anything special very often), but if you get to see addon that someone put effort in and didn't used a template, author must be experienced. Most of servers are just s***, having only Coderhire and random Workshop addons, but if you get to see a server with most of stuff self-made and without 12-years old admins, you shouldn't miss it. Community is filled with 12-years olds(especially on sales), Thought they're uncommon on not-so-popular servers, but if you get to see a good community that doesn't just bans you for smallest mistakes, you still shouldn't miss it(Even in Garry's Mod, you could meet your worst nightmare, "12-years old server owner"). But, unlike most of sandbox games, Garry's Mod could be edited to any other game genre, a good example could be Prophunt, where 'Props' have to hide from 'Hunters' by changing their model to any physics prop they could find. Also, GMod could be a good alternative to SFM, since in GMod Sandbox, you could pose 'ragdolls'(character bodies) to any pose, and with specific tools you could really make something really interesting. And the final rating is: 9.5/10 - Garry, you should listen to your community and stop making money off Rust(which is another story). Oh, before i forget, you also need Counter-Strike: Source to play most of gamemodes(just to don't see at bunch of black-and-purple checkers or 'ERROR' signs).
xXxC8chilu'xXx;-;Many of you may play this game just for the joy of creation or for shooting/stabbing NPCs all day, it doesn't matter. If you're reading this, buy it now!
El Mesas de la Muerte;-;Pose ragdolls in sexual positions and make eight year olds cry in multiplayer. Gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8
DarkSoldierPL;-;THE BEST GAME EVER !
Gamer Z;-;Garry's Mod is a spectacular and original game. It is probably the most addicting game that I have played so far. However, like all games, there are some downfalls. This review will review the ups and downs of Garry's Mod. Gameplay: 8/10 The gameplay is probably 100's of hours of fun. There are a ton of gamemodes (some popular, others not so much), enough to keep you occupied. The objects in the game are, however, ripped straight from CS:S, HL2, TF2, and other games. But there are people who make new content in the workshop so you can never get bored from the items in your "toybox". Also, I never had to argue with the controls either. They are very smooth and fluid! Graphics: 6/8 The graphics on this game are somewhat outdated, however I believe that graphics do not in any way affect the quality of the game. These outdated graphics actually somewhat adds to the game's "personality". It adds to the game's "character". The graphics themselves may not be attractive, but it does add to the game in ways. Overall: 8/10 This game is a must-buy! Every time
Fridge;-;You can play as a watermelon.
Wii Fit Trainer;-;Finally, a game that it's main purpose is to mod the ever living hell out of it. This is the original ''Mod it 'til it crashes'' game. Spawned 500 explosive barrels, put it in one room, shot them, game crashed. 10/10
coolmode02;-;I like garrys mod i would recommend this game for anybody you can do anything you want
Sigmafang;-;Definitely one of the greatest sandbox games out there. I had tons of fun messing with everything the game has to offer with my friends. 10/10
Skullboy   _  Ameno;-;You. Need. This. Game. There are countless gamemodes and sandbox addons, you're guaranteed to have fun. Especially with games. TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) is one of the best game modes. You just need to find a good server that doesn't have 12 year old admins. I recommend City Mayhem's TTT servers.
jew prank (GONE SEXUAL);-;Boo for Garry's Mod 13!
Helen;-;I can't have enough of this game. It just never gets old! There's a variety of mods in the game to pick and play and each one promises you one word: FUN! :)
jew prank (GONE SEXUAL);-;Boo for Garry's Mod 13!

s y n d r a ';-;I like "PropHunt" that's in' funny <3
I killed kenny;-;Pick a gamemode, pick a server, then run, stab, shoot, hide, become a watermelon, just do whatever. It's tons of fun, as long as you find the right people to play with.
Dekurius;-;hard to elieve a game from 2006 would look this good! gameplay is still fun and inventive i rate it 9/5!
Crabislav;-;It's 2014 but you still don't have this game? No matter what genre of games you're into - this game has everything.
Ashley;-;There are so many game types people have created in Garry's Mod that it's impossible to not find something you like. There are 3 game modes I currently play, and those are Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, and Murder. Keep in mind there are tons more, but those are the ones I have tried. So, when someone first got me this game, I thought it was a boring sandbox game until this same friend of mine told me that the sandbox is just one little feature. There are mods within the mod. Let me explain Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) because it is an incredibly popular mode. In TTT, you've got three types of people you can be per round randomly chosen. Innocent, traitor, or detective. As an innocent you walk around the map with chosen gun that you can pick up from the ground. When you spawn there are all kinds of weapons. Your goal is to not die. And find the traitors. You cannot kill people randomly without proof that they have done something wrong. You can shoot them if they start shooting at you, for example, or you catch them in the act of shooting someone else. It's a very social game, so you would announce to the lobby to kill this person on sight, as they are shooting at me. Also known as a KOS on their player name. They are also a traitor if you see them using an item or weapon that regular innocents do not have access to, like knives, c4, silenced awp, silenced pistol and automatic, among other things. If you kill a traitor (you would know if you identified the body of the person you shot- which you should always do as an innocent if you came across a dead body), you can then say you are proven. See, the rest of the lobby doesn't know you are innocent. You are just as suspiscious as anyone else. So, on to traitors. Long story short, kill everyone except fellow traitors. You can buy special weapons and items like radar to help you, using in game credits achieved from killing innocents. Don't get caught, or else the whole lobby is out to get you and that makes winning quite hard on your part. Sniping helps, disguises help, and planting c4 explosives when noone is around gives you an advantage. Being a traitor involves being sly. Don't be too quiet in game... people may think you're a traitor. Try to change the story. A silver tongue will help you. Ok. Detectives. You are an innocent with more power...you can get DNA off dead bodies to find traitors, you can buy health stations, radar, ammo, silenced awp, and the like. Your job is to track the traitors down. And that's about it! Different servers have different things for their TTT, but that's just one of the amazing things about this game.
Speedy;-;Garry's Mod A Sandbox Of one of a kind. you have a menu called the Q menu which by default is brought up with the letter Q. You can spawn objects and make your own scenes/roleplay/Build A fort to defend it from hostiles. 9/10
[FG]Friends;-;Garry's Mod is by far my favorite game that I have ever played. There is just so much stuff to do that I never get bored of it. I have even started up a couple of servers too for the gamemode Trouble in Terrorist Town! ("[FG] Friends Gaming TTT" and "[FG] Friends Gaming LA TTT") FREE ADVERTISING xP. But seriously, an AMAZING game.
SchogetteN;-;You can spawn Watermelo 10/10 - IGN

Prof. Salmon;-;Sandbox is worth getting alone, all the gamemodes are priceless
Drizzle;-;This game is so ing good.

There is no DLC for this game... HAVE FUN!
K8tesGames;-;Lot's of fun and can make you lose hours of your day without noticing. Buy CounterStrike Source and Half mod with this otherwise you will not have some of the textures.
Arcion Holy Windmaster;-;Amazing Game. good friends i made on it. and gameplay is just so amazing. with custom everything :3
elezo;-;This Game Is Game!
Chef Boyard;-;Mod with mods in it. Modception. Many mods, custom content, many games and modes. Good buy. The community generated content is great and the amount of creativity within the game itself is absolutely amazing. There are custom game types, skins, buildings, models, textures, maps, softwares and a whole lot more. The possibilities are endless with this game.
Aronith;-;its great if you dont like the outside world and you can spawn melons, thats good
MrJakeyBoy;-;The best game I've ever played in my whole life.

greenbeanx2o;-;Touch and Tease 2 is a game about making a man . How to play: -The  bar determines the amount of  -Filling this bar will make him erect and  -Interact with the character by left click or drag
Zeriga;-;If freedom is your thing, this is probably your best bet. If newbie friendly is your thing... Run. Garry's Mod is possibly #1 in endless content. (If you know what you're doing.) However, it's very buggy. And this game will crash on you more often than you can say banana. And this game is very user content heavy, and a mod of Half-Life 2. In which it NEEDS a 17+ player base. But 3/4ths the players you will meet will be little children screaming into the mics and trying to wreck everything you do. Basically; Buy it. Just don't expect anything to work, and don't expect to have a good time. (But you never know, you might find a place to be in this game.)
Panda;-;With over 200 hours on Gmod I think it's time i write a review for it. This game is absolutely AMAZING! I definitely recommend this for anyone who just wants to have a bit of fun instead of being alll MLG all the time Also the best WTF moment simulator out there due to the sheer amount of hilarious things that can happen! 10/10
Murderlot;-;I downloaded a naked female ragdoll and masturbated over it If you can wank over a game, you know it's good. 69/10

Star_Hawk_;-;Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway. "Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm... _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more. _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore. _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds. _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want. _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10 Overall 8.5 Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

Valiantttt;-;Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers.

Whether it be a horror (morbus) a survival-simulation (stranded) all the way to being a drug-dealing hobo, (DarkRP) you can be it or play in in Garry's Mod. As you can see by my play hours, I would definitely reccomend it. Look at the sales, look at the reviews...Just..Get this game if you haven't already.
Daniel The Gallade;-;Really fun game with lots of things to do. You can make scenes, you can make videos, screenshots, you can role-play, play other gamemodes such as TTT or prop-hunt, or just pretty much fool around! The possibilities are endless in this game! Be careful though, it can get addicting sometimes...
Cardinal Yankee;-;this game is so fun and i would recommend getting this game, u can have fun with ur friends. Also a good DarkRP server to play on is ByB RP4. It is really fun and u will enjoy it.
R1z;-;Did you know you can spawn G-Man? and change his face to a smilling one. :D Definitely recommended. Have friends with brains? Do you have a brain? Yes, Buy this game. No, Then also buy this game having one of the awesome-est MODS one of my persoanl favourites Prop hunt and Murder. why did I buy this game?

Dewzazter;-;A really fun game with lots of gamemodes and an amazing workshop.
MasterReed;-;This Game Is Awesome, if you Love The Half-Life Series You Should BUY THIS GAME THEN
Sneaky;-;Two words, endless fun! There is so much to do in just a game, it will never get the same over and over, all the mods and stuff. You can keep playing it forever!
Harakhti;-;Remember, kids, Roleplaying is addictive.
Walppurgisnacht;-;you can spawn in anime characters 10/10
Ank;-;Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox game from Valve. Garry's Mod is a complete sandbox game. There are no objectives, storylines, goal or something like those. You're a free to do anything, you can mess around in it, make something, build something, make funny of something and much more everything from Valve best titles. You can pose some ragdolls from any Source games such as Half-Life 2 or Counter-Strike: Source, creating your own battles or just play any game modes that available on this game. Make a funny screenshots, blowing everything you create, making a war or battlefield, all of this you can do with your friends or the public. The best part is the Workshop, you can download even more user created content, game modes, anything or even create your own stuff and share it with everyone. Garry's Mod using the same Source Engine used in Half-Life 2 series, Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source with the same content from those game. It's not a copycat game, but rather something to play around with stuff from those games. With the same physics effects you can throw stuff or body around, or you can even construct something from your mind. Garry's Mod is good when you just want to mess around, especially with friends. I recommend this. Rating 9/10
Natsu;-;I guess it's alright.
Walker;-;A friend bought me this game because I liked Minecraft. After messing around in it for an hour didn't go back to it for almost a year and a half. When I did I saw that there were other game types and I tried a few. Finding TTT was the worst thing that could have happened. I have sunk so many damn hours in to the game having a blast at the same time.....then I started to run my own server. Now I want to die. Please kill me. End me and kill Mythtown.
pepsi;-;If this game was a potato...It would be a good potato.
Yakuza Merkitzi;-;This is one of the best games i ever played. i love doing vids and Poses in gmod.
Mysterious Dolphin;-;I was a Gherkin running naked through the wilderness. Than I awoke to become a salami, a salami who had an Olive inside of him. You see I was a pregnant salami. The olive came out of my little white holes to be gobbled up by the National Animal of Scotland, thats right the Unicorn! As I grieved for my digesting son I felt a ripping sensation than I looked up to see Wood, the wood of George Washington's teeth. As George Washington began to chew me, I saw it emerge from his throat it was the ghost of former Conservative Prime Minister and ultimate bachelor Edward Heath! As I bowed down to Heath he entered me through the nostrils, I than became the slightly eyebrowless but still amazingly awesome Edward Heath. Than I escaped and was in a pair of dark trousers filled with pink marshmallows and as I bounced on their bounciness I saw something familiar it was my so, the one who was inside me my Olive! As we came together we hugged as the pants around us exploded from a gastronomic fart. I made it, my son did not as I was being stitched together by a strange man known only as the doctor I cried out my inner fatty oils, and I laid still, he than handed me the deli meat stone. I than evolved like a Pikachu to Raichu on touch, from my regular Plain flavoured Salami to Ultra Spice Salami. I than became the best deli meat no one ever was surviving a cooking from Bowser and some strange pills from Dr Mario. Alas I must go now but my journey has just begun and so has yours my internet friends!
Prisma;-;Buggiest game I've ever played, Crashes frequently without warning. 10/10

Thee Man;-;A Really nice game that you can play alone or with friends
ShineMYShoes;-;Garry's mod is a game created by Garry. Garry's mod offers everything from KOS scrublords to rap music mic spam. The gameplay of Garry's Mod is amazing. The main thing you will do in Garry's Mod is watch austistic cod quickscopers kill on sight everybody around them. If you enjoy listing to people say whatever is on their mind at the moment and the pleasure of blowing out your ear drums then Garry's Mod is for you!
Shigure Kai Ni;-;If you're one of those players who can't afford to buy other games or if you just plain love to mod everything you see, then Garry's Mod is the game for you. All the game modes for the price of one.
Darkhowlingwolf;-;hi bros if u dont have this game u should get it
Dr Batman PhD;-;Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you.
Sugar VectorZ;-;Pc Master Race
Nope.;-;If You're under 13 years old, i recommend this game for you!
100% GUTTA (ISIS);-;This game is pretty bad, i had to put that i recommend this crap even tho i don't because of the devknights. Already posted a review and it got downvoted to hell in a second (more than 50 dislikes in a day). This is why i give this shit a bad review : -Shit developers (took like 2 years to fix a exploit to download server-sided files such as server.cfg aka get rcon in a second) -Shit workshop (addons backdoored so shitty minges can give themselves admin, shitty addons overall, errors everywhere) -Loading screen (to join a server and not see basically everything as an error you gotta enable downloads, so get used to download useless shit for each server with an average of 1gb~3gb for each server and i hope you like loud shitty dubstep music, because since admins have the choice to change the default loading screen to an html file they include a shitty flash mp3 player with, of course, no pause/volume controls ) http://prntscr.com/5qgd1u -Admins (autistic children that paid 1 dollar to get admin will annoy/kick/ban you for ever) -Shit fanbase (autistic children, autistic ddosers, autistic bad trollers) -Shit framerate (seriously, if you had like 300 fps on half life 2 you would have like 90 in gmod on a far simpler map, aka flatgrass WHICH IS JUST FUCKING FLAT GROUND WITH A TEXTURE) Yes, i played this crap over 1,000 hours; so what? i need feedback to make a review. if you wanna buy this game i'll give you a hint : don't, you are probably gonna rage more than have actual fun
Forcer96;-;It is. Life itself. Contained into a small core of a game that began as just a simple mod for HL2, And it transformed into the essence and core of life itself.
Frumorn;-;Garry's Mod, a Sandbox game that you can build everything you want, for example, you can build a trap, or a building, or a melon launcher, or EVEN MORE! You can spawn NPCs and create wars or build with your friends or strangers in MULTIPLAYER! One of the best games I ever played.
MirroR;-;Drama machine 3.5 if you have ponyphobia you should play this game.
[WatchingBigBrother] Crummon;-;Probably the most fun game I ever played. It's limitless, you can do whatever you want in it, and it has many different gamemodes like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Murder, Melonbomber, Elevator: Source, Zombie Survival and many more which are just awesome! :D You can create things, make them explode, make and kill zombies, kill people and so many other things. It's a sandbox game that is one of the best of all!
fade.to.oblivion;-;10/10 would bang
Bailey;-;This game was pretty much the basis of me becoming more interested in games, the same goes for alot of other gamers aswell. The wide variety of game modes and addons bring more hours of fun to the game. The funnest game modes for me were TTT, Basewars and Minigames, which is where I spent the majority of my Garry's Mod time. There are also servers that you can relax on, such as the Cinema servers, and watch what you and those around you are interested in. If you have yet to play/buy this game, I would really recommend you get this as I would describe it as a necessity for any PC Gamer. 9.5/10
TylerB;-;Game's pretty fun if you learn how to script, or you nlearn how to make vehicle suspension. (you know I'm not lying, I have 14,000 hours)
mallard;-;I spent a small amount of time playing this game. It was good.
KU-KU;-;BEST GAME I PLAYED IN MY LIVE IS INTERTAINING AND FUN WHEN YOUR PLAYING WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND EVEN WHEN YOU ARE OFFLINE IF INTERTAINING YOU WILL NEVER GET BORED :d
Mr. Boog (Xenianmatter);-;The gift that keeps on giving. Met so many people on here, and have so much fun. Definately worth it.
WerewolfNightmare;-;The One Sandbox game to rule them all.
TheSimplePepsi;-;A truly wonderful game which has almost unlimited possibilities. Sure, there are the FPS-style modes like TTT, but if you just want to play at a much slower pace there are modes such as Cinema and SledBuild. Also, if you want to dedicate a lot of time into it, you can pose character models from, say, TF2, and create a stop-motion video. Garry's Mod satisfies a large variety of gamers with its different modes, and that makes it something special.
MrXonte;-;One of the most fun games i've ever played thanks to its high flexibility and modibility^^ first game i thought was worth getting a server
(u) | Goplex;-;Fun player base and endless possibilities on and off a server.
Gondile;-;So I was looking at my list of games most played and it turns out Garry's Mod is snuggled up there in #2nd place, nestled between Team Conga Simulator 2 and Civilization Vee. My old review was so cringe inducing that your face had a high probability of warping inside of itself to avoid reading the  linen words. Christ, why was it so cringy? What went through my mind that ultimately led to me vomitting on my keyboard and hitting enter? Man, that's crazy. I don't even remember cleaning vomit off of my keyboard. Maybe that never even happened. Could I be making all this up? Was there ever even a keyboard? How do we know keyboards even exist? What am I typing on? A Keyboard? Oh, okay, I guess they do exist then. It'd be pretty crazy if they didn't though. It'd be as crazy as a mouse not existing. Imagine, a world without mice. Shows like Tom and Jerry would just be called Tom and himself. Or maybe just Tom. Or it could be called "A Descent Into Madness: The Tomcat Tale." Oh. I get it. That's why his name is Tom, because of the word "Tomcat." But then why is Jerry's name Jerry? Because it rhymes with berry, and it's small like a berry? Or maybe he was named after Jerry Seinfeld? The resemblance is uncanny. Oh, Garry's Mod? Yeah, it's alright.
MediExcalibur2012;-;For those who animate, can only do it so with a hint of RubberFruit. Otherwise, no one aint gonna want to watch it
Peasqueak;-;I DUN NER IF EWE LIEK CATZ BUTT I LIEK CATZ AND I SED BUTT HAHA BUTT ANEHOO U SHULD GET TIZ GAEM BECUZ OF THE CATZ AND IT ALSO HAZ GUNZ SO IT IZ LIEK A CALL OF DUTY REMAKE AND STUFF AND EVERE 1 NOSE CALL OF DUTY IS THE BEST SERIES EVER SO BUY THIS GAME!
Flaming_Pheonix;-;When i First Got This game i thought it was just a game where you build Then i realized That it's more than just building its also doing a run for the end like Deathrun So i realized it was alot better! You should Buy this game! :D
Taffy;-;Garry's Mod is an amazing game where the possibilities are endless! The wide variety of gamemodes and fantastic addons make the game even better, with an awesome community creating brand-new content 24/7! I would recommend Garry's Mod to anyone just looking for a fun, new game! There's something out there for everyone!
corey applesauce;-;So, if you don't know what Garry's Mod is well, it's basically a Physics/Sandbox game featuring many different Mods and Addons across a handful of interesting Game Modes. Imagine a world where creation is limited by nothing else but your imagination. Then, sprinkle some annoying little kids, and no-life try-hards onto that and... WALLA! You have Garry's Mod! A hectic game with an incredibly diverse community! The game itself is fantastic! That is, when it's not crashing, creating errors or just flat out not cooperating with the Steam Workshop. But, when it is working you will NEVER regret spending 10 bucks on this masterpiece. If you like building, this game is for you! If you like first person shooters, this game is for you! If you like driving, this game is for you! If you like RPG's (the weapon, and the game genre), this game is for you! if you like Call of Duty, Go "F" yourself! In conclusion, download this game right now!
Jake_;-;make's me want to hit a shoe on my head and shove a remote up my butt on the loading screens.

RandomBull406;-;Great game, it's really fun to play, 19/10!
SoulessW;-;i love that game
Klaus fenschtien;-;A great game for unstoppable laughing, meet new friends, and waste hours upon hours of your time.
KillerBurak601;-;I've been playing this thing for 9 year's now. I found amazing friend's amazing creation's. But the important thing is: I had great fun! Last 9 year ( 5 year pirate) was amazing because of this game. I hope garry's mod never dies. You want to test something? Play singleplayer. You want to laugh like an maniac with your friends? Hosting server is too easy. There is alot of co-op and multiplayer mod's such as murderer, trouble in terrorist town,sandbox etc. Pc gamer's say: Mod it till it breaks well this is why gmod exists in the first place. so grab a friend join a server and start rolling. Amazing/10 Thank you garry.
PrincessMeganAnnLeBlanc;-;One Of The Funniest, Time Consuming, And Creative Games I've Ever Played On ;)
I Make Mixtapes Ladies;-;Look at my hours played. Do i like it?
Skyward;-;You can either use this for good, or for evil. You could build awesome mansions, play prop hunt, or roleplay, or you could make ragdolls do weird poses, RDM, and prop kill. Either way is still fun. 999666420911/10
mzda_grl;-;This is so cool and ridiculous. You can do anything. I personally like sending corpses into the air using balloons.... yep, you can do anything.
Quark;-;i'd recommend this game to all of America, north and south i'd also recommend this game to Vin Diesle, Doritos, Sanic and last but not least Michelle Obama, my love.
funion;-;I don't think I've ever played a game longer than Garry's Mod. Ever since gmod 9 I have been building various interests of the mind and playing so many different gamemodes that this game should be considered multiple games in one. Although the community isn't as strong today as it was, there is no better place to make a server with friends and build random creations to the hearts content. (or until one of your "friends" blows your  up) I should also mention the better part of the online community now is made up of rp'ers or people playing trouble in terrorist town.
TheManicman23;-;Amazing game! Always lots of fun!
[P: TG] Evitro;-;The only game where there can be a minecraft pig playing TF2 on a portal map, with sunglasses.
Telstra;-;10/10 would play again
== Kyubey;-;If you have steam, garry's mod is a necessity. Simple as that.
Pvt. Parts;-;You can play as a watermelon. 10/10
Splat;-;This game gives you a choice, You can download most of the games needed for it or use addons. Very fun for multiplayer too just stay of of DarkRP that's a hazard.
Saow;-;its an awesome game i recommend buying it with cs source or if you dont have much money to buy both gmod and cs just buy gmod and download cs textures for free so some gamemodes like Trouble In Terrorist Town would work perfectly.
ArditFerati;-;Don't get a life, buy this.
Joshua baker the lumberjack;-;really great game for everyone
Majestic The Canadian Goose;-;this game is funny as hell get it
Syra'Cat;-;Great Game ! , You Can play with your friends , Is very funny , they are the mod murder or deathrun or Trouble In Terrorist Town , Bunny Hop , Jailbreak , Melonbomber ect , Go buy it and go play with your friends !!
gabe;-;I have wasted so much of my life on the great game so should you. This game has helped me meet most of my friends i play with to this day. I would invest in this game is you were smart.
Mjdog96;-;One of the best games I have ever been brought into. Its got everything in it. Anything you love, its there. So many games to play. Only bad part is that you need Counter Strike Source to not have errors in most gamemodes. This game is DEFINATELY worth the $25 you spend on it. Get it. Try it. If you dont like a gamemode, go play a different. I found some I play for hours upon hours. None get boring. BUY THIS GAME
Bark-Kun;-;Is good. Should get. Plus CS:Source.
Kami;-;This game is awesome just get this and counter strike source and you set to an amazing addiction! I just love this game so much :D
Kaleidoscope;-;Garry's mod is wonderfully made, and is a staple for any Steam owner. The many gamemodes allow you to figure out what you enjoy doing. Don't like TTT? Try Dark RP. Don't like Dark RP? Try elevator source. There's so many, it's literally impossible to get bored with this game. Not to mention many, many laughs had in multiplayer. I would reccomend the multiplayer more than the singleplayer, just because it's that much more fun with other people. When you start out, though, just mess around in single player to figure out the controls and such. If you get bored with the regular content, there are thousands upon thousands of mods to download! This is a great game, and is getting better all the time.
Hoodlook;-;..yees. Pure and simple. Best sandbox game ever.
fliplap;-;I've played over 1000 hours of this game and I still don't understand the plot.
Borderlan;-;This game, or rather this software is a PURE GEM!!! This sort of gaming creation framework lets your imagination run wild! And for people whose primary skills aren't design/conception, many (I mean, REALLY MANY) excellents crafts made by community build original, audacious and generally addictively fun multiplayer gamemodes. There are probably more than a 100 mods. All are not equal, but you're sure to find at least half a dozen mods that will entertain you for dozen hours. Among my personal favourites: Prop Hunt (1 team incarnate daily-life objects, other team has to find and destroy them), Trouble in Terrorist Town (x terrorists, >1 traitor, many possibilities), Melon Bomber (exhilarating Bomberman clone), Bomber Barrel (1 explosive barrel hidden among many, infinite spawn, has to kill all humans in imparted time -killed humains become barrels too), Deathrun (try to run to exit while avoiding traps), Stranded (like Rust or DayZ), Stalker (one powerful alien against marines team) etc... Some gamemodes even propose some "serious" (aka time-investing) roleplay. All of this juicy, thrilling, exciting and foremost unique experience for a mere few bucks. And it's Linux-compatible to boot. Really, what are you waiting for? Join us in the fun already!!
Hai_L9;-;While its platform is slow and a bit buggy, the shear amount of creativity and freedom Garry's Mod allows makes possibilities for fun endless. One of the best games around in my book. 9/10
ReiGn'Maeel Javanar;-;I have over 600 hours and most of my friends play it. 'nuff said.
Wreckless Cookie;-;Yes, Garry's mod got everything for everyone, even if you don't like a game mode theres like 1000+ other ones, so you will almost always find something you like. I like Trouble in terrorist town the most and it seems like its the most popular gamemode
Ddude;-;Im almost certain I wasted a quarter of my life playing this game.
o0EnderGamer0o;-;Awesome Game full of online content never gets boring if you know where to look! :)
John-Fox;-;What i really like about Garrys Mod is the endless possiablity's of how to kill all Npc's, may it be With a Tank or a bomb either way the this game is full of possiablity's
Something Unknown;-;Garrysmod has been with me since the beginning of 2014, and it has been a great game to play. You can go on servers and socialize with others and get to make good friends, I had made already 6 new friends this year alone (2014) just playing Garrysmod. You can also add addons to make the game even more fun for you, which you can use in Singplayer but also servers might have the addons you have so you can play with others using those fun addons! Also you can make Pacs which mean Player Appearance Customizer, using this tool, you can make a great appearance for yourself which can wow others. Also there are gamemodes you can use such as Murder which are fun because if it was just only Sandbox which is like a gamemode in which you make things and just hangout it would be boring but with these other gamemodes such as Murder it makes the game very fun. Even though there are some downfalls such as people being rude and things just try to ignore it and have fun doing what you want to do.
DragonVich ..:[LFR-O]:..;-;In this Awesome Game you can Act,Roleplay,Build Its Awesome You Should buy it.
ez. Phoenix;-;Garry's mod is a very good game with tons of mini games inside, When online it is impossible to get bored because there is always a gamemode to play, i highley recommend playing it. The downside to it is that u have to buy css aswell to get most of the textures and have tf2 downloaded, but apart from that and some bugs with Addons it is a really good game and you should play it! :)
Makk3 |11|;-;-Best sandbox game that I have seen/played ------------------------------------------------ -I love when the games can link up, fot exaple if you have c:ss you can play ttt -If you are going to buy this I recomend you buy c:ss too because of the gamemodes and textures -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Why to buy: -creativity -mini games -fun with friends (if you dont have any you can make them in the game) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10/10 loving it
[TGS] Lord Phoenix IX;-;This game is amazing. you can do anything. You can download mods. You can get hats. you can blow up Wallace Breen over and over again. Need i say more? This game is so expansive. there is always so much to do. Sure, it can lag and crash, and you need quite a few things to get it perfect, but in the end, it is amazing. i play it on a sub-par pc with craploads of addons to make the game run smoothly, and it works. Overall, if you have a brain cell or two, you would get this game. Also, have you SEEN the workshop for this game. FREAKING HUGE. so much cool stuff. so yea, get this game, idiot. get it and be amazed.
.7;-;If you play this. You need this. ;) It's a fun addition. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=132780836 Gmod Tower. Click subscribe.
Dead Hobo Mittens;-;I love this game, Favorite gamemode is Jailbreak. But its mainly fun for online single player is kinda boring if you don't know how to build or aren't very creative.
Trizt;-;Garry's mod is the best sandbox game i have ever played there is just so much to it that i can not even explain-because it is on the source engine modibility is very easy and you can pretty much make your own game inside of the game and have fortresses made of steel and brick or fortresses made of toilets it is a pretty amazing experience and a must for all gamers.
Saevus;-;Super fun with the right community, highly recommended
Wooper [7 Months Until Bday];-;I love this game i got it a few months ago and i love it!
The Inquiring Frog d;-;A million games in one. Anything you want to try can be tried on this game with the correct knowledge.
Detective Termy;-;1000+ Hours wasted of my life 5 stars.. Good Job Garry
BLU;-;Gmod is a good game, Others are very good at gmod like me and many, We like to mess around with stuff, Make some art, Videos, And many more, So i recommend to get this game if you want to have a good time :)
TheRealK1LL3R;-;Love this game so much to do!
Kyle tha Wolfie;-;Best game ever. No questions about it. If you wanted to blow up a mountain of boxes because of some strange fetish, heres the place to do it!
HowYouDoin' #Soma;-;this is a very funny game even my 3 yr old brother plays it
Fuze_cap;-;I have given this game over 200 hours of thought and know that this is the reason for getiing a gaming pc. For 10 bucks you get a great game that has been perfected with the number of community mods. If you are new to steam and want a game that has everything, this is your game. The sandbox is awsome and prop hunt is really fun too. You will not regret buying this. -Fuze
[TNN]Networkzz;-;What do you hate about this game
Benji;-;Garry's mod, one of the most fun games I have ever played. Playing alone, Garry's mod is a good game as you can meet many people across a variety of different servers and gametypes that want to just mess around and have fun. However, Garry's mod is designed to be played with friends and when you have a group of friends together on a Garry's mod server, it makes for some memorable moments that will stick with you for quite some time. I mean, creating a Hoboville in a Role playing server and starting a revolution as a gang of hobos who have ascended to a full crime syndicate; who take over the city and rule under a stinky bugbait fist - is pretty memorable. Role playing servers are not the only servers though, no, there are hundreds of gamemodes to choose from on the easy to use server browser and interface in general. So you just need to play a little of each, see what you like, and get some friends on. Garry's mod gametypes, such as prophunt and murder, are very popular on Youtube at the moment, so there is likely to be an influx in players buying Garry's mod in sales - where it can drop down to as cheap as 1.49. (~$2.44 ) Overall Garry's mod is the ultimate 'screw around' game, and if you don't pick it up in a sale you should be sentenced to death by snu snu.
[DSL] DarthMan;-;So many different things you could do almost has something for everyone. Can get a bit boring if you don't like the multiplayer but you always find yourself coming back. 6.5/10
Pirate Captain Paws;-;You can never have a dull moment in G-mod! So much to do and so much to see!
[FD] [FC&N] Spike;-;This game has many gamemodes roleplay, sandbox, hunger games and lots more! This game also has all kinds of mods like wiremod for making confusing stuff, weapons npc's, tools, dupes and way more! This game is mostly about building and fighting. I recommend u play this game!
Stawri;-;OVER 9000/10. Its that amazing.
Zero-One;-;What can I say? Amazing sandbox game with unlimited possiblities on end. Become this, do that, destroy this, build that, kill him, resurrect her, do whatever you wish. Most immersive sandbox game I have played in awhile. Add on the fact with all the Steam Workshop Mods, as well as FacePunch Forum Mods, this game is neverending with new things to discover, and new things to build. Great thing is, you don't have to do it alone. By default, there are two gamemodes, sandbox, and TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) where it goes from building to proving the guilty, proving your innocence, or even killing ever last living soul. Would play again.
Gemsie #newhouse;-;What other game can you Blow stuff up, make npcs have sex, and do drugs.....besides gta
Homeless Polarbear;-;Its like my grandma but with more things you can do
{116} Solar;-;GREAT Game with great servers and gamemodes
fonzen;-;garry have priorites. * u can kill things * u can build things * u can be things * u can pretend to be things * u can have a life finally 10/10 would do again
Nicklordzero;-;Garry's Mod is possibly the BEST Source Engine Based Sandbox game in history! This game has a wonderful community (As long as you filter through the crappy ones). You can NEVER BE BORED in this game. I AM SERIOUS! Their is a vast amount of game modes and still more to come! Very clean and clear graphics, Hundreds of Maps and Game Modes. My Ratings: Single Player = 8/10 Multiplayer = 6/10
The Awesome Overlord;-;Garry's Mod. What can I say? A mindless, enjoyable game where you are basically God. At first it bugged me that I only had 2 maps, but then I subscribed to more and I have 4 now. I really like that you can be killed by the larger ragdolls (realism) and when they land from high above there is a seismic wave and everything. I don't like that sometimes you spawn in places you weren't meant to spawn in after you die because you can't move out of them. I also don't like that you get stuck in the ragdolls. But it is still a mindless free play that, if you learn to like it, is awesome (like me :3). I definently would say that if you're interested, play this game. You can do almost anything (literally). Thumbs up for this game!
vozah =DD;-;fun, doing this for community challenges or whatever

Wolfsitize;-;Trouble In Terrorist Town (game mode) is probably one of the most addicting things I have ever played.

Damo2021;-;One of the best sandbox games ever made
[CCG] CyberPwn;-;This game is an open Sandbox so you make the game how you want it to be. I thought i would share a few points: - You don't need a awesome PC to run it. - The ragdoll feature is amazing if you dont put them in place propley they might just fly out of the map! - The gravity gun from Half-life is upgraded to THE PYPICS GUN which is also awesome! - Cars to rideable Dogs there are laods of vericals ready to be downloaded with one click! - You can also downlode maps, gamemodes, weapons, Balls and other things real people have made half way across the world! - There is so much fun to have in this game it great! -There is also a muiltiplayer Feature!
Wiicker95 (RIP);-;Highly addictive and fun game with a plethora of gaming modes. By buying it, you get, AT LEAST, 300 hours of PURE AWESOMENESS. Be it just wandering around, killing everyone on sight, driving cool vehicles or building up an empire, you will absolutely love this game.
Tigster;-;Amaziing wonderful imaginitive game packed with over 50,000 mods i strongly suggest you buy this sandbox game there is so much to do on multiplayer and so many awesome servers i recconmend this game for people who love fun if you dont then dont buy it simple! PS. Look at dat price tho
Comrade Mudkip;-;I didn't need a life anyways.
$uokukko 8);-;My screenshots say it all. 10/10.
Aieera;-;This game was pretty much the basis of me becoming more interested in games, the same goes for alot of other gamers aswell. The wide variety of game modes and addons bring more hours of fun to the game. The funnest game modes for me were Stranded, Deathrun and Dark rp which is where I spent the majority of my Garry's Mod time. There are also servers that you can relax on, such as the Cinema servers, and watch what you and those around you are interested in. If you have yet to play/buy this game, I would really recommend you get this as I would describe it as a necessity for any PC Gamer
Jojjannes;-;Whilst I've never really seen the appeal of the creator aspects of this game I've had lots of fun playing and trying out the things that other people have created. From things like Trouble in terrorist town, Murder and Prophunt and to something more crazy like The Elevator Mod. This game is great if you play with friends and whilst it differs from person to person what they enjoy you can find lots of different gamemodes always coming out and it will make sure you'll never get bored.
Miss Marseille;-;Totally a Defining Game for PC Gamers.
Kaj3n;-;Just buy it.
[JABOY] UVwaterboy23;-;This is one of my favorite games on Steam hands down!
olofmeister;-;Possibly the best game on Steam..
uPtoN;-;This game is just amazing, it's an Sandbox game which is creative like Minecraft but it's like FPS-shooter game, you can build stuff, play with friends play horror mode and play some other fun gamemodes! Here is some popular gamemodes: Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) Facts: (Traitor Role) In this gamemode there is 1-4 traitors depending on how many players there are on the server and how much the server is limited, probably most normaly it's 3 traitors, they need to work and kill the innocents before the time runs out, they can't just make a massacare, they need to teamwork and silently kill the innocents, traitors can buy only traitor items, which are useful when it comes to killing surviving and more, traitors must kill the person silently, otherwise if one innocent see that an traitor killed an innocent, the innocent will start to attack the traitor. (Innocent Role) As an innocent you don't know which to kill and which to not kill, and that means you can't trust anyone untill he is proven by killing an traitor, but you can't just random-kill people, because then you will get banned mostly, because you need evidence, proof that he is the traitor, but, you need to make sure you don't kill an innocent person when you think it's him, the main role for innocents is to survive the round and not make any mistakes. (Detective Role) When you are detective you are a detective, you can buy only detective items like the traitors but detective ones, the detective ones gives you an ability to detect stuff, and you can buy an Health Station, to regen your innocent comrades, but there will be traitors too that is using it, you have an special item called ''DNA SCANNER'' that is an item that you scan for DNA, if you see an dead body, use the DNA scanner to find an figure out who killed him, you will see that the DNA leads to a person, if not the DNA got expired or the victim got sniped and didnt leave any DNA from the killer, so the main role of this is just to figure out who the traitor is, but beware, the traitors are taking you down first! So you need to make sure you don't trust any traitors! This game is so worth it! My favourite gamemode is the Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) The game is really cheap, you should check it out, give it an try! You will 100% like it!
Charles Chimp;-;You will straight away blown away by how much content has been packed into this game and how brilliant the community is. It was a genius idea to make a sandbox using the Source engine, and just the fact that you can have the Heavy and G-Man high-five eachother is awesome. Some people may not like the bugs, but luckily they're more funny than game-breaking. Plus this game never runs out of things to do, since it supports modding and online multiplayer. 9/10.
Tyrone Mc. Biscuit;-;Very fun with endless possibilities.
Rick *Ayy Lmao*;-;One of the best games ever! Spend most of the time playing it. You will never get bored from it because it have many mods and many many fun things to play!
Private twinkle toes;-;Garry's Mod is great in every way, I feakin love this game!!! I simply can't get off it it's sooo addicting! I mean there's a LOT of things you can do in this game like building a car or making pictures and Garry's mod videos... I would recommend this game you should get it it's fun!
Wrath;-;Garry's Mod is a great game with many fun things to do. You'll probably start out by playing the singleplayer sandbox mode and gradually move onto other gamemodes such as Trouble in Terrorist Town, which in my opinion is one of the best. When buying Garry's Mod, consider getting the bundle that contains Counter-Strike: Source, as it's used for many textures and models in gamemodes other than sandbox. My personal rating is 10/10.
Practical Problems;-;I have no idea how to play. This is too way hard than SFM.
Mister Captain;-;Played this for about 2000 hours. What do you think I will say. One of the best game/mods out there. So many gamemodes too. It's super awesome and fun. Sandbox to RP. Name it and Gmod (Garry's Mod) got it. I would rate this 5/5 Garries.
Abstract Thoughts;-;IT IS SO DERPY AND EPIC AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH! I RECCOMEND IT TO PEOPLE WHO LIKE RAINBOWS AND STARS AND GUNS AND NPCS AND CARS AND WATER AND PLAYING FUN GMOD!
BurdLord;-;Pretentious Simulator 2015: Become an "Artistic" fandom screenshot maker, and have thousands of fangirls for your artistry. Great path if you just want to mess around and publish screenshots as artwork. OR Climb the ranks of adminship, to uncover the corrupt nature of the playerbase, and expose their wrongdoings without becoming banned or one yourself. With a gripping storyline of drama and a cast of wonderful badmins, this is the best route Storytelling Wise.
-(|RG-O|)- Radioactiveboy;-;3486 Hours of my life gone. It's taken me this long to realize I may be addicted.
Stawri;-;OVER 9000/10. Its that amazing.
Zero-One;-;What can I say? Amazing sandbox game with unlimited possiblities on end. Become this, do that, destroy this, build that, kill him, resurrect her, do whatever you wish. Most immersive sandbox game I have played in awhile. Add on the fact with all the Steam Workshop Mods, as well as FacePunch Forum Mods, this game is neverending with new things to discover, and new things to build. Great thing is, you don't have to do it alone. By default, there are two gamemodes, sandbox, and TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) where it goes from building to proving the guilty, proving your innocence, or even killing ever last living soul. Would play again.
[FD] [FC&N] Spike;-;This game has many gamemodes roleplay, sandbox, hunger games and lots more! This game also has all kinds of mods like wiremod for making confusing stuff, weapons npc's, tools, dupes and way more! This game is mostly about building and fighting. I recommend u play this game!
Nikolai MacPootislavomanikovski;-;a game with endless ways to screw around. the downside is that the community can consist of 5 - 14 year olds that either ruin the experience of others, or spam five nights at freddies dupes.
Battler Torchic;-;it is cool

Liza226;-;one of the best games on steam ^^
Fullskill;-;You play this game over 1000 hours = You learn every law of Gaben physics.
Damo2021;-;One of the best sandbox games ever made
Tek;-;In all honesty the factor that you even have to read the reviews to decide whether or not to purchase this game is suprising to me. This is one of, if not the most amazing game I have ever played. It is quite difficult to explain what this game is, but the best I could say is it is a game that works as a basis for games to be created and played on. So right now you may be thinking your not a fan of these creator, non story line based games. But G-Mod is so much more than that, it's a community of people who absolutley love to play and create things together. It is a community of individuals who enjoy coming together to create something that I have never seen done in a game before. And so much more, I can't explain every "Game Mode" in G-Mod, but let me just throw a few out there. One being a little game called "Trouble in Terrorist Town", probably the most fascinating and enjoyable FPS game I have ever played, then there is the likes of "Prop Hunt" a truely wonderful little Game Mode that is really one of the first Hide n' Seek type games I have ever seen work well. But these are just 2 of the big Game Modes in Garry's Mod, there are so many other Game Modes that may not have the same recognititon as the ones I have discussed, but have the same wonderful communities. This truely is a game where you come together with others in order to just have a good time and enjoy simply playing the game. I have never had a game where I have made so many friendships with individuals who simply enjoy the same random little game mode I do. To ignore G-Mod and to blow it off as just another "creation/god" game is criminal to say the least. So if by now you haven't already pick up the damn game, do it; and join in on a one of a kind gaming experience.
xRoxy;-;Got killed by hitting my leg on a chair, I'd say worth the money 10/10
Lunatic Princess Near;-;Hillarious. OH MY GOD. I have had so much fun so far on the different game-modes on different servers. My favorite is "Murder" mode. Amazing. Your sides aren't safe from laughter injuries when playing this game, unless you are a grumpy-cat. Anything is possible with garry's mod! ANYTHING :D Office chair races, Wagon rockets, zombie apocalypses, melon fights, nyan cat cannons, bouncing concrete, running around as a bag of doritos, seeing vocaloid len get murdered horribly, fluttershy jumping out a window, flying in a dune buggy, and the purge.
Cian;-;This game is a must have , this game is worth it for just TTT plus there are other game modes.
Kaleidescoop;-;Madness in a nutshell. Definitely worth it. Nuff' said.
Pheebs;-;I totally recommened this game (Garry's Mod), it has a wide range of different games on it alone and you'll never get bored of it. It's a thumbs up from me!
Mwcie mi Kajtek;-;Garry's Mod is a modification for a Source Engine which gets you ability to create, destroy, build, connect, guide, fight, pose, construct, and mess around. You can do crearly ANYTHING. Gameplay On a spawn, you've got a set of standard weapons for HL2 (crowbar, gravity gun, pistol, 357, smg, ar2, shotgun, crossbow, rpg, grenade) and a special Physics Gun, which makes you able to manipulate props, people and whatever. You can spawn content from all (installed) Source Games and even download custom models/maps/sounds/saves/weapons/etc from a Steam Workshop. Playing multiplayer is as fun as playing alone. Crazy addons makes it even more fun! Multiplayer Well, its more fun than singleplayer - I just lied to you, sorry. In multiplayer you can't only build with people.. you can play random gamemodes like Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town or Cinema! You can be a prop and hide from everyone; you can be a terrorist and act like a innocent man; you can watch YouTube videos with everyone... there are even gamemodes for racing and talking in public! Workshop It gives you very big ability to download and share your creations with others. Like I said: files/maps/models/textures/sounds/npcs/vehicles/helicopters/weapons and much much more makes you spend 15hours a day in a freakin Gmod. So... GMod is one of the most creative games I've ever played. Nothing more to say - this game is worth its price. 9.5/10
RIP;-;If you play Team Fortress 2, Portal, Half Life, or any other valve game, THIS IS FOR YOU. So many ing addons! Tons of fun! A game from 2006 is better than CoD: Ghosts or B4! Must get. 9/10
Space Butterfly;-;If you dont have it, get it. Really though get it.
Dubwub[Galaxy];-;Very good game and i recomend this to all
Majmij;-;Buy this game. Even if you've never heard of it. Even if you can't afford it. Even if you're not a PC gamer. Even if you don't play games. Even if you don't have a PC. Even if you don't want to. Even if you're an animal. Even if you're a fruit. Even if you're a veggie. Even if you're an alien. Even if you don't exist. Buy this game.
progunxzx;-;Huge replay value... must buy for any pc gamer
The Dinkle Burger;-;Filled map with all the teletubbies, no two were the same color or shade. Then i got abuducted by an orange Tom Swanson "9/11 would Michael Bay again" -Nintendo Power Magazine
Battler Torchic;-;it is cool
Nikolai MacPootislavomanikovski;-;a game with endless ways to screw around. the downside is that the community can consist of 5 - 14 year olds that either ruin the experience of others, or spam five nights at freddies dupes.
Umbra;-;This game is great. This is how it usually goes down.. "You RDM'ed me you hax0r. Ban him!" says the little kid "Oh no! I have to keep my reputation with little kids to make me feel better about myself" The Admin thought to himelf. You are banned for RDMing. "Welp, time to go to a new server I guess, because it's not like there are thousands of other TTT servers to go on...."
Are You Feeling It Now;-;Garry's mod makes buying hundreds of games obsolete, anything you could dream of, exists on the steam workshop. If you have even the slightest creative streak in you (and 10$ USD) then you should buy this game, 10/10-IGN.
Spaceman;-;Constructing in this game is full of fun, and enormous amount of game modes makes Garry's Mod a nice place to spend an evening.
snarkel;-;Best game for messing around Best game for making a stopmotion Best game for making a machinima Best game for playing prophund Best game for making desktop wallapapers Best game for playing rp Best game for bulding Best game for getting a good laugh
kaki -;-;kleiner stole my grotesque meat baby 10/10
WonderfulPlums;-;Great game, unlimited possibilities 10/10 would buy;)
The Orcaman;-;Why spend hundreds of dollars on a ton of videogames... ...when you can get them all for $10 bucks?
That Fucking Pervert;-;15/10 wow much fizzicks very amused much fps so source wow
Turtle;-;This game honestly can't truthly be rated as a whole. As there are so many gamemodes always out there that it would take so long to try out each one and and gather an opinion on it. I do however enjoy this game, as there are always new things to try different servers with different things so not even the gamemodes servers themselves the same. As it is always changing and when you play the game you can never know what to expect. I highly recommend this game, the community can be awesome on this game it always depends on the server. I hope you all have as much fun as I am.
TheJerkoe;-;ERROR Missing texture Missing addon Missing map 10/10
Mr.Tent Mc'Sassy;-;Garry's Mod is an amazing game. No matter how long you play, you can always find something new on the workshop to mess around with. Many mods to try out and game modes. Furthermore you can use the props and tools to make basically anything. There isn't many games where you can place down a portal in front of you and behind you and throw a brick in to the portal. The brick then hits you causing you to ragdoll and fly throw the portals continuously. 10/10 would throw brick in to the portal again.
No;-;Garry's Mod. Lots of fun.. But you have to use your creativity. I wouldn't recommend this game if your soul is a potato.
BloodySkelly;-;Killed a Moderator in a zombie server. I got kicked out XD 11/10 You should get this game :) DAMN ITS GOOOOD!
Vik;-;Garry's Mod is a game where if you took 10 people and asked them about their experience on it you would get 10 different answers. The community, addons, workshop and gamemode you choose to play will determine your experience not to mention the ability to create your own gamemodes, addons and community... It allows control to finally rest with the player as long as they are willing to learn LUA, scripting and other forms of basic programming. Rarely does a game teach me new skills while also imporving old ones and giving me the freedom to do whatever I feel. Despite the trolls, I wouldn't trade being able to run my own server and custom gamemode for anything. The schema's for roleplay such as ClockWork and NutScript as well are impressive and a well run RP server is the last forefront of serious roleplay on the internet. Thank you Garry for setting the sky as the limit and to Valve for allowing us to have all the Source Engine as our playground.
Liza226;-;one of the best games on steam ^^
Fullskill;-;You play this game over 1000 hours = You learn every law of Gaben physics.
Singularity  #roadto4bit;-;ts a really cool game definetly creative world and imperessive creative workshops. Multiplaye Playable Mods f you got friends you "should" buy garrys mod totaly you can do everything with your friend and drive cars , drive planes, fight with counter-strike weapons. "Everything possible in Garry's Mod" I saw a guy who made  And I saw a guy who build balls Thats a team work right!!
best-3000;-;Imagine a Sandbox, but instead of sand you got dolls and guns (actually a lot more than those 2). In a better perspective it's still a sandbox game without sand and what to put it in the "sandbox" is in your command. The power of lua simply drives this game forward with a lot of gamemodes more than just putting doll in a doll house or rather you becoming a doll having a gun shooting another doll that is your friend or...someone else in a public game. Have a crazy random idea about something? Put it in this game. Wanted to have a game that does not limit what you can do? This is the game. Want to create 3D animation without a complex expensive software? This is the program. Want to get money by writing a couple lines of code that turns out to be a epic game inside a game? This is how you get them. Garry's Mod let you create your own sandbox with 0% mess, and it's cooler inside (the house).
Vladmir Reed;-;This game brings joy and love to all. With an infinite amount of things possible, what's wrong with this game? Aside from the Garry's Mod 13 update, the ragdoll bugs, sound bugs, and fire bugs. Not to mention that weird sound of water when you spawn. To be honest, that's not a whole lot of things. Now I'm done ing, on to what's good with the game. First off. The Steam Workshop. This makes life easy for players to just download and play. And you have a mega s*** ton of weapons, maps, game modes, dupications, weapons, NPCs, and much more. If you don't at least think this game seems interesting, you need help. It's fairly easy to get started. Having trouble with a nonstop zombie noise screaming at you when you are 150% sure you deleted everything on the map? Go into your console and fix that, you see? Half of the things wrong with this game are gone. Mind you, this game is only $10. Get it. It's fun. You feel that sandbox is boring? You want to play with someone on a server? Play the many game modes shown in the server menu. If you want to be a Traitor on your best freind, play the mode; Trouble in Terrorist town. Feel like you miss Half-Life 2 due to the Source engine Garry's Mod uses? Play HL2:RP. Want to just kick it and watch some things with complete strangers? Yes. You can go to the movies in Garry's Mod. I want you to buy this game and forward the cause of science by 40 years. Thank you for your time.
Nexton;-;Best game I've ever played. I've spent over 3000 hours on it and so have others. There's no way you'll ever get tired of it due to its many gamemodes and possibilities.
Frost;-;Its a really fun game you can make pics or videos even Roleplaying!
Gabriel;-;This game is awesome. But not that kind of awesome. I mean, as in maybe too much. Garry's Mod is a sandbox game that requires, REQUIRES your imagination. And boy, when it says the game will never end, they mean it! There's so much to do, as in almost no limit. To know what I mean, just get the game. Though in the past, and still sometimes today, it's created to make entertaining videos, it has evolved to become an all-out fun game. Just like Minecraft started out as an experiment into, well, you know.... I highly recommmend this game to sandbox lovers and shooter lovers alike, but just as a tiny negative I have and, well, seeing as how I love actual GOALS in games (that MAKES it a game, doesnt it?), I would like Garry's Mod to have some sort of goal, or optional ending to it, and seeing how this is technically the trillionth time anyone has asked for a story mode in this game, that's pretty much not a big deal, anyways. I love this game, and I highly reccommend it. 9.5/10.
Bloopers;-;Best game I've ever played!
RandomBull406;-;Great game, it's really fun to play, 19/10!
SoulessW;-;i love that game

[CCG] CyberPwn;-;This game is an open Sandbox so you make the game how you want it to be. I thought i would share a few points: - You don't need a awesome PC to run it. - The ragdoll feature is amazing if you dont put them in place propley they might just fly out of the map! - The gravity gun from Half-life is upgraded to THE PYPICS GUN which is also awesome! - Cars to rideable Dogs there are laods of vericals ready to be downloaded with one click! - You can also downlode maps, gamemodes, weapons, Balls and other things real people have made half way across the world! - There is so much fun to have in this game it great! -There is also a muiltiplayer Feature!
The Dinkle Burger;-;Filled map with all the teletubbies, no two were the same color or shade. Then i got abuducted by an orange Tom Swanson "9/11 would Michael Bay again" -Nintendo Power Magazine
Wolfsitize;-;Trouble In Terrorist Town (game mode) is probably one of the most addicting things I have ever played.
satan;-;A fun sandbox game that got me into Steam in the first place, I've played waaaaay too much of this game. 10/10
Doc. Sarcastic;-;Personal Rating: 9/10 What is there to say about Garry's Mod, it's a creativity tool for starters. It has a wide community ranging from Terrorists to Homeless People and all in all I have great fun messing around and throwing couches at people. The amount of servers and variety here is truly amazing, for example, one minute you could be roleplaying as a chef in Germany, switch to another server and boom, you're a Terrorist. The workshop is magnificent too, I mean, the amount of stuff on there is amazing. The only problem I have is I can't play single player. Seen as though when GMOD switched to GMOD 13, it changed files. So, that means you would have to disable then enable all of your addons. Bit of a problem for me seeing as though I have 25+ pages of addons and the amount you get when connecting to servers is huge. One last note, buy the Counter Strike/GMOD pack, maybe 90% of maps and props used on servers have Counter Strike on it, the other 10% is Half Life 2, Episode 1 and Episode 2 so be careful.
the fucking best name ever;-;This game is amazing and with CSS (Coutner Strike Source) you get an unlimated supply of gamemodes to choose from! Download tons of really awesome mods and addons to make the game even more fun! Play with your friends on servers/Hamachi! This game deserves 20/10 from me. This game has no limits! Get this game when it's on sale, and you'll save a lot of money. Who am I kidding, you can't wait, BUY IT NOW! >:D 2000+ hours, of course I love it! 10/10
[NnG] PonderousClock2;-;Very good game! Many gamemodes, doesn't matter if you wanna detect crime( Trouble in Terrorist Town) Wanna get money n'  (DarkRP) or just buil stuff(Sandbox)! Garry's mod is the game for you!
Snipe2Die;-;Cool game, alot of gamemodes, alot of fun, alot of players. This game have to be recommended!
Metal Is Gone 10 Days;-;This game lets you do anything, and I DO mean ANYTHING! It has Gun, Knives, and Bananas and Melons...What else is needed? 11/10 Would Crash it again! <3
Shy!;-;If you look at my profile you will AKA WILL!!! see that my profile pic is made by me by using the same thing you are reading about right now............no,no not TF2 dummy Gmod 13! (Garry's Mod 13 as you will) is a game with no end, no objective and absolutely no point howeverrrrrr you CAN make a point you CAN make an end and you CAN make an objective all by using the things the game supply you with/chuck in your face and say "Here you go now DO A THING!!" orrrrrrr you can just make EPIC PICTURES (like me) and post them for ALL OF STEAM TO SEE!!!! (theres a way to upload them to facebook aswell!) Also you can play multiplayer! (duuuh) theres alsorts of things to do rather then just building a fully destructible building or killing random NPCs with a boombox by playing THE WOST MUSIC EVER!! you can play game modes like prop hunt, RD (Role Play) ,stop it slender!, zombie survival or the famous TTT (trouble in terrorist town) and many MANY MORE! the only downside to this game is the fact that you need HL2 (and all its eps) to play and you need CSS (counter strike source) to play most of the game modes or you will get the dreaded ERRORS lucky you can get things that will stop this or just get the games! so if your looking for something to de-stress yourself with instead Kittens then Gmod is there! (unless your building a giant robot...then it is not...)

Metal Is Gone 10 Days;-;This game lets you do anything, and I DO mean ANYTHING! It has Gun, Knives, and Bananas and Melons...What else is needed? 11/10 Would Crash it again! <3
Something Unknown;-;Garrysmod has been with me since the beginning of 2014, and it has been a great game to play. You can go on servers and socialize with others and get to make good friends, I had made already 6 new friends this year alone (2014) just playing Garrysmod. You can also add addons to make the game even more fun for you, which you can use in Singplayer but also servers might have the addons you have so you can play with others using those fun addons! Also you can make Pacs which mean Player Appearance Customizer, using this tool, you can make a great appearance for yourself which can wow others. Also there are gamemodes you can use such as Murder which are fun because if it was just only Sandbox which is like a gamemode in which you make things and just hangout it would be boring but with these other gamemodes such as Murder it makes the game very fun. Even though there are some downfalls such as people being rude and things just try to ignore it and have fun doing what you want to do.
Snipe2Die;-;Cool game, alot of gamemodes, alot of fun, alot of players. This game have to be recommended!
ORANGE CHICKEN;-;I saw a guy spray a picture of a naked pony on the wall. 9/10

_Mr_Spy_Crab_ | RW;-;cool
BitTheBytes;-;One of the best sandbox games, along with Minecraft
Deku;-;The ultimate messing around game! :special:
Doc. Sarcastic;-;Personal Rating: 9/10 What is there to say about Garry's Mod, it's a creativity tool for starters. It has a wide community ranging from Terrorists to Homeless People and all in all I have great fun messing around and throwing couches at people. The amount of servers and variety here is truly amazing, for example, one minute you could be roleplaying as a chef in Germany, switch to another server and boom, you're a Terrorist. The workshop is magnificent too, I mean, the amount of stuff on there is amazing. The only problem I have is I can't play single player. Seen as though when GMOD switched to GMOD 13, it changed files. So, that means you would have to disable then enable all of your addons. Bit of a problem for me seeing as though I have 25+ pages of addons and the amount you get when connecting to servers is huge. One last note, buy the Counter Strike/GMOD pack, maybe 90% of maps and props used on servers have Counter Strike on it, the other 10% is Half Life 2, Episode 1 and Episode 2 so be careful.
Rom and Ram (White Sisters);-;Garry's Mod is all about fun and funny and more fun :3. There is a workshop to get stuff. The game has NPCs,Ragdolls,Guns :3, and props.

[IJWTB] Cake;-;If you don't own this game, you shouldn't be on Steam.
[AC] Vinyl Scratch;-;It's one of the best games for making custom gamemodes, making screenshots, and even sometimes movies. All in all, it's rater cool, i've made multiple screenshots with this, also, it has a massive community, most of which contribute to the GMod workshop.
SuperSonicFan411;-;like this game! hopefully it will have better tf2 ragdolls though (there is an addon for this, just hope it gets fixed in the real version)

GumballTheScout[Venice!];-;Best mod EVER! 10/10
[SCG] Diabeetus;-;There's two ways to end your life. 1. Commit Suicide 2. Play this game.
Jax;-;Do you like truly open sandbox games? Do you love mashing faces into the ground to release your inner self? Do you like to roleplay? How about doing 20 pounds of LSD while being hired for $2 to kill someone? If you said yes to any or all of these, (Which you did) then this is definitely the game for you. Featuring hundreds of separate game-modes and servers, you'll be able to find just about anything you're looking for. Anything from Half-Life 2 Roleplay to Sandbox, Garry's Mod has it. You can enter sandbox and pose an endless amount of ragdolls available on our Workshop in  poses, or you can enter a multiplayer, and do it ten times more with friends! You can join the infamous Dark RP and jump around in teleporting cars or selling gun shipments that nobody will buy unless you sell individually! You can enter the supreme master race world of HL2RP, with strict roleplaying rules that guarantees a long-lasting enjoyment. TL;DR! - Thousands of maps! - Thousands of player-models! - Hundreds of game-modes! - Hilariously cutting edge game-physics! - Thousands of ported models from several games! - Mothering theater! - Good luck getting the Real Garry achievement!

Titanium;-;This game is essential (must have) if you are a steam user!
Millerman;-;Garys Mod is the perfect game to pick up and play with some friends or by yourself, with all its game modes, mini-games and steam workshop support it is definitely worth the $10 price tag. I would and have recommended this to everyone as it is easy to pick up and there is so much you can do. Get Creative!
Dr.Robotniik;-;Played for over 800 hours. Now own server. Ruined life. 10/10
Maniax;-;this game is fun for almost everybody. you can get creative in sandbox mode, shoot your bullets in gun game, play bomberman, search for props, or even kill people. those are just some examples of what you can do. Play by yourself, or with friends, or even with total strangers! everything is possible in this game, and because there are thousands of user-created things in the workshop, this will never get bored. I recommend you to try it out for yourself. Maybe you dont like some of the minigames you can do, but there will always be that one game youll find it worth the money!
Erectile Reptile;-;OMG I LOVE THIS GAME, its a sandbox game with easy modablility, one of the best things is, its a low RAM requiring game, so even the worst of computers can run it. a must-have on steam. 9/10

Jasperpa;-;This game is amazing. It almost never gets old. There's something for everyone. Like killing hordes of zombies? Do it. Like building giant contraptions? Do it. Like creating items or weapons for games? Do it. Like taking character from different games and putting them together into one scene? Do it. Like ultra-realistic graphics to take sweet pictures with? Do it. There is so much you can do with this game, that it would be impossible to list them all. With just the vanilla game, things CAN get old. But that's no reason to go and hate it. Mods are very easy to find, and even easier now with the newly implemented Garry's Mod Workshop on Steam, which is the only place you can get the game. You don't even need to own Half-Life 2 to play it. It's built in. So it's basically an entirely different game all on it's own. The is singleplayer for when you don't want to run the risk of idiots coming on your server and screwing everything up, and there's also multiplayer for when you want to show off your work or play with friends. This game is worth much more than it costs. Get it. You will not regret it. Even if you are into COD. Plus, it doesn't require a very powerful machine to run. I believe it can run on Windows 2000.

CatXlina;-;Great game for free play, multiplayer, and has TONS of things to do. Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Sandbox, and a lot more. Worth the download wait and money.
Heisenberg;-;Garry's Mod, this is one of the best games known to man. Consisting of many different servers and games you can play, you'll never want to stop playing this game! Unfortunately there is some problems with this game, for starters, some of the textures won't load and you have to download some to make the textures come back. Without downloading these textures that server/game is glitchy. Also, when joining a server, it takes a very long time. But overall, I highly recommend this game!
[SUGOI]Repo Mann;-;Please........let me leave it.....I am stuck in it for YEARS! I ALREADY miss the old times when there were not so much E2 zombies, when somebody actualyy BUILT something instead of coding a new hat or weapon of mass destruction.... This game is good, too good to be still alive.
Acer Thy Racer;-;What are you waiting for? This is the best sandbox/gamemode/what-ever-the-crap-you-want-it-to-be game of all time!

jew king of africa;-;It's an interesting game. It will require a lot of harddrive space as there are lots of addons and you have to download more when joining many servers. I have lots of time in the game from just screwing around in DarkRP. The game has lots of gamemodes but most get little attention as the game is mostly spammed with terrible DarkRP and TTT servers. Garry's Mod server admins are some of the worst people I've ever played with in games. When you do find a good DarkRP or TTT server it can be very fun to play. I'd overall give the game a 7/10.
jujubemaster;-;You like denying the laws of physics? Perfect Game for you!
P20;-;...what now?
Uncle MLG Rakata;-;Ayyyy... this game makes me dream about cheese sometimes so dat's a plus, but other times there's weeaboos. Garry's mod is a sandbox game that teaches children about the importance of fan fiction. No matter how salty it may be, they're all dank. Slapping people is fun. Sleep deprivation is a giant plus. 8/8 would r8 again no b8 m8. There's also superb memes from the tips of mens' fedoras.
A Cat Loli;-;I may have lost my job, my house, my family, my friends, my dog, and even my hair, but at least I have my Garry`s Mod...

Ducko_DShot;-;good but raily had to make stuff but good for modes like jailbrake
Haboob;-;Who needs a life when you can have Garry's Mod
Dongol the Destroyer;-;Garry's Mod is the best sandbox game ever. You can do anything in it, from building in sandbox to messing around in other gamemodes made by the community. Garry's Mod itself can be boring but it will never get boring with the all of the addons made by the community. You can do anything you can imagine, you can download a roller coaster save in a map & have fun in it with friends, you can survive zombie hordes in zombie survival gamemodes, you can watch videos with your friends in Cinema gamemode. It's so addicting & fun, Garry's Mod will never get boring as long as the workshop of it is alive. This game is pretty fun & funny with friends. It's fun while playing solo too. A must play for any gamer. Note - You'll most likely face a lot of texture errors (pink & black) & error signs in multiplayer because most servers use Counter-Strike: Source content. So it's recommended to buy the CS:S+GMod package/bundle. But if you don't have money, you can download the content for free. Recommended source games for the best experience in multiplayer : 1. Counter-Strike: Source 2. Half-Life 2 3. Half-Life 2 episode 1 & 2 Rating - 10/10.
[FNAD][Aimnot.exe]Engicop;-;A good game to mess around with faces in. [   ]
TINY;-;the worst game ever made
Insanity;-;Is Garry's Mod Right For You? The sandbox built on Half Life 2s game engine - has been rebuilt from scratch. The game turns Half Life 2 and Team Fortress 2, into a virtual construction kit. Originally based on the Valves Source engine, Garrys Mod has its own compatible rendering engine - ridding the module of many bugs and enabling it to be used without Half Life 2. Sandbox games give users control over virtual worlds. In Minecrafts case, builders have blocks composed of different elements that enable them to craft landscapes and create buildings. In Garrys Mod, the elements are determined by the entities and maps extracted from HL2 and TF2. Play begins, in single player mode, with the selection of a map from either of those games. Hints are enabled automatically and a bubble will pop up urging you to press and hold Q on your keyboard. This opens a dialogue full of game elements, from none-player characters (NPCs) to weapons and furniture. The main attraction of Garrys Mod is the realistic simulation of physics in a virtual world When you place items in the maps, you have two special weapons to manipulate the world. The Physics Gun enables you to pick up and move items. Its a multipurpose tool that, when used with NPCs, allows you to position their limbs and bodies and then freeze them into place. The second special weapon is the Tool Gun , which is actually a number of different weapons all rolled into one. You can select what the Tool Gun does by selecting Q and choosing a function. This turns Garrys Mod from a dolls playhouse into a full construction set, with settings that enable you to create motors, winches, elastic ropes and more. The Tool Gun can also be used to finely tune the positioning of NPCs, with face, eye and finger posers. How you actually use Garrys Mod is up to you. Some build impossible structures, others create new games from the building blocks provided. A key, emerging use is virtual photography - screenshots capturing action that would be impossible to snap during the cut and thrust of a normal game. Like the Valve games that Garrys Mod was built on, it can be expanded. The Steam Workshop features additional tools and game modes, models and maps that you can download and use with Garrys Mod. Theres a multiplayer mode too - just like Half Life 2. The number of different game types in this mode is a testament to the inventiveness of the community. There are role-playing servers, zombie survival games, capture the flag, collaborative building servers, racing games... The list goes on and on.

TVR | Cyvox;-;Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions You can go on servers with different gamemodes its amazing.

This game has that every 2 seconds. Expands creativity, has lots of community addons, playermodels, all that kinda stuff. Wanna make a stop motion movie but you suck at SFM? Try Gmod. Wanna just hang out with friends but you got no game to do so? Try Gmod. Oh but what are you saying? You don't have any friends? Worry not! There are plenty of online servers to choose from, ranging from Sandbox to community game mods like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prophunt, Murder, Stop it Slender! and even Jailbreak! Building is very advanced and you can do all kinds of cool stuff. Even a driveable bathtub. I'm serious. Truly a master piece of a game.
Brightness -BUYING TRADING CARDS;-;Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. The game's makers give you the tools and leave you to play! You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions -- whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet -- that's up to you. If you're not too great at construction -- don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions.
chaining a shiny zangoose;-;You can build giant flying , what's not to like?
Xx_Gamer_Grill_xX;-;I went here with my nakama (that means "friend" in Japanese) the other day. I asked for ramen but they didn't have it so me and my nakama had to eat this weird cold fish stuff instead. We came for Japan food but ended up having to eat some fish thing that's probably French or something. It doesn't matter though because we could see Naruto-sama everywhere we looked and we could shout "Dattebayo" (that means "Habeeb it!" in Japanese) and everyone knew what we meant.
Nightimzbysmurf;-;Garry's mod is a game based from half life, counter stike etc. within the game there are numerous gamemodes. (The most popular being trouble in terroist town, also known as ttt.) It is very enjoyable and as there is nearly always something for everyone, it is one of the most popular games on steam. i think everyone should give this a try and if you are not sure just wait till a steam sale. At some point it nealy always is. other gamemodes include Prop Hunt, Murder, Stop it slender, and many more. If there is still doubt as to whther to get this game or not. Check the channel of Seanners who has become one of the most popular youtubers in the world for his daily gaming videos ( mainly of gamemodes within Garry's mod)
Mr. Wrighty;-;This is the only best thing for me to make my machinimas at Source Engine
Falixia  #afk4raya;-;Finding a cheap game? Well this game you've been searching for. With plenty of gamemodes, this game is really fun. You can build anything that you can imagine. 9/10
=[RG]= Slappy;-;Get this game, no questions asked you can have thousands of hours fun with this game
The Freeman;-;Limitless possibilities, it's almost impossible for you not to find something you enjoy.
harch bech;-;Haven't played it that much, but I guess it's good game. I'm still a beginner though.
=[RG]= Slappy;-;Get this game, no questions asked you can have thousands of hours fun with this game
Mr. uLLeticaL;-;The ultimate physics sandbox, running on the HL2 engine. This game has multiple game modes within the game, sandbox, roleplay, racing, spacebuild, trouble in terrorist town and many more game modes to try and play.
Sll cl;-;I ing hate this game.
Sarah;-;Well, there's 700 hours of my life I'm never gonna get back. It's a really good game when you find a good community & ignore the lil es. A good 698 hours have been spent on TTT so I don't really know about the other game modes. 10/10 would waste more hours.
TOXIC;-;THIS GAME MAKES ME ROCK SOLID.
Bamanboi;-;I absolutely hate it, worst game I've ever played. Good thing I didn't waste a lot of time playing this piece of garbage.
Dankiel;-;it's ok
Latt;-;Nice game :3
HL$tP!L | #RiPTitan;-;Want to buy Garry's Mod but dont want to pay full price? Im selling Garry's Mod for 2 Counter Strike Global Offensive keys. Add me if your interested

Celtic Batman;-;Before there was Goat SIm, there was Garry's Mod. How many crazy things can you do with Half-Life 2? Apparently its almost infinite. 5/10
Kopz!!!;-;EDIT: I'm still keeping this, mainly because Garry is an , in general AND to his own fanbase. (Not to mention this mod still has the most obnoxious community ever.) Seriously, you'd support paid mods for a game (which is, technically, a mod) that REVOLVES around mods? Get out of here. - Paid mods? No thanks.
caliboyjosh10;-;So lame you need to own another game for a game that cost money. What I liked: Lots of different gamemodes you can't get anywhere else What You Need to Know: Don't know how to play any mode Read you need to own counter strike source to get rid of texture errors It's a game where you make your own fun, but has gamemodes if you don't Seems like alot of kids play this game, NO SERIOUSLY ITS ALL KIDS!! GOD DAMN KIDS ARE SO ANNOYING!!! My Score: C Paid: $3 Completed in: ?
TITOMOSQUITO187;-;Meh..best marketed thing on Steam. Gotta hand it to the developers though. Making millions off the Steam Workshop and Valve for their marketing prowess with this game. If you don't feel like reading a bunch of BS about how to use this MOD, then don't bother buying it. You're just  away money on something you don't understand, and didn't look into before you bought it. Don't buy it just becaue EVERYONE else owns it. They only own it because Valve has marketed the ever loving s*** out of it and everyone just bought it at some point because you can't go anywhere without seeing it on sale. Don't forget to buy the other 15 gmaes you need to play most of the crap on here to sling racist terms around with 12 year olds and throw turds around. :)
Deverter;-;For many people this game is like few games (gamemodes) created by community packed into one game. For me only true potential of this game is sandbox, but not the vanilla one, because there's nothing to do without any modifications. At first you should take a look at Wiremod, most basic and commonly known addon.
Purple;-;I haven't played it that much, but I had fun while doing it.
Ducky Canard;-;It's Ok
Helix.;-;Well made, very creative.
The Batman;-;The best game ever if you stumble onto the Browntown TTT servers!
Asleep And Adrift;-;Great game giving lots of opportunities to do whatever you want :)
MR SQUIRREL;-;A must have on Steam. Endless ways to have fun. To those who don't own it, think of this as 1,000 mini games in one game. All of the gamemodes make you feel like your steam library is full to the rim with games. There is so many things to do and try. Give this game a shot, you won't regret it. 5 out of 5 Acorns.
Jason Farley;-;My favourite game without a single doubt in my mind, this game follows my sense of logic.
Nope.avi;-;This game i gotta say the best sandbox game there ever is! This sandbox game allows you to make any creation or any form of art like posing ragdolls and taking a screen shots of them! This game is very creative i highly recommend this game if you want to create.
Shoween;-;A good game for creative people, with lot's of variety in gamemodes... For the less creative people...
RIP MY NEWTON'S CRADLE;-;When I first bought the game, I didn't realize how good it was and left it to be just another un-used game on my library. I'm starting to play it a lot. You don't belong on Steam if you don't have this game.
Blaze;-;Just... play.
[FL:DJ] [F.I] Doctor Internet;-;As someone who has played over 3000 hours of GMod, and having bought it back in the GMod 12 version, I can talk about both versions. Prior the game did have some game-breaking bugs, sometimes suffered from other issues, such as frame-rate or stack overflow. However, the update to GMod 13 did fix most of these, however I do at times suffer from random crashing. Despite this I tend to enjoy it as a sandbox game, with the ability to smack around ragdolls for hours at a time does provide some release from the world. As much as I would like to say that the update to GMod 13 fixed all the problems, it didn't. However, it did do a good job at fixing most of them, thus I would recommend this game, just if not for future premis.
Kyuuru;-;Fun and entertaining. Easy to troll and grief if you're bored. It's worth to get.
Lord Franko;-;Every time I play gmod and get off. I have the urge to prop kill in real life. Gmod unleashes the troll in you! In other words you should buy it!
Serpa;-;This is a must have game. Get it.
Dongerlord;-;garrys mod is a very creative game more creative than others thats right im looking at you modern military shooters you can do whatever you heart desires and with the steam workshop there is endless creativity and endless updates to your game. not the game its your game you decide what you want to do if your not the creative person you can set up npcs to shoot or whatever anyhoo 10/10
=T$E=PS;-;Garry'sMod Has 9 Letters... nine ... Nine has 4 Letters 9-4 =5 five five has 4 Letters.... 5-4 =1 1..... THe illuminateh has 1 eye... 1+1=2 2 is a number ... 3 comes after 2.... 3 .... the triangle has 3 Sides..... the illuminati has 3 sides... ILLUMINATI Confirmed !! xD
Commander Somebody;-;this is a amazing sandbox style game with 1000's of mods, and there is even multiple game modes. if you like shooting, building, or programming mods, this is the game for you. not to mention, thousands and thousands of people play gmod.
T.W;-;Simply , BEST . GAME . EVER
^5Sparkly Something;-;this game is pretty much EVERYTHING! in a tube! you can roleplay and  or you can build random crap that is most likely not gona look good. but if youre like one of thosse smart massses! then i guess you can make pretty clever things with this. but ANYWHOI!!!! BUY THIS :D....!
{H.O.L} Hall of Lame;-;Too much of this game keeps you addicted, addicted so much that it is possible for you to become socially inadequate a few million years and miss the rise and fall of the apes. Too little of this game will leave you socially adequate but have nothing to talk about during the times you talk to your friends. I prefer to stay inbetween those two.
Solar Lunar;-;Like minigames, Get Gmod Like PVP GAMES, Get Gmod Like Rp games, Get Gmod Like Firstman-shooter, get Gmod Like thirdman-Shooter, Get Gmod Like MLP, Get Gmod Hate Mlp, Get Gmod If you want this, pay or force someone to get it for you, if you get in trouble... well, gg maybe next time!
Zekken;-;lol it has guns in it like call of dooty
~*~spaghetti and meatballs~*~;-;- A splendid and enjoyable game to play. - A large variety of impressive game modes to play in. - Fascinating game play and extremely pleasant building techniques. - Multiple add ons that are genius and majorly productive. - A broad community which makes the gameplay much more interesting; and entertaining. I suggest this game to majorly most gamers - this is a fantastic and entertaining game to play and is somehow addictive in a unique way - have fun.
pattycoombe;-;Really good game. Love it
Alex;-;Garry's Mod is a social experiment of what would happen if you give children infinite power and let them run the world and everything went horribly wrong. No seriously buy the game and head to a DARK RP server it's complete chaos filled with  jokes and tears. In all seriousness though parents if you wanna see how bad of a parent you are buy this game for you son/daughter and while they play it listen in to what they're doing odds are you'll get an accurate repersentation of what kind of person they are going to become. Get other parents involved too! compare who is the better parent and see who wins, because odds are if this sounds like a good idea you probably a  parent so why not turn it into a competion with the other  parents in your neighborhood.
Alex;-;Warning - This review is heavily LUA modding based Once you think you've done everything in the game - Played all the gamemodes and tried all the best mods then I definitely recommend learning to mod the game. Trust me. If you think you've done everything, this opens so many new doors. The ability to make whatever the hell you want. Then once you get good enough you get a great sense of achievement as well as basic knowledge within general programming. I recommend the game itself without the whole modding part anyway. I just personally think it expands the game vastly making it for myself more enjoyable. Even if you're not into programming, this will sure as hell get you into it once you learn the basics. If you're interested follow either/both of these links: Getting Started LUA Tutorials (better for newer programmers who are new to the concept of documentation and want to know all the basic things): Garry's Mod Maurits - LUA Tutorials [maurits.tv] More Advanced LUA Tutorials (contains all the pre-made functions and hooks within the game and how to apply them in a very basic fashion, but is good if you understand general programming and how to read documentation): Official Garry's Mod LUA Modding Tutorials [wiki.garrysmod.com] (May I just finally add, I'm not overly great at the whole modding concept, but I enjoy it and that's all that counts and the reason I'll continue to improve myself within it) Any questions about this - add me here on steam and I'll be happy to give you a hand if you're looking to get started. But as I said, I don't want to promise anything good from myself. But I'll look to help.
Spoonz4free;-;i really like it because you can build,fight,etc many other things i cant describe about this game are all good nothing bad.
K^;-;A very popular game, which includes a variety of gamemodes to enjoy!
Repo_The_Filthy;-;Its a very fun game
Seor Antifreeze;-;its a game and its good (did this just for the badge)
[Aspire] Nucka_Tyler;-;DarkRP was made the game fun for me mainly
Emil;-;A timeless mod that gives you many game options very funny big community and never seen before gamemodes.
Shrapnel Effect;-;Very fun game to just have a laugh, with endless items from the workshop to make it even better from guns, NPC's, Character skins, Cars, anything really.. highly recommended. my only regret is not gettign it sooner
[MVG][FC][GLOW]ClockworkDragon.;-;I have spent so much time in this game; there is an enormous amount of possibilitys, Gmod is packed to the brim with a number of servers and game modes to keep you occupied for hours on end! Feel free to visit Flaming crystal which is the server I usually play on, it is a deathrun server (deathrun is a mode in which you have to get to the end of a course whilst doging the traps set off by a "death") the server has jukebox so you can choose music to put on and plenty of skins and trails. I have happily spent over a hundred hours in Gmod and I will carry on to play for a long time!
Awesomosupremeio;-;NOTHING gets much better than this 4568549/10 IGN
[UTUBER] DARFALL THE EPIC GAMER!;-;The ultimate multiplayer game which would make you play from mourning to night. Absolute worth every penny you have in all your pockets.
Damn it, MB;-;This game is fun. I love it, Its for someone who likes building shenanigans. Like me, or if your a fan of murder then Play the murder game mode, you have to avoid the killer. Anyways this game is alot of fun. I totally recommend it.
DavidP;-;11/10, With over 1300+ hours I cant say more than 11/10
GermanNarwhal;-;Just buy it... it dosen't need a proper expenation... just buy it... throw money at it...
KatNotDinner - ROAD TO NEW GPU;-;The best game I''ve ever played, been addicted to it for 3 or 4 years now. Inspired me to start programming. Definatelly worth a shot but keep in mind that you might not ge the point the first time you play it. You have to try multiplayer and try servers running different gamemodes to actually see how cool this game is. Are you a shooter fan? Good, you can make a great shootout with guns you download. You can also play shooter gamemodes like Green Shift. Like programming? Great, you can make addons and gamemodes for this game! Like building? There's the sandbox gamemode for you! Like solving a mystery? Hop on a TTT server and help the detective find out who the traitor is.. or is it you? There's something for everyone, you just have to spend some time looking around.
[mR] Axehacker32;-;A wonderful game! Lots of different gamemodes, all of them fun.
Doopy;-;If you think this game is all about trolling and making some strange contraption, you're wrong. This game has so much to it that the fun you can get out of this is endless! When you first jump into the game you'll see "Sandbox" as a gamemode. Sandbox is the base gamemode for the this game, but little do you know my friend. There are actually other gamemodes that make this a very outstanding game. There's Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), where the innocent terrorists must band together to discover who the traitor is and take him out. Whereas the traitor must silently eliminate each innocent without (hopefully) being known as the traitor. There's also Prop Hunt, where there are two sides to the game: The hunters, who must find and kill all props. And the props, who must hide from the hunters until the timer runs out. If nothing I've said so far has convinced you to buy this yet... You can pose ragdolls in sex positions to fill your dirty fantasies, you perverted sonava.
toxune;-;Best 10$ I have ever spent. Seriously this game is amazing.
Hammerhead;-;I've played this way too ing much
RIP Ping;-;Garry's is the best sandbox i ever played
Rainbow_Dinosaur;-;One of my fav games :)
Ironicorn;-;Think of minecraft, then shoot it in the head and stuff the dead body with valve crap. This is what you get.
Spudato;-;this game is awesome it's just complicated but awesome still it takes a while to get good at but is worth it.
Dr.Gamer;-;This is the best game I've ever played in my gaming life! :D Prop Hunt is my absolute favorite thing to do on this game! I can't describe how much I love Garry's Mod! Just buy this game! IT'S A DEFINITE MUST HAVE! You'll have alot of endless amount of fun! :D 100000000/10 Melons :D
Taxtronic Taxtro;-;Oh Sheet
[Saint] Jumbaco;-;Doing the dumb thing at the dumb time. This game is all about that. Buy it.
broken.....;-;well to start off it's a funny game with lot's of creativity but i dont find the online experience as good as say battlefield, Left 4 dead, and minecraft. I think the game is meant more for people who want to make small video games and movies. I do like however how they add TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) to the game allready so you dont have to download it :) But whoever thought of the idea to make this game i want to give them one big brofist :D
Nomadic Dog Lint;-;I laughed too much about shooting a watermelon 57.89/57.9
Derpina (   );-;Love this game. One of my favourites of all time because of the various things you can do. This is a must buy for and Steam user!
DJ PON3;-;Really Fun game you can find friends play different servers like deathrun and stuff cool addons :D

quack.;-;A great game, packed with fun gamemodes!
Radioactive Englishman;-;Can be used to make porn. 10/10 Will fap again.
Nachton;-;What a great sandbox game.. There is so much you can do from mods to just trying to build a robot out of random props. This game is swag in a basket!
GhostFigure;-;Awesome game, fun to play around in Singleplayer and messing with addons. Worth buying. ^_^
Bill Murray Enthusiast;-;get this
Mercykiller;-;To sum this game up shortly: It's a game where you can do anything. Be it shooting, RP, or creating something awesome. It covers a wide spectrum of game types.
EvilChaotic;-;I strongly recommend this game. Playing multi-player online, say playing "Stop It, Slender", "Prop-Hunt", "TTT", "Hide N Seek", and "Murder" will give you a nice thrill ride and even more experience as you play. You can even bring in your friends for even more fun and, like SeaNanners and myself, troll said friends in the game-modes you play in.
BIG BOSS;-;THIS GAME IS EPIC!!! I must say this game is a must buy if you are modder like me that loves modding games This is the game for you because the endless things you can do on this game is mind blowing! Mr Garry made Magic and that Magic is powerful :D
Coffeechipmunk;-;What is there to say about Garry's Mod. It's like 100 games in one, and it's fantastic. Will you bunny hop your way to victory, play detective in TTT and Murder, or hide for your life in Hide and Seek? Maybe, get dangerous and play some Deathrun as well. I highly suggest getting this game if you're on a tight budget, as it'll give you a lot for the price.
mario187Laflame;-;Excuse Me sir this is a mormon server I'm going to need you to refrain from using that language here.
Scrambled Bacon;-;A Physics SandBox game,create stuff like Rockets,Cars or Boats,anything,you can also download stuff in it's WorkShop. Only 9.99.

Prof. Sugarcube;-;Awesome. Just Awesome. This game has no limits (besides admins).
Mar7ochka;-;The game is very funny if you play with friends,the game have allots of gamemodes wich you can play
[YR Co-Owner] forkedpotato;-;Garry's Mod is a really fun game. It's an amazing game with no ending you can play Trouble in Terrorist Town,Stalker,Prop Hunt,Sandbox etc. It's worth the money and the downside is it takes up 2.0 GB
Orangemic;-;First I was like Garry is a nice guy, let's download his mod. Then I was like wow Garry needs to visit a metal hospital. But then I was like this is fun! And at last I was like, Garry's mod is my life.
Tequingue;-;This game is bootyful. 10/hamburger
I Don't Want To Go;-;Sleep....What is sleep....with this game sleep wont be necessary
BONES;-;This game is my favorite game ever. You can't get any better than this. The gamemodes are amazing and it is amazing for anj "old" game. I recommend this game highly.
Durlk;-;Stephen Hawking has the highest IQ I've ever seen for a chair
Blodmstare Cykelbiljett;-;its okay, havent played it that much though
JWonderchilds chubby OINK swag;-;Game of the millenium
Milqo;-;Garry's mod (Gmod) got a lot of differents gamemods to play with (like sandbox, zombie survival, prop hunt, TTT ...) so this game never end, you always find another way to play it. 8.5/10
Trhals;-;Great game if your looking for a great sandbox game to screw around and just spawn random item of mass distrution or just soliders to start a war. Plus there are build in addons, from guns that can shoot nyan cats (LOL) ,Call of Duty Black Ops weapons with almost all the details down to the bone ,and Minecraft blocks you can accually place. You can add the addons fast and easy. Eventhough the multiplayer is a bit slow (for me and alot of my friends) i'd still give this game 9/10, and highly suggest it!
73 ChrOMozones;-;one of the best games on steam
Koldraxon;-;You might not want to read this, so I've covered it with Spoiler. - Koldraxon, lord of the not-so-real Kal'eon Legion. 1: Despite some rather [minor inconvenient] downsides (everyone else says them, but those aren't an issue). This is a game, with games in it, with games in those games, with games in those games. Using models such as the Ceph from Crysis, Skeleton King from Dota, Lich King from Warcraft, and thousands of other not-so-well or well known characters, units, structures, vehicles, mechs, [end-of-world systems], and other intruging things... 2: This game shall never cease to exist as long as it has a community developing new, insane, things. Although I'm still waiting for Halo 4 Promethean models, admist many missing mechs, and other units, I quite enjoy making vehicles, giant machines (using other people's work, credited for indirect assistance), scenes, and comics (if I have the time or models). 3: I find only II drawbacks: It's not an MMO, if it was, we'd all be happily making/destroying/TERRAFORMING/invading-with-alien-things-such-as-Ceph/conquering/building empires/[insert your daily routine here]/socializing/[?]/[404]/[ERROR].Likelyhood that some servers have admins who may be "New zombie"s ((Halo Reach announcer)I haven't met these 'Badmins' yet). 4: I still have to find a server, sandbox with personal prop protection (toggle-able as a tool?), with all the models and mods I would need to help make rather glorious scenes. Other than that, I can make Kal'eon everywhere with this, until 'Metheans pop up, then I'll keep Kal'eon-ifying. When the Prometheans pop in, I'll make some vehicles for them, and label them -all- Promethean Order of Requiem forces, since 60% of Prometheans are M.I.A, the rest are either K.I.A or serving Covenant Remnant.
Uwe Boll;-;I played over hundreds of hours of this game.Why am i not board of it?Because of the workshop.With the workshop the game is endless fun.Multiplayer is Awesome.The game is worth it so you should try it.I played almost 400 hours and i'm not bored of it.The game is a masterpiece.But one bad problem with multiplayer.The People RDM you on darkrp.Sometimes they break the rules and admins do nothing.Other then that the game gets a 9/10
_ AMENO  _;-;Really fun game and reccomend it to anyone
fightmaster;-;its a source of endless humor. wether it be from putting ragdolls in positions you didn't think possible/legal, or constructing contraptions that are amazingly functional/cool with wiremod, I can promise you that with the constant addon production from the community will always leave you with something to do/explore. With or without other people. It also plays almost every other valve game's map, so scenery is also abundant.
kyjodi;-;great game very fun to play highly reccommended
Ketchup R Tillery |-/;-;430 hours... I don't play this game enough
kleavage;-;The game full of possibilities, its great. The gamemodes are great and its cheap and easy to get the hang of it!

Oldlenny;-;Melon party. nuf said
Father;-;So many things, in one game. Truly amazing.
Mr.Negi Generation 2;-;If you're gay as  like me, this is the game for you! In Garry's Mod, you can get into contact with Squeakers at the click of a button! If you want to have suicidal thoughts like me, you can easily join any donor admin DarkRP server and watch the abuse! I give this game 10/10 game of the year.
Gio;-;I think you do not get up in the morning, leave bathroom and open Garry's mod before even making a coffee if the game sucks. You do not make maps even if they are  or guides if the game sucks. You do not talk 24/7 about Garry's mod if the game sucks. 11/10 I started playing few days ago. One of the best games for really cheap price. Must buy!
TheSimonator;-;OMG this game is my altime favorite game in the whole universe and everywhere beyond it I cant beleive it is only 10 $ definetly worth your money you wont regret it ever until after the end of time.
soap soap (BRO PLAYING);-;Do I need to say anything? Just get it, play it, and have fun with your friends! No friends? It's ok... you can still play it.
30FPSKILL Reeves;-;Wow you will love this game it features almost all the valve charecters so you can play around with their dead bodies and build awesome creations
FaithfulAssassin;-;Everyone should own this game! It's freaking amazing xD

Mightylaz;-;Great game, got it a few weeks ago and already got loads of hours on record, recommend buying this as the possibilities are endless with the hundreds of addons and game modes. 8/10
Midget Arctic Foxxy;-;This game. I have put so many hours of my time into it mainly because of the communities I have been apart of. The actual game can get very boring. But it's the people there (besides the overall group of very annoying people/children who are very immature) that keep making me come back. I've loved most of my time in it because of them. I have met some very amazing friends who I hope I can have for a large portion of my life and yeah. 5/10 For the actual game 9/10 for the people that you can become friends with.
ConfusedCow;-;This game is AMAZING you can do almost everything with the right addons. You should definitly buy this game.
Nips Ahoy;-;If you have steam and you don't have Gmod, well, I can't really talk to you anymore.
slayer of nerd;-;It's for sweg muffins #LuvIt

olofm;-;Really nice game you need to have it 10/10!!
2chainZ;-;I'd buy it even if it was 60 dollars. The game is amazing and the endless hours of fun you can have is unreal. From the various game modes to just messing around with your friends in open sandbox lobbies there's nothing you can't do. Totally recommend it to anyone who is looking to have random fun and just join any game mode that you can find within Gmod.
Axios;-;So many fun game modes to play :) This game is brilliant with friends.
Hllahu Hackbar (Back 18th July);-;Really good if you are looking for a sandbox game, Major Addon support, easy to make addons for (if you are into that)
[FL:RP] Xx7soonyxP;-;its from the best games ever XD
[R]adio[A]ctive;-;the best gamer ever ;3
ciknapp;-;Imagine the best thing in the universe... and then forget it, because you're looking at it right here!
The_Real_Deal;-;What keeps me playing Gmod? It's the finest game where you can break any squeaker's dignity.
420 Shades of Blaze;-;I really like this game. Recommend it to everyone. Really expands your creativity, and there are lots of gamemodes in gmod. So it's basically like you have 20 games and not just one :D
Plague Doctor-=(AM.SN)=-;-;Simply awesome... Best sandbox game ever.U need 2 play this.Trust me
xXthatNAVYguyXx{PCG};-;This game is absolutely incredible! I was so fascinated by it that not only have I not been able to stop playing it, but I now run two Garry's Mod servers that are incorporated into a server network, and I am staff on many others.
Isreal-Senpai;-;Its a great and fun game
Snowdrop;-;A great game with a huge amount of potential. Due to there being lots of gamemodes out there, this is mainly focused on the DarkRP, TTT and Hide & Seek gamemodes. I find all three interesting and just plainly fun, in all i've probaly used half of my gametime on TTT, then a good third on DarkRP and the rest on H&S. You should realy check them out as they're awesome. DarkRP if you're into roleplaying and "acting", so per say. H&S stands clearly enough. TTT can be fun at times, but also a complete mind buster if you're new to it, even experience players find it hard to keep track of everything. In total i'd say this game is worth exactly it's price. Other than a few bugs that never gets fixed it's a safe bet on lots of fun hours.
w1nner;-;Sex Drugs Rock'n'roll
Darkspine483;-;This is Garry's Mod (hence the name). A game where everything's controlled by you, the player. There's countless ways to enjoy this game, be it just building things, shooting stuff, or just messing around. You are the one who decides the way the game is played. To play this game you must own one or any of the source games since it uses them to get the textures, models and whatnot. Theres's also the steam workshop (recently added for this game) which replaces the Toybox and it lets you easily download and install "addons" such as more models, weapons, maps, gamemodes, etc. So overall, if you like to mess around with friends, enjoy various game types, or just want to create things, then this game is well worth your time and you will most definitely like it.
Critical Crackhead;-;Endless possibilities in this game, never really gets boring unless your playing alone and being antisocial lmao. Fun to play with friends.
A.Suhaimi;-;Garry's Mod, it's a very good sandbox, Indie related game. Recommended for gamers, easy to cope.
echo;-;Great game if you don't want to try-hard or get deep into the gameplay. Very fun and best for playing with many freinds! :)))
Dr. Soiltim;-;Best physics.
Leon Sandcastle;-;If you do not have this game yet welcome to steam! You obviously haven't had it for long Best game 10/10
Zarbonito;-;After playing this game for a whole week, I can say... Get. This. . Game.

Beanie Kitty;-;buy it now or i will eat you
Ven;-;Was playing murder and told everyone to come around a big tree for a story, once I told it, I brutally killed all of them. 11.1/10
CheekyGeeky1;-;Very, very VERY fun. Lots of gamemodes, lots of possibility. Cons:Loading times are a pain, needs 1 or more Orange Box games.

Rogue Cheney [Away on Holiday];-;If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob a bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.
Hans;-;i wish i had more time to try this game out altered roleplay is the best community ever tho
Star_Hawk_;-;Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway. "Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm... _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more. _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore. _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds. _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want. _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10 Overall 8.5 Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

Valiantttt;-;Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.
Hoffa;-;You don't log 6000+ hours in a bad game if you get what I mean. http://youtube.com/Hoffa1337
FB||Gillan_Greenleaf;-;When I first bought this, my friend said "not a game, bro." He was right. It's not a game. It is your world. Do with it what you wish.
Asian-chan;-;You can spawn watermelons. 10/10
orane;-;An amazing game. Truly the first game with infinite free DLC. With millions of maps and plenty of gamemodes, Its a win.
Orange Box Nerd Senior;-;Never have I ever found such a random game, that has games within games. You can never get bored with it. From the popular Trouble in Terrorist Town to the classic sandbox mode, it has everthing you possibly think of(including Slenderman and DayZ). When I first heard the name Garry's Mod, i unintentionally said "What is that?" friends told me to go search up videos made using Gmod, and I instantly fell in love with it. If you are thinking of buying this game, don't hesitate. Buy it immediately. 5 out of 5
Dr.Gamer;-;This is the best game I've ever played in my gaming life! :D Prop Hunt is my absolute favorite thing to do on this game! I can't describe how much I love Garry's Mod! Just buy this game! IT'S A DEFINITE MUST HAVE! You'll have alot of endless amount of fun! :D 100000000/10 Melons :D
BIG BOSS;-;THIS GAME IS EPIC!!! I must say this game is a must buy if you are modder like me that loves modding games This is the game for you because the endless things you can do on this game is mind blowing! Mr Garry made Magic and that Magic is powerful :D
Pyndul;-;i usually just roleplay as a hobo and sling poop at peoples houses until they shoot me 10/10
Zekken;-;lol it has guns in it like call of dooty
~*~spaghetti and meatballs~*~;-;- A splendid and enjoyable game to play. - A large variety of impressive game modes to play in. - Fascinating game play and extremely pleasant building techniques. - Multiple add ons that are genius and majorly productive. - A broad community which makes the gameplay much more interesting; and entertaining. I suggest this game to majorly most gamers - this is a fantastic and entertaining game to play and is somehow addictive in a unique way - have fun.
pattycoombe;-;Really good game. Love it
Alex;-;Garry's Mod is a social experiment of what would happen if you give children infinite power and let them run the world and everything went horribly wrong. No seriously buy the game and head to a DARK RP server it's complete chaos filled with  jokes and tears. In all seriousness though parents if you wanna see how bad of a parent you are buy this game for you son/daughter and while they play it listen in to what they're doing odds are you'll get an accurate repersentation of what kind of person they are going to become. Get other parents involved too! compare who is the better parent and see who wins, because odds are if this sounds like a good idea you probably a  parent so why not turn it into a competion with the other  parents in your neighborhood.
Alex;-;Warning - This review is heavily LUA modding based Once you think you've done everything in the game - Played all the gamemodes and tried all the best mods then I definitely recommend learning to mod the game. Trust me. If you think you've done everything, this opens so many new doors. The ability to make whatever the hell you want. Then once you get good enough you get a great sense of achievement as well as basic knowledge within general programming. I recommend the game itself without the whole modding part anyway. I just personally think it expands the game vastly making it for myself more enjoyable. Even if you're not into programming, this will sure as hell get you into it once you learn the basics. If you're interested follow either/both of these links: Getting Started LUA Tutorials (better for newer programmers who are new to the concept of documentation and want to know all the basic things): Garry's Mod Maurits - LUA Tutorials [maurits.tv] More Advanced LUA Tutorials (contains all the pre-made functions and hooks within the game and how to apply them in a very basic fashion, but is good if you understand general programming and how to read documentation): Official Garry's Mod LUA Modding Tutorials [wiki.garrysmod.com] (May I just finally add, I'm not overly great at the whole modding concept, but I enjoy it and that's all that counts and the reason I'll continue to improve myself within it) Any questions about this - add me here on steam and I'll be happy to give you a hand if you're looking to get started. But as I said, I don't want to promise anything good from myself. But I'll look to help.
Spoonz4free;-;i really like it because you can build,fight,etc many other things i cant describe about this game are all good nothing bad.
oz;-;Gary's Mod is one of the most well-known games throughout the whole Steam community. This is due to it's limitless oppertunities. Garry's Mod provides players with numerous items and tools to use to create virtually anything the player wants. This is also supported by player made items and structures that are available for ingame use. This adds even more depth to the game with the singleplayer and multiplayer. The multiplayer has hundreds of different and unique game types ranging from parquor with a twist (Deathrun) to fighting pirates on the seven seas (Pirate Ship Wars). Although this game was made inlate 2006, Gary's Mod seems to have not aged but become wiser and more advanced. However, this does mean that the game has quite a few glitches but that doesn't matter as most of them make the game funnier and a better experience. Pros: - Hours upon hours of gameplay - Infinite options of what to create/do - Vast amount of game types and maps - Amazing community - Player-made content - Great value for money - Easy controls - Next to everything is customisable Cons: - A few minor glitches Overall, Garry's Mod has earnt it's place as one of the top Steam games of all time. This means that I will give Garry's Mod a very well earned 10/10.
The Psychotic Snivy;-;Garry's mod. Pretty fun. Just requires CS:S for like everything. And maybe Half-life 2. And all the episodes. But definitely all worth your money.
Dr. Happy;-;Best sandbox game out there!
Juan;-;This game was the only thing i played for 2 weeks straight. Best game ever.
Joelibear;-;You can't help but fall in love with this game when you think that everythings gotten stale someone makes a new gamemode or because of the free nature of this game something happens that just makes your day. I have wasted hundreds of hours of my life on this game and expect to waste alot more!
WhiteBoiNiggaz;-;good game you will like it trust me there are a lot of gamemodes like darkrp it is like real life in game it is a really fun game if you get it go to my profile and say you like it or not and tell me why
[FL:DJ] [F.I] Doctor Internet;-;As someone who has played over 3000 hours of GMod, and having bought it back in the GMod 12 version, I can talk about both versions. Prior the game did have some game-breaking bugs, sometimes suffered from other issues, such as frame-rate or stack overflow. However, the update to GMod 13 did fix most of these, however I do at times suffer from random crashing. Despite this I tend to enjoy it as a sandbox game, with the ability to smack around ragdolls for hours at a time does provide some release from the world. As much as I would like to say that the update to GMod 13 fixed all the problems, it didn't. However, it did do a good job at fixing most of them, thus I would recommend this game, just if not for future premis.
Kyuuru;-;Fun and entertaining. Easy to troll and grief if you're bored. It's worth to get.
Lord Franko;-;Every time I play gmod and get off. I have the urge to prop kill in real life. Gmod unleashes the troll in you! In other words you should buy it!
Serpa;-;This is a must have game. Get it.
Harry;-;If you liked goofy gamemods and messing around whilst having fun, this is definately for you!
Thug Aim;-;Open. That is about the only way to really describe this game. Open. It STILL has a big community, many different modes, and a very open mentality throughout it's players. 10/10 Buy this, especially on sale!
TrustTheTurtle;-;I Love Garry's Mod
Alexjd2020;-;i didnt think i would like it at first but with workshop support and with the memorys it produces it is a good game 10/10
Krazymace;-;I made a giant dild0 and propkill people with it. Got banned from the server. 10/10 would make makeshift pleasure toys for a living.
[RFAI] Sparta;-;BUY THIS GAME! I have a couple hundred hours at this point some of my friends have over a thousand. I have made many friends because of this game!
Ryn;-;good game you must try it,if u dont have it get it now,this game is a sandbox game and you must be creative to play this game if you not creative its hard to build something
Imamadhatt3r;-;Fun game to play with friends in prop hunt or murder :D

Unfinished;-;I drove a bathtub. 10/10
Nope.avi;-;This game i gotta say the best sandbox game there ever is! This sandbox game allows you to make any creation or any form of art like posing ragdolls and taking a screen shots of them! This game is very creative i highly recommend this game if you want to create.
Shoween;-;A good game for creative people, with lot's of variety in gamemodes... For the less creative people...
RIP MY NEWTON'S CRADLE;-;When I first bought the game, I didn't realize how good it was and left it to be just another un-used game on my library. I'm starting to play it a lot. You don't belong on Steam if you don't have this game.
Blaze;-;Just... play.
broken.....;-;well to start off it's a funny game with lot's of creativity but i dont find the online experience as good as say battlefield, Left 4 dead, and minecraft. I think the game is meant more for people who want to make small video games and movies. I do like however how they add TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) to the game allready so you dont have to download it :) But whoever thought of the idea to make this game i want to give them one big brofist :D
Nomadic Dog Lint;-;I laughed too much about shooting a watermelon 57.89/57.9
Derpina (   );-;Love this game. One of my favourites of all time because of the various things you can do. This is a must buy for and Steam user!
DJ PON3;-;Really Fun game you can find friends play different servers like deathrun and stuff cool addons :D
FPW-SIRNINJACAT;-;buy this game if you want to waste the rest of your life.TRUST ME.

The True Nig Nig;-;Its really fun- Definitely a game you want to get if your bored often- Tons of gamemodes to download and play free! ^^
dudegoys;-;Although it is a fun sandbox, It takes so long just to load a server. But I give the game about 8.5/10 So yep, Great game.
Kirby653;-;This game gives you many options of what to do when you are bored. Totes coolio. Play it. YOU WILL NEVER GET OUT!!!!
LordNature -DontDisturb;-;Garry's Mod has many possibilities as it is an engine not a game. Your imagination is your limit. Go wild, learn Lua, make madmen, and try something new... GMod, the world's the limit.
Blueberry!;-;Ever wanted Alyx to fu-ck a manhack? Ever wanted to create a giant death pony with a giant dong? Ever wanted to read 27,000 LUA errors? Ever wanted to stare at a loading screen for 3 hours? Ever wanted to Look at Purple and Black checkers? THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU

KillerRogueKiwiPie;-;This game is a must for creative builders! the possibilities are endless, though it takes quite some time to get adjusted to the tools, mods and commands. It is more of a Co-op game than single player though you can play offline on singleplayer. The Co-op experience is great you make friends, face trolls, enjoy the game mods and have fun!

Viikatemies;-;I started to play Garry's mod thinking I would have fun with creative new game types. I was wrong. If you love children and people with Autism well then this is the community for you! Every server and I mean every server! Gets so  off and talks like their mom smoked crack while she was carrying them in her stomach for the 9 months of pregnacy OR you get kids that were literally just born 6 weeks ago. If you are going to get this and play it make sure you get 20 of your friends to remind kids to go back to playing Call of Duty and Skylanders. Oh and the ones with Autism can I guess just kill themselves. They have seen to much thanks to them having access to the internet.
Crusty Butt Nugget;-;Spawn a chair, sit on a chair. 11/10

MeowBoss;-;All in one. 10/10
nox062;-;Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name.
Baby Beard;-;This Game Most Popular Game In Steam Every1 Has To Own It Ask Me.... Best Game When ever your bored or just want to enjoy some gameplay Diffrent Game Modes Popular Trouble Terrorist Town Prop Hunt Sandbox Etc.
Meowsor;-;Probably the most fun i have ever had on a game. You never run out of things to do with all the mods. Also as a server owner I can say that you can do anything with this game. Much Fun. Meow.
{PS}LaBantaPanda;-;This game is basicly 50 different games in one. a few of the games i will go over. sandbox(well no need to explain that) Darkrp(roleplay in a city earning money) Prophunt(no need to explain) Zombie survival(barracade in yourself or attack survivors) deathrun(try to make it too the end) Yup
Author.;-;This game is a wonderfull game, and I really enjoy it!
IGotAShotgun;-;Garry's Mod is less of a game and more of an interactible physics engine with extensible scripting. Because of this, the vanilla game is only as fun as your imagination can carry you. Build a house. Build a car. Throw dynamite everywhere. Put ragdolls into sexual positions. Once you've matured enough to stop putting ragdolls in sexual positions, you'll find the amazing number of custom gamemodes available, coded by the players, for the players. First, there's Trouble in Terrorist Town. In this gamemode some of the players are assigned as "Traitors", and have to kill everyone. It's a great game, especially with cooperative players, but some random kid can get bored of his ragdolls, come one and randomly start shooting everyone (This is called RDM, or Random Deathmatch). Your enjoyment of TTT is largely dependant on the server Then there's RP. There are MANY versions of RolePlay available, but they all have the same idea. You live in a town. There are law enforcers, robbers and more, and that's really it. It's a bit like Second Life in a way, but with guns and RDM. If you can get into a good community it can be extremely fun, although that depends on your preference. If you just want to build stuff, you can join a build server. Here, people build things, just like in vanilla singleplayer. Let your imagination run wild, ask for help with some things, and make something cool. These servers are unfortunately juicy targets for RDM McSexyragdoll and his pals, so watch out. You've already noticed this, but the only thing that lets Gmod down is it's communtiy. It's attracted a horde of underage. immature squeakers who just want to troll and be "le funni". Good servers keep them away, but bad ones don't. Another thing you might want to stay away from is the Workshop. All the good things are drowned in a sea of sexual ragdolls, "epic cars" and other useless crap. The only good thing the Gmod workshop has going for it is the lack of "ADD THIS VALVE BECAUSE ITS EPIC" and "THIS IS BOB COPY PASTE HIM EVERYWHERE SO HE CAN TAKE DOWN GOOGLE +" Another thing to keep in mind is that you'll need Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike : Source to get the best experience. Many custom gamemodes use CSS stuff, and they won't work without it. Also TF2 might be required in some servers All in all Gmod is a great game that's plagued with "trolls". Get some friends together and have fun, or find a good server. Just watch out for the kiddies trying to be cool and you'll have a nice time tl;dr : GET THIS AND CSS AND PLAY TTT WITH YOUR FRIENDS
David Tennant's own Converse;-;Probably the most fun you will have in a video game, it's hilarious its creative, there is content from other games, such as VALVe, if you are looking for entertainment beyond your wildest dreams,  call of duty, this is where its at
2Kawaii4u;-;it is a realy fun game that is a sandbo and more like prop hunt and zombie survial and there are mods that you can add on to make the game more fun and you can play with freinds.
Furthermore;-;A extremely fun sandbox, you can pretty much let your mind go wild here
Secret_Oscar_The_Grouch (girl);-;this game is amazing for making great frends, and meeting amazing new people. i would rate this AWESOME!
MR.Chips;-;Do i recommend this game? MY ANSWER IS YES!
Agent Enrique;-;Really fun game. Endless choices of fun and creativity.
Melo #vacation;-;More Lua errors than Roblox could dream of
Frodo Swaggins;-;welp, 1,122 hours played... now I can properly review this. Looking at the date this has been redone by 19/01/2014 and not 5th august 2011. Now that I have got that out the way, this is garrys mod the great sandbox game? I'm sorry but this is NOT a sandbox game. This is a special game in the way of HEY HEY DUDE LETS GO JAM A MILLION ADDONS ONTO THIS GAME AND MAKE IT CRASH WHEN WE SPAWN IN SOMETHING!!!11 That is sadly what I do now, but this game is great seriously. Look at the pictures jesus it already looks good... and then you buy it. lets hope that you own EVERY SOURCE GAME EVER well, any by valve or a mod thats gone mainstream (zombie panic etc.) because trut me. all the mapmakers love their assets not included within the files. I can't go into the mechainics either because this game is what you want it to be! Well to be honest their are a few things. PHYSGUN: the thing you use for moving 'props' and 'ragdolls' and it wouldn't be garrys mod without the thing. TOOLGUN: you get to do stuff... you've possibly seen it in the screen shots with the derpy faces. ENTIRE HL2 ARSENAL: umm... do I need to even speak about the stuff? also if you haven't played HL2 yet then uh, don't kill yourself and buy it. And now for uh... Lingo Buster 9001!!! SANDBOX: its a sandbox, do whatever you want in it, crap in it for all I care. (ITS ALSO THE DEFAULT GAMEMODE FOR THE POSING N STUFF) ADDON: a fancy way of saying mod but it isn't exactly a mod. For example a addons adds something new but dosent change a few lines of code. MODELS: you'd know what models are if you looks at the banner, screensshots etc. and this also segways into! RAGDOLLS AND PROPS: ragdolls are basically things that move when you move them around and you also pose them to do uh... things that are innocent and the complete opisi-UGHRRR GROSS while props on the otehr hand are things you can't pose but can move around and stick to each other and do some pre-tty cool stuff with. SCARY G-MAN VIRUS: RUN, RUN SO FAST, TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER NEVER GO ONTO A SERVER THAT SAYS... Gmod tower server 2 on sandbox on the map flatgrass?! or atleast anything with a  name. For example DUUUUHH I LIKE BUHTS and FURRIES FTW. This game gets a ?.?/10 because this game is anything you want it to be like i said a million times and you can cause the game to crash. It's all up to you in mod-gameish of the year 2004-93819823612783512734512412572648 (no but seriously how many version of garrys mod are there!?!?)
holy macaroni;-;This game is really awesome,and funny. It's really worth your money :3
The Barney Effect;-;Barney Approves of this game (   )
DJ EGGWHITES;-;This game is the reason I am here today. God bless you Garry Newman.
cyphoon;-;Eat it.
SNiPEzz;-;This is a really good game if your into "sandbox". Sandbox is just where you can do pretty much you want. This game is kind of like and EPIC version of minecraft.
ClintBeastWood;-;Get this you will not regret it.
Cheezeeman;-;I LOVE GARRY'S MOD. There is so much to do in it. Whether you are building some contraption or playing a gamemode with your friend (or a mix of both, in some situations), it is probably one of the best games I have ever played. You can lay round with what you start with when you first install the game, trying to build something with the tools you're given, or you can go the Workshop and download a ton of props, SWEPS, Gamemodes, Tools, Scars, and more. The controls are simple and easy to learn and the stuff you can do when you overcome the basics is amazing. Although you may come across some missing textures or errors, you can buy CS:GO (Which is only like $10 or something) to fix it. I love Gmod in all its glory and splendor. 10/10 Would play again for the rest of eternity.
Citizen;-;Garry's Mod is basically loads of games in one game; from build servers to death match servers and everything inbetween.
Hllahu Hackbar (Back 17th July);-;Really good if you are looking for a sandbox game, Major Addon support, easy to make addons for (if you are into that)
[FL:RP] Xx7soonyxP;-;its from the best games ever XD
[R]adio[A]ctive;-;the best gamer ever ;3
ciknapp;-;Imagine the best thing in the universe... and then forget it, because you're looking at it right here!
The_Real_Deal;-;What keeps me playing Gmod? It's the finest game where you can break any squeaker's dignity.
420 Shades of Blaze;-;I really like this game. Recommend it to everyone. Really expands your creativity, and there are lots of gamemodes in gmod. So it's basically like you have 20 games and not just one :D
Plague Doctor-=(AM.SN)=-;-;Simply awesome... Best sandbox game ever.U need 2 play this.Trust me
xXthatNAVYguyXx{PCG};-;This game is absolutely incredible! I was so fascinated by it that not only have I not been able to stop playing it, but I now run two Garry's Mod servers that are incorporated into a server network, and I am staff on many others.
{({TG})} Mudkip King;-;Garry's Mod is Minecraft on steroids. The users can build literally anything and put it into this game, shall they have the skill. You can download things from the steam workshop in seconds, and the things you can download are either clever and creative, funny and weird, random and silly, or stupid and pointless. The tools are hilarious from face poser to inflator. The gamemodes, such as TTT and DarkRP (I could have a review for each and every one on their own and probably take more than one read more) are so great that I would pay more than I would have to play for all the valve games for each one in it's own game. It comes with great amounts of ragdolls, props, NPC's and more. The "example", as I call them, face and finger poses are great. The only thing I can think of that would be wrong with the game is the frame rate on crappy computers such as my own. 10/10.
Blame the Ahri;-;I love this game, have over 400 hours on it. Highly recommended.
Ripster7;-;Garry's Mod, or more comonly refured to as 'Gmod', is a game that is solely for the imagination, it uses the Source engine and thanks to this we can enjoy many games inside the world of Gmod. If you enjoy having 'brain children' this is your kind of game, with its open sandbox modes on many free map packs that you can download or even create using the Steam Woorkshop. The maps box is the limits.... well some times.
ogrebeastshrek;-;This is by far one of the best sandbox games I have ever played. Although it crashes occasionaly and the multiplayer takes forever to load. But other than that, great game. Keep up the good work facepunch.
Wiked7778;-;Amazing gmae, do whatever you want
Vicinity;-;Great game. I really suggest you get it, because of the ammount of things you can do in it. Whatever you think of,there is most likely an addon for it on the workshop. It is the freedom and unlimited nature of the game that I love. I am sure you will love it too.
n0ga_p0ga;-;This game is amazing. Its fun for just making screenshots, Sandbox, or laying the variety of gamemodes. I haven't known one person in this game without atleast having 5 mods. The mods are a huge part in this. There are mods for about anything you can think of, more gamemodes, more items, exclusive DLC, and many many more. I am hopefully going to put some more hard worked hours and money into this. These games : Counter Strike : Source, Half-Life 2, DoD Source (Day of Defeat), any of these games are needed. For better experience, buy all of those games. It adds more gamemodes, and more items to mess with. GMod Tower is my favorite out of all the gamemodes. Simply, if you are in a down mood, or simply just in a SILLY MOOD. This game has so many things to experience. This game, it takes skill to master. Put a good 200+ hours or so into it, and you will know your way around things. DO NOT buy this game for the full $10. This game goes on sale alot and for a long time. $2.50 is the normal price to see it, or 1 key in any game that has anything to do with Trading, or keys, or uncrating for items. Even if someone has a copy of this game, they are usually selling it for a key, because of it being on sale so much. The highest you will see this game is 4 keys inTF2, or more. If someone sells at this price, tell them to lower it. It would just be something good. If you plan taking my suggestions or anyone elses, get ready to put countless hours and your hard earned money to donating to your favorite servers to keep them running. Sandbox, its uses are endless. I give this game a 10/10, with "Pineapple Seal Of Approval" depending on how you see it.
Papa Franku;-;Total randomness get it now, seriously as in NOW
Caleb;-;>10/10 would recommend.
Snowdrop;-;A great game with a huge amount of potential. Due to there being lots of gamemodes out there, this is mainly focused on the DarkRP, TTT and Hide & Seek gamemodes. I find all three interesting and just plainly fun, in all i've probaly used half of my gametime on TTT, then a good third on DarkRP and the rest on H&S. You should realy check them out as they're awesome. DarkRP if you're into roleplaying and "acting", so per say. H&S stands clearly enough. TTT can be fun at times, but also a complete mind buster if you're new to it, even experience players find it hard to keep track of everything. In total i'd say this game is worth exactly it's price. Other than a few bugs that never gets fixed it's a safe bet on lots of fun hours.
Darkspine483;-;This is Garry's Mod (hence the name). A game where everything's controlled by you, the player. There's countless ways to enjoy this game, be it just building things, shooting stuff, or just messing around. You are the one who decides the way the game is played. To play this game you must own one or any of the source games since it uses them to get the textures, models and whatnot. Theres's also the steam workshop (recently added for this game) which replaces the Toybox and it lets you easily download and install "addons" such as more models, weapons, maps, gamemodes, etc. So overall, if you like to mess around with friends, enjoy various game types, or just want to create things, then this game is well worth your time and you will most definitely like it.
Critical Crackhead;-;Endless possibilities in this game, never really gets boring unless your playing alone and being antisocial lmao. Fun to play with friends.
A.Suhaimi;-;Garry's Mod, it's a very good sandbox, Indie related game. Recommended for gamers, easy to cope.
echo;-;Great game if you don't want to try-hard or get deep into the gameplay. Very fun and best for playing with many freinds! :)))
Dr. Soiltim;-;Best physics.
Leon Sandcastle;-;If you do not have this game yet welcome to steam! You obviously haven't had it for long Best game 10/10
Zarbonito;-;After playing this game for a whole week, I can say... Get. This. . Game.
Schorcher;-;Can't go wrong with this game. Endless fun that will keep you coming back even when you think you're done with it.
A4 | JordanTheGuy #Ilovethequeen;-;Too much to say about this game, so little space.
midefender99;-;This is fun.
dragon born;-;its a really good game I most play online that's really all you can do but there is single player but it's sand box game the sand box games are really better online but other people might think different about the single player. I think if you like to kill people and them over with your cars then get the game. But get the Garry,s mod and counter Strike bundle.
HeLLFUry_428;-;This game is one of those games you can do whatever the hell you want for soooo long 10/10
back next saturday;-;This game is great and i by all means recommend it. Although the rp is full of spiteful children im sure you'll get a good laugh out of it ;)
BlueWolf;-;Yes mmmmhmm vveeerrrrry nice game....yesssssssss...mmmmmmhmmmmmm
Adi Biti;-;very cool and creative game, 8.5/10
EpicGuthix;-;IT'S SO AMAZING!!!!!
Tobio Kageyama[]R;-;Garry's Mod is a great way to meet awesome gamers and nice people. When you play consistently with someone you end up being in these little server communities and it's great. Certain tastes for certain players, but it's all the same. I'm thankful for the people I met because of this game and it brings me a lot of joy to see people with the same love of the game that they have for other gamers.
kokoro;-;I have to say that this game is amazing for people who enjoy building what they want like Machines, Buildings etc.
Baltharn;-;Who is Garry and why are we playing his mod? That question won't be answered in this review instead I'm trying to take the  out of it by saying that this game features a terrible community which is totally the game's fault. You can create your own scenarios using this but no one cares anyway because people instead play the mods in Garry's Mod. There are a lot of mods in Garry's Mod however only a handful get played. You have roleplay servers where you don't roleplay but kill as many people as possible until an Admin bans you, try to beat your personal best! We also have TTT which is deathmatch with a cop and robbers theme, very original. This game attracts wonderful people that do not sniff used pampers. 68/100
SCORP;-;Garry's mod is the best sandbox game ever created. You can do whatever you want with the insane amount of mods for it. Think of it as the game that has a bit of every game incorporated into it. Wether you want a shooter, puzzle, rpg, etc. Garry's mod has it. This game is a must have in everybodies steam library.
Viking Batman;-;Awsome game your gonna love it :S
wT.;-;A good game to practice a 420NoScopeHeadshotMLGpRo and other stuff.
Zoneglobal;-;Great Game! It is like a bunch of games inside one game!
Shamoo The Ass-Whale;-;This game is amazing and so much fun! I love the physics and the mutiplayer tools and other things! This game is so awesome!
Buster_;-;A perfect game for creative people! Allowing people to build whatever they feel like building! A House? Giant Robot? Nuke? The Workshop also gives a wide range of addons to boost your experience!
kktrollmankk;-;Garry's Mod is a really fun Sandbox game with many diffrent kind of Game modes, This game is really worth it and fun to play with friends.
Mellow;-;best game u can buy, u get a 1000 games in one!!!
Toffe261;-;Completed it m8. 10/10
Lemonload;-;This is the best game I have ever played, possibly the best game in the world. You can do absolultely everything you have ever dreamed of! Garry's Mod can sometimes help you with other games, something not many other games can do. Steam Workshop has many wonderful addons to enhance Garry's Mod, making it simply amazing. Busy multiplayer servers, great singleplayer, it's a must have for anyone, whether you wish to play seriously, or just have some fun messing around. I cannot recommend it enough, it's absolutely fantastic, simple to learn, impossible to master. 10/10
That Newb;-;This Game has so many gamemodes and so many chances for funny things to happen, This game is entertaining and you should get it...
I mean I guess;-;JUST BUY IT GOD DONT ASK ANYTHING JUST BUY IT ITS SO FUN
CoolPantsMcBiscuitMittens;-;One of the best sandbox games ever! My only critiqe is that this game could give more info to new players.
Irrelevant;-;Garry's Mod is a game for 2 types of people. The first type, is people who like creating things. You can create nearly anything in the source engine, with the right addons, and if you aren't very good, there are youtube videos on it all. I got into this game after the main yogscast channel showed off the addon pack for making space ships. I spent hours in this, and using the base creation tools, before I found out how awesome the multiplayer gamemodes are. I am not sure how many are made by Facepunch studios, but it is through their work that so many are able to easily experience projects made by single people, or budding indie devs of the future. The other types of people are those who spend all of their time on Trouble in Terrorist Town, or Murder, or Prophunt, or any of the main game modes. Heck, you and your friends can walk into a virtual cinema and watch all of SeaNanners's and the yogscast's videos to learn about them! This game has everything apart from what you can imagine. All you have to do is make it.
Otaku Oliver;-;Gaben is love, Gaben is life As a child i always lived PC games, i used to beg my Dad to buy me games, i would pray to LORD GABEN at night, hoping that he would grant me sales. Gaben would always give me sales usually 75% off. I had all the Valve games and would constantly trade and open cases. Keys were expensive. My Father could hear me praying to gaben, he came in and smashed my computer against the wall, i was crying over the smashed up parts crunched up on the floor. I started on cry over the loss of my Gaming pc. I knew my Dad was jealous for my devoting to Gaben. I start to fall asleep. I feel a strange presence enter my room. I quickly woke up to find Gaben. standing next to my Bed. "its gaben" i loudly though to myself". I am so happy to see him. Gaben then uses his powers to lift up my broken pc and repair it with his mind. I am so thankful that he did such a kind thing. Gaben then proceeds to walk up to me. He then whispers in my ear," this is my hat", i threw my Ghastly gibus at him, he rejects it and bends me over the bed, he enters my his fat fingers into my pants. but went for my pocket instead and takes out my wallet, he uses his magic to grant me 95% sales on all the games on my wishlist. Then penetrates my wallet and takes $10 out it is expensive but i do it for gaben. it is uncomfortable. He then proceeds to take out a $50 note, in the irritation i scream out "Fluttershy is best pony, not pinkie". Gaben is furious now and throws me against the wall, which reveals a secret wall safe. He walks over to the safe and takes out all my money, then begins to penetrate my tight butt hole, it hurts but i do it for Gaben. The noise attracts my dad to the room. My dad enters the room and finds me bent over in the corner in tears of joy and pain, while he sees gaben thrusting my hard. Gaben turns to my dad and looks him dead in the eye and flies out the window and says his last words 'Gaben is love, Gaben is life', followed by, "you will never resist my sales". i am now nearly unconscious in satisfaction as drool flows out of my mouth and i am still curled up in a bent over position.
Twilight Sparkle;-;Gmod Is a Fun game where to Make Friends and Have Fun Most People Don't Care about your Age i Don't But I say This Should be one of your First games to buy to Learn the Basics :D
xLimits_;-;Just an awesome game made from an source engine!You could do whatever you want there and build your stuff.So if you love building I will recommend you to this game!
FNCE  Stoneybruh;-;great game
J7 Gaming;-;Well everyone knows and loves this game, but for those ( Few ) who don't here are some things about the game. It have single and multi player modes. it has gamemode like RP ( RolePlaying ), DarkRP, TTT ( touble in town ), SandBox ( Main Gamemode ), Jailbreak and may more. In single player there are a lot of thinsg to do ( Without Mods ). First you can make a house out of dushbins and sinks. Second you can put ragdolls in as people, but if you want you can put a NPC in or AI player which will follow you. But if you are looking for a War then you can add Combine NPC which will try to kill you and normal NPC's. Now to some mods. Have you every wanted to fly tons of planes the WAC is for you its is the best Mods making for planes. Now How bout some good guns, well the i recommed all gun mods because there awsome. Now for a ride look for Scars Slim, Basic, Extra for great cars, also Garry Mods on Wheels and TDM Car. But i give this game a loved... 10/10 - LOVE IT OR DIE
[green][FNG] [red]Ninjaschild;-;This is the best game I have ever owned on PC.
Colonel "Killzone" Kreiger;-;This game is a crossover of all valve game, I LOVE IT
You!You!You!;-;This is one of the most creative/fun games that exsits
DyonisX;-;Pretty much a must have game...
Japple;-;One of the very few games that provides endless, and with that I really mean, ENDLESS, fun. It just simply can't get boring. The Workshop is full of oppertunities to keep the game fresh and due to its many gamemodes you have a wide range of playstyles for Garry's Mod. Absolutely a must-have for the average PC gamer.
DeadSloth;-;Got brains? Got friends with brains? Good! You'll have fun. Got neither? You'll still have fun.
Seor Koquonfaes;-;You can spawn ing bananas dude... ING BANANAS HOW MUCH EMPHASIS DO I NEED TO MAKE ON THAT!? IT CAN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT, TRUST ME.
Jaagren;-;Favorite game ever a must buy
Scramjat;-;Great GUI, works well, lots of players. More than just a level editor, also a physics (game physics of course) editor.
Normen;-;this game is best game
Kello1-0-6;-;Garry's-Mod is a game with so mods such as: Jailbreak, Dark-RP and TTT. Those kind of games are filled of all kinds of game idias, here is an example. Dark-RP - About going into a city, finding a job, make a gang, sell drugs, arrest people, install camreas, sell cars and more.. As you can see this game is a really inpressive game. If you want to enjoy more then 20 well made gamemodes / game subjects. If you think that you ran out of mods your wrong. there are just so much mods. My rate: 8.5/10 Remmber: Every year they are still updating this game is growing with updates and other mods.
mlangsam22;-;Garry's Mod is easily the best steamgame i have ever played let alone sandbox game. While it is quite amazing it is very hard to explain. It Garry's Mod you can literally do whatever you would like. Any gamemode is made. Here are a few, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, RP, Tower and I am sure you have heard of a few. Please get this game it is worth the 10 measily dollars. I promise + i will pplay with you WHENEVER YOU WANT, (Literally) :)
Knightwing;-;Never Trust the K
Jiggly Whale Cock;-;This game kicks
HivPanda Rapist;-;You can do pretty much anything
Zalgo is the new Taz {salty};-;played with horses for 5 hours than played some prop hunt over all this game is a 10 out of 10
Scooby Doo;-;Amazing game with so many gamemodes and possibilities. Whatever it to your liking, Garry's Mod can do it all.
MehFiz;-;Best game you can watch Cinema and play with your friend :D
DannyS;-;This game is a very great game and i love it. The best gamemode has to be, well all of them i love all of the gamemodes. This game has taken 515 hours of my life and i have loved every hour of it. If you have not this game i think you should get this game.
BOT Butt Butt;-;Love it
Fred The Communist Jihadist;-;Spooderman apruves of des gam es so cuul
God;-;Buy it best game ever. Let your imagination loose! Blow up some damn headcrabs!  on peoples while being a hobo in RolePlay!  some peoples while being Slenderman! Run LIKE A BOSS! Raid some peoples like never before! ps Buy Counter-Strike - Source with Gmod for better experience.
SL4DE;-;It's garry's mod. Whatever you want to do, you build it, script it, and create it. But, if you don't want to get too deep into it, there is more than enough tools to have fun with.
minz1;-;If you don't buy this I will smack yo face off.
SnoopyDog;-;Fun and Great game!
Leviateinn;-;It's alright i guess
Cory Baxter;-;This games makes me feel an immense amount of hate towards turtles...
smhity123;-;This game is great but too many people rdm and it really upsets me so I go to the admin and say "HE RDM MEEEE!" until they ban him
BlaBlaTalker;-;LOVE THIS GAMEE !!! You know, this game is like sandbox simulator of any game you like. The prettyness of this game is its workshop. You can find whatever you want and then make it as you just wish. You can play so many different gamemods and *simulate* other games here - Rust, DayZ, CS, TF2, Half-Life, and many many others. Or just hang out with your friends in sandbox mod shooting each other or just doing some weird stuff. ( WTF I made porno movie with Alyx Vance) So this game is 100% worth buying...!!!
Allerianna;-;Pretty random and wierd game,I find myself struggling to know what the hell i am doing in many of the game modes. Basically,it's one of those "We give the players everything,and let society begin in here" kind of games. YET,THAT'S THE ONLY COMPLAINT I'VE GOT ABOUT THIS GAME. The community. For some reason,i always,always run into s in any of the game modes,rude people,elitist idiots,whining es,desperate guys,zealot bronies, furs,it seems like all of the scum on steam got together in this game. Don't get me wrong,there is lots of good,polite players in here,but the rest.....Ugh... I always said "If you got more than a thousand hours in Garry's mod,you are probably mentally disturbed,or suffering some kind of problem with your life" And for  sake,i have yet to prove that wrong. Community aside,this game is pretty awesome to give a casual play now and then,or for those long gaming nights where you just hang around servers expecting something to happen,or just having a blast with some of the players that are still up at that time.
sharkle;-;Such a varied experience across servers and myriad gamemodes, Garry's Mod is literally the most you can get out of a game, period. Spend the money (but make sure you have CS:S), you'll not regret it.
Salty_Skittlez;-;Garry's Mod.... Where do I start? This game has so many things to do, its amazing and you will never get bored playing it. If you are the Steam Workshop has many fun things to play and toy around with. From physics to cars to guns and to creativity this game has no limits and is a great investment. 10/10 EASILY
Jacky38;-;worst gaem evr, even tho i hev 120+ screenshots/artwork of it. Got  SWEP. GMOD froze 11/10 - It is like Call of Dog : Goust , IGN
Atoroth;-;Its amazing endless fun!!!!!!!!
Tezza;-;Play this and your life is complete. 8============D
fancy #nomonitor;-;So, Yes, Garry's Mod, I know. It is already publically known nearly worldwide. It's a good game, Think it's for most people. That's all. Have a nice life.
Porter;-;To be honest one of the funniest games on steam, it's funny ,great game and such a good deal, The game does not have any objectives really. The game consists of making maps and objects at your disposal, this game gives you the props from source games to then make you own wacky inventions and so on. The game is full of servers that you can play, for example there is a cinema server where you can watch YouTube videos on the big screen with 30 other people! another is Death Race, this is a game mode is where you must reach the end without dying, pretty self explanatory really. If you have done your research you can probably tell that allot of videos are made using Garry's mode, well you right, allot of funny videos have been uploaded and made using the Garry's mod record system that makes it easy to understand. recommend 10/10
senpai;-;its so good that i pooped my pants
Predator CZ;-;"Lonely game" -> that's what I think about this "game" -> Is it really game? Of course not, its a multipurpose game, where you can do everything, build, drive vehicles, play multiplayer with other players (TTT,CW,DarkRP, Sandbox, Prophunt, ...), theres really lot of servers where you can see lot of fun. Also you can make and share your stuff via Workshop (R.I.P. Toybox), same as download them and enjoy them, like new Non-Player Characters, Weapons, Vehicles, and other stuff here. This game is not fun with Singleplayer, you can spent here over 1 hour and then you get bored, but if you have friends who can play with you its really fun. Also this game is development tool, whinch you create custom entities,wepons, vehicles and lot of stuff, where you using LUA(Jit) scripting language, to play with game engine. You can make here machinima as well. (After SFM release, rip GMOD) There's a lots of tool and stuff here, thats, why I calling this game multipurpose.
Nami;-;Gmod, is a Terrible Game. You end up wasting hours of ends, sitting on your chair on this game. In this game you can basically do whatever you want with endless addons. I would very much so recomend this game. You'll no doubt have a blast.
Broconut;-;Easily the best sandbox game I've EVER played... There are so many game-modes and extensions that you can get and play around with!!! Whether it's PvP, sandbox, mystery, roleplay, or anything you could think of, this game has it. The first game on steam I've ever played, and always going to be one of the best. Get it, especially since it's only $10!!
Keppy;-;Only seven words. The most beautiful mod i've ever seen.
ArrowFlint22;-;AWESOME!!! Best Hl2 mod ever! Minecraft is boring now because it does not have a lot of physics to it, but Gmod has more physics and lets you play around with stuff more. The thing I like most about it is the mechanics and creativity in it. The player gets lost in a world of creativity and imagination! Good job Valve!
Reesey Pie | Gaben Give Me W;-;Let me just start by saying gaben port this to the souce two engine. But anyways i really think this game is worth all the money only $10 this game will be worth your $10 it has endless amount of fun with millions of workshop items and game modes. So you never stop having fun!!
Danny;-;A Sandbox game created by Gary Newman with Valves Source Engine. It's one of the first games to recieve Sandbox support and one of the most played games on Steam. In Garry's Mod you have plenty of things to tinker with, for instance you can change the color of the skybox or sun, or you can spawn props to create your dream house, car, plane, boat, and if sandbox bores you? Well try out another gamemode made by other people, DarkRP and Flood are two great alternatives to sandbox. If you wanna truly test your imagination this game is a must have. rate 10/10
Taxtro;-;Oh Sheet
Ironicorn;-;Think of minecraft, then shoot it in the head and stuff the dead body with valve crap. This is what you get.
Spudato;-;this game is awesome it's just complicated but awesome still it takes a while to get good at but is worth it.
SauceyTim;-;I love this game, It's giving me countless hours of entertainment! And by countless I mean 400 hours or so.
SCORP;-;Garry's mod is the best sandbox game ever created. You can do whatever you want with the insane amount of mods for it. Think of it as the game that has a bit of every game incorporated into it. Wether you want a shooter, puzzle, rpg, etc. Garry's mod has it. This game is a must have in everybodies steam library.

tfw no more carthage;-;i feel sorry for you if you don't have this game
Plamet the Hedgehog;-;10/10. My wife and child have not received child support payments from me in months, and the dog has died. In an act of love for Sandbox games I have recently burned my PhD and danced in the ashes while saying a prayer in Latin to the developers. Currently their are 8 missing person reports out for me, and I have been evicted from my house, but it no longer matters to me so long as I get my fix. Recently I have had to sell my body for food. Before I did this, I of course ate the dog, because I have dignity. I would recommend this game to everyone.
Wapachoo;-;A great game overall. There's literrally nothing you cannot do.. Except fix the errors and missing textures (legally) without spending 20$ for CS:S. I made the mistake of not buying it with the game, thinking it wouldn't matter if there were a few missing textures... I was so wrong. TTT maps are mostly missing textures, any map with cs_ before it is full of errors and missing textures. But if you get CS:S with it, it looks great, and sandbox almost always is fun. Overall, I recommend it if you can pay the 30$ for both games. Oh, and 95/100.
| Snow;-;So many unique servers and gamemodes you never run out of things to do!
nox062;-;Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name.
Baby Beard;-;This Game Most Popular Game In Steam Every1 Has To Own It Ask Me.... Best Game When ever your bored or just want to enjoy some gameplay Diffrent Game Modes Popular Trouble Terrorist Town Prop Hunt Sandbox Etc.
Meowsor;-;Probably the most fun i have ever had on a game. You never run out of things to do with all the mods. Also as a server owner I can say that you can do anything with this game. Much Fun. Meow.
Space Kat;-;This game is areally fun sandbox game,no flaws that i have found while the game might be fun there are also hackers out there, but that doesnt matter there are also many game modes such as ttt,Murder,sandbox,zombie survival,gmod tower,gmod stranded. and so much more i reccomend cheking the game out. i think it is worth the price for what you get in the game there are also so many tools and weapons and adddons entities dupes and saves but what makes the game so fun is the mods in it.its also a great multiplayer co-op game, also some games you may need to run most of the textures Counter Strike Source,Team Fortress 2 Day of defet source, there are also many other textures out there to but the main ones are CSS and tf2 so get those games to and dont forget tf2 is a free game but counter strike is liek 10$ but the textures from that game are used alot so get CSS if youre looking to plat TTT or other games modes that have missing textures CSS will usaly fix them but there is also Gmod Tower that used the gmod tower addon. i hope you found this review helpfull. so i reccomend cheking the game out. alos check out some of my other reviews if you need help about the game.
SIMPLYBEAST1231;-;The best game ever. period!
|EZFC| Mudfart;-;this this THIS THIS! IS the best game ive ever played
Nyx;-;Garry's mod is one of the best Source Engine sandbox games, in which there's no goal or anything. In it all you do is screw around, play with ragdolls, play with friends and whatnot. It also has a Steam Workshop, with it you download the best ,,Modder's'' items and use them in your own game! There are various types of items such as playermodels, ragdolls, maps and more! I hightly reccomend this game. You should buy it and play some multiplayer with me heh.
V;-;take this game and play arond
I Don't Want To Go;-;Sleep....What is sleep....with this game sleep wont be necessary
Dr. Vakito;-;If this game was a potato, it would be a very good potato.
Lupus;-;Is a good game, with a lots of gamemodes! you should try the game with you dont have garrys mod
Mellow;-;best game u can buy, u get a 1000 games in one!!!
Bobirov;-;If you like to use your brain a bit and create odd machines out of random scrap or if you just want to make some silly screenshots using props and characters from other Valve titles then this is the game for you. At its core, Gmod is a sandbox style game where you are given various props, characters and construction materials and you are given the tools to place and fuse them together in a variety of ways. With those tools, you can make odd contraptions and vehicles or you can just place objects and characters to make silly scenes for screenshots or videos. Want to slap some car tires on a bath tub and have a race with your buddy? No problem. Want to construct a massive robot out of refrigerators and washing machines? Possible, if difficult. It is all up to you really. However, Gmod can be as complicated as you want it to be. With extensions like wiremod and other mods you can really get in-depth with the engineering/coding and design things like automatic machine gun turrets. Some of the built-in construction materials also lend themselves to building rather complex machines and structures. Gmod also has rather good integration of the Steam Workshop and you can use it to share your own creations or to check out other player's stuff. Gmod is most assuredly a game for the creative mind to express itself in a variety of ways.
Lord Foxy;-;Garry's Mod is a sandbox game, where there is no objectives, we just leave you the tools to play, your purpose is to make something that already exists or something that doesn't, it's up to you.
Panzynutz;-;This game is pretty much a Call of Duty remake. It has all the attributes of Call of Duty, except it is not as good. Call of Duty is no doubt the greatest game in the world. This game comes in a close 9th. It has amazing story mode and multiplayer. Just like Call of Duty. It is Call of Duty.
Zane;-;Garry's Mod, where do I begin? I remember when I first layed my eyes on GMod. I didn't know what something feeling "Sourcey" was. I got Steam just for Garry's Mod at first. Pretty sure next came Day of Defeat, but we will save that for another review thing. Garry's Mod was awesome, even with out addons and such I had a blast. Later on my friend showed me all about magical garrysmod.org. Took me a while to get used to downloading Addons, but I got the hang of it mostly. Garry's Mod was just getting more fun as I played. I would always jump on a map and create a little singleplayer mission with Npcs or such. Anyway, I remember joining my first Garry's Mod server, It was a Dark RP. I played for a while before joining any type of server. Me and my friend has no idea what we're joining. Once we got in it was awesome. Had a crap load of fun playing for hours. Then me and my friend would just play every weekend after weekend. Garry's Mod is endless, while you may say you can do anything, and yes you can. But, If that something you want to do isn't already created, It's up to you to code it! I really do recommend Garry's Mod, It's a must have. So much you can do on it, and for newer people to the interwebs It is now easier to use with the newest update moving it too Garry's Mod 13.
AARONAXELL;-;THIS IS WHAT THE GAMING COMMUNITY CAN DO IN IT'S GOLDEN FORM Please don't be fooled by what it looks like this game is brilliant with it's community pushing it, Anything can be done. Want to go back in time to germany and be Hitler himself? Well 1942 Roleplay is for you. Want to play it simple and be a Mayor? Welcome to DarkRP. Wanna be a terrorist and betray your comrades? Trouble in terrorist town. The large community lights up this game for being more than making half life 2 characters make funny faces. This game is one of the best on steam the possibilitys are endless this is the biggest sandbox game there is and the best community there is don't compare it to Minecraft this is far superior and ahead of it, Anyone who disagrees has not experienced Garry's Mod the correct way. Why are you reading this review? You know you have this in your library already and if you don't what's wrong with you? Now get off your Minecraft and your DayZ and your Dota 2 kids and explore the thousands of hours of fun this game can offer to you.
Kaneki-ken;-;Very fun game! Lots of diffrent ways to play! I reccommend it!
Gandalf The Grey;-;This game is one of the coolest game what i ever played and everyone who buy it ,then you never regret :P !!.

Weeaboo Shit;-;What happens when you grab source engine, a physics gun and a TON of mods? You get the most varied and addictive game you will play.
[SOREN];-;This game is really good to have to kill time when you're bored and you should get it.
Hyotenka 424;-;Played Father Grigori bowling. Killed my friend as Shrek with a lightsaber. Stuck a rocket up G-Man's  and sent him to the moon. 12/3.5 would Shrek is Love, Shrek is Life again.
Aelynthi;-;This is a must try! I'm not talking about graphics or anything of that, because I don't play games because their Graphics are beautiful. I play games for the gameplay, storyline, overall for the fun. Garry's Mod gives you a variety of different Game Modes. Like a lot of different Game Modes. You can even code your own Game Mode for Garry's Mod. A lot of things are possible in Garry's Mod!
Yoshi_138;-;Garry's Mod is a sandbox game which revolves around mods and the modding community. What kind of mods you ask? Gamemodes, weapons, maps, vehicles, npcs, tools, effects, player models, server content and more! Better yet, the game goes really cheap (2.49 usually) during sales so pick it up then, but I personally got it in a pack with Counter Strike but do whatever you want. tl:dr great game go buy it
DoomedYoshi;-;This game with mates, is the  =3
Crimson The Dragon;-;This game is awesome. It's full of randomness and prop kills and throwing bathtubs at yourself. Very majestic.

Moskau;-;So many things to do, so little time!!
Tinky My Winky;-;There is no true explaination for what Garrys Mod is. Garrys Mod is like your imagination. Think of anything you want and create it. want to make the fastest car ever? Then do it! Want to make a giant dinosaur that is made of bottles? Do it. Do you want to enjoy your life to the fullest with a successful career, beautiful family and money? Put that to the side and play GMod instead !

goodtuna;-;this game leaves you  more than your butt can afford
joey;-;good game to play
DyonisX;-;Pretty much a must have game...
Japple;-;One of the very few games that provides endless, and with that I really mean, ENDLESS, fun. It just simply can't get boring. The Workshop is full of oppertunities to keep the game fresh and due to its many gamemodes you have a wide range of playstyles for Garry's Mod. Absolutely a must-have for the average PC gamer.
DeadSloth;-;Got brains? Got friends with brains? Good! You'll have fun. Got neither? You'll still have fun.
WhiteBoiNiggaz;-;good game you will like it trust me there are a lot of gamemodes like darkrp it is like real life in game it is a really fun game if you get it go to my profile and say you like it or not and tell me why
Kek me;-;it is a realy fun game that is a sandbo and more like prop hunt and zombie survial and there are mods that you can add on to make the game more fun and you can play with freinds.
FNCE  Stoneybruh;-;great game
J7 Gaming;-;Well everyone knows and loves this game, but for those ( Few ) who don't here are some things about the game. It have single and multi player modes. it has gamemode like RP ( RolePlaying ), DarkRP, TTT ( touble in town ), SandBox ( Main Gamemode ), Jailbreak and may more. In single player there are a lot of thinsg to do ( Without Mods ). First you can make a house out of dushbins and sinks. Second you can put ragdolls in as people, but if you want you can put a NPC in or AI player which will follow you. But if you are looking for a War then you can add Combine NPC which will try to kill you and normal NPC's. Now to some mods. Have you every wanted to fly tons of planes the WAC is for you its is the best Mods making for planes. Now How bout some good guns, well the i recommed all gun mods because there awsome. Now for a ride look for Scars Slim, Basic, Extra for great cars, also Garry Mods on Wheels and TDM Car. But i give this game a loved... 10/10 - LOVE IT OR DIE
Ricards3 | Giveaway;-;Awesome game with lots of gamemodes made by people and super fun!
MonsterKitty;-;its GARRY'S MOD, need i say more?
MrFacehuger;-;10/10 Ruined my life
PixelFuzz;-;i was 12 years old. i watched countless videos on this game. i was practicly sweating over it. i played half life 2, i played counter strike as well. and now its time to play some gmod. it took hours of my life to download the game. i was kinda frusterated. but then i played. this game was beatuful. i almost cried, with a physics gun in hand i could do anything. the game was just perfect. nothing could make this game any better. i was wrong. i eventualy found out about online multiplayer. where you can build together with your freinds. i did. it was so fun i (once again) alomost cried. it was so much more fun with a second person. im not lonley anymore. i have freinds. i meet new freinds every day. everything was just swell then it crashed. i was confused. and mad, and sad. i couldnt play anymore, there was something wrong with my gmod game. i could never fix it. i could never play again.... 10/10
Christofu;-;I am a big fan of HL2 and all its predecessors. HL3 CONFIRMED. JK And this, in addition to my collection is just wonderful. I can now toy around with all the characters and do whatever I want, play gamemodes online and all. You can also get killed by melons 10/10
Hazard;-;It is an all around awesome and fun game with many modes. one of which modes is sandbox which is my favorite. Another mode is TTT aka Trouble In Terrorist Town. I won't go in depth on what the game modes are about, but I will list A few more. One of the other modes is murder, and another is DarkRP. Sandbox is a game mode where you can do whaat ever you want, and on sandbox if you have the correct addons you want, you have endless or infinte possibilities. the only way to not have endless possibilites is lack of imagination, so it is really fun and that will conclude this review.
[GRPL] Evinton;-;Best 8 euros you can spend on steam. The sole definiton of slapstick humor. I love this game.
freeman;-;love the game... hate the gamers in it >_>
darkwarrior696;-;Best game.Cant tell something else.Just amazing
sonicsocool101;-;its the best game i have ever play.
Homo Erectus;-;I spawned trains on my friend while constantly spamming "GET TRAINED BIT|CH!" and he ragedquit. 10/10
AG Juan #RTDMG;-;Downloading Simulator. 75% of the hours you play in this game are spent downloading.
Dog;-;An incredible game. Garry's mod isn't just a sandbox, it's a first-person shooter, a zombie survival, an obsticle coarse, a war-zone- if you can think of it than it's there. Personally i don't like sandboxes but this games is everything you could possibly imagine. You can kill your friends, make new friends and kill those friends too. You're only limited by your own imagination. The possibilities are endless.
Shadow;-;Probably the best Source Engine Sandbox you can find. Offers lots of ways to experiment with the engine's physics, allows people to learn and understand how the engine works and it's pretty much the only game where people can create anything imaginable. With the appropriated addons such as Wiremod or SProps or ACF, a lot of building related tool addons, people are able to learn to build replicas of existing vehicles, to simulate realistic physics, to simulate aerodynamics, create their own games (I myself have a hologram-designed chess in GMod.) or, as seen on many youtube videos, create animation videos with ragdolls. I only have to warn about the majority of the Sandbox community. Don't expect most of the people being mature, calm and firm. They are far from that. The rather small building/coding-community however, is the exact opposite of what people nowadays see running around on GMod servers. GMod basically is the place where you can create bikes, cars, planes, boats, jets, helicopters, quadro/hexa/octa-copters, pixel-artworks by aligning tons of cubes, spend your time on Lua because GMod's workshop offers three major lua sandboxes (Expression 2 in Wiremod, Expression Advanced 2 on Github, Starfall on Github). If anyone wishes to see some impressions, people are free to visit my friends Jackpody, Rucamad, Damianu on YouTube, visit the Wiremod forum or look for servers where builders can be found on.
[GL]catst;-;best building game ever! you can do sandbox or ttt (the game's games).what can you play that is NOT the game's game,that is what is called,gamemodes.the most played gamemode i think is darkrp.you can modufiy sandbox with addons.the most cilcked addon is wires mod.some peaple make gmod movies but more peaple jest do photo shop instead.alot of gamemodes need two or more player to start like zombie survival,in zombie survival one player playes as a zombie and 1 other player playes as a person.the person go hiding,blocking or attacking.the zombie,attack.if you are thinking that "i sot you sed this is a building game NOT a game/game/game/game!". the building part of the game is in sandbox and that is the game's mane and the first gamemode for my that makes it a building game.i sey you shoed play this game so you know all the stuff that comes out of this game.(p.s all my friend have garry's mod XD).
CRZY;-;It's filled with people who think they're geniuses, children who think they're original, a majority of the people think they're comedy gold, a whole lot more strive to kill anything above them, and even more of them just want to enjoy the game, but can't because of the previously mentioned people. The problem with Gmod is that there's no unifying base behind it, so the community is left to create their own game, the result is modern day Gmod, at the end of it's life, about to completely fizz out, on life support by the veterans who are determined to see it through to the end. I'd still reccomend this game to anyone who wants to build stuff of  around with coding and modeling, just don't get into really involved stuff like HL2RP, it'll cause you more drama then one person should ever have to endure.
jamesgryffindor99;-;This game is pretty awesome :)
Sa1F *Lookin4team;-;This is worth all of what you have in your wallet, YOU WILL NEVER REGRET THIS
TheLegendaryZombieKiller;-;Gmod is the best sandbox game or mod ever theres so much to do. when im board i just play gmod to past the time. so many people play this it's not that kind of mod that have like 20 people online at the same time. i defenly recomend this game or mod what ever you want to call it if you dont have this game i fell bad for you.
Mo_lester;-;I killed a person with a melon. 11/10
Realiity;-;My favorite game on steam. Between TTT and doing whatever the hell you want, this game is a masterpiece.
bubble tea and rice;-;YO MAN MY FRIEND SEE ME PLAYING THIS 24/7
[T.I.] Lady Ivy;-;I find Gmod to be a very "open" game. it's full of so many different oppertunities. It could be shooting friends in the face or building a bathtub covered in thrusters and explosives, but whatever you decide to do, its possibe.
Rick Harrison;-;Garry's Mod has one of the most (if not the most) well-updated communities of any game. The game was made in 2006 and the different weapons, gamemodes and maps are still being created every day. Not to mention all of the servers dedicated to any gamemode you like. A good game for a new PC gamer, or an old one. And you can get killed by Watermelons. 10/10
Swoodius Maximus;-;I have no idea what i am doing. Garry/10
ak_boarder;-;Do you love minigames inside of games? Well then this game is for you. Never have I laughed so hard with my friends.
EH_killer603;-;one of the best game that you can fined on steam. full of servers (it was release in 2006 and still contain thousands of servers everyday. everything:10/10 highly recommanded note: if you fail in school and you are very sad,go buy it.
Snake (  );-;its a really good game it has gamemodes like TTT DarkRP Murder Hide n seek Sandbox the community is bad tho and it needs a ton off addons i have 346 addons [Don't need to dowload into alot off servers]
RaKaN4GaMER #HappyEid;-;I LIKE This Game !
Stiff Pete;-;This game is great
Wittloc;-;Playing this game vanilla can get a bit boring, but what makes it as popular as it is? The wide range of addons from Steam Workshop.
ryan;-;Although it is a "mod", Garry's Mod feels like a stand alone game as it just uses basic resources of CS:S, HL2 and TF2. With a sandbox single player and an exciting multiplayer, you will never get bored of playing this. It is a stable game, but feels as if it is always in Beta as lag and long loading times will occur with any pc system you use, but you can get used to that. Some times crashes but all in all still a great game. Make sure you purchase CS:S with it and if you don't, you can download the textures it uses anyway for free. 8.8/10 Needs to be a bit more stable. Would Recommend.
SuchNathan;-;This is Garry's Mod or GMod. It is an amazing Source Sandbox game with tons of different mods and addons that make it more exciting. Alos, Sandbox isn't the only gamemode, there is a wide variey of gamemodes ranging from TTT (Troouble in Terrorist Town) to Hunger Games. I'd reccomend getting TF2 and CS;Source before buying this game as it bring in a lot of new resources to GMod. Overall, this is game i fantastic. ****

[Vodka];-;Been playing this game for ages, it's pretty good. Always a good choice of gamemodes, you should buy this.
989phoenix;-;this game is awsome ive loved it since i got it
Milo;-;I have played garry's mod for a very long time. Warning right now if you are going to get the game you will NEED counter strike soruce unless you want to play only singleplayer. You can still play multiplayer without css but you will have no textures and you can't even see where you are. This game combinds a lot of the soruce made games like half life series along with counterstrike soruce with some portal. This can be fun for doing endless asortment of things on sandbox like screwing around with the charecters the physics like changing the gravity to installing addons or gamemodes that have a huge effect on the game. This reminds me of minecraft in a way because minecraft once you get board of it you can just mod it to turn it more interesting. Game still has not gotten old to me and I personaly think it is the best game I have ever played so far. I highly recomend this game the only downside I can think of is when you are going on servers with a lot of addons like darkRP sometimes how they interact with your client/game can make it glitchy and cause problems. This is easy to fix usauly just some lua errors. Deffinitly have to buy this game if you are considering it. I have somewhere around 558 hours on the game.
Broadcasting Grey Zarcovski;-;In my opinion Garrys mod is a Very Amusing game that is definetly worth the price . It allows creativity and the fun of just playing around with games that are mixed together like My little pony with Call of duty black ops. The choices of gamemodes are amazing like Dark roleplay or Stop it slender. Its workshop shows that the community and creativity of the members is amazing and that people will never stop supporting and creating mods for the game. My Verdict on this game is that it is Amazing and it is worth playing.~Grey Zarcovski 11/18/2014

[SNARF]Fritz Smith;-;G-mod is a creative game with different kinds of modes and DLC modes. The modes that you start with are Sandbox,and Trouble in Terrist Town. Sandbox is what the name impliys it`s a Sandbox. BUT, it has very famillyer games by Valve like...Team Fortress 2,Half Life,and Portal. And you can choose stuff from the dupes minu wich has community builds and some of them can be AWSOME and others... wat.So ya. TTT is a game mode were sombody is the traitors and their job is to kill the enimeys with out being noticed and when they kill everybody then they WIN! The freandlies job is to kill the traitors and nobody knows who is the trader and who is a freandlie so this makes for a iteresting gamemode My over all rank for this game is 7 physis guns/10 I hoped that you enjoyed my review of, Garrys Mod
officer fort;-;this is the :) game i have playd
Dark Helmet;-;I've had this game for as long as I can remember, hell, look, I have 600 hours. When the vanilla game gets boring, you have an endless butt of mods. When you're bored of the mods, the community is great. Best buy on steam.

Ben Hanson!;-;It is a fantastic game you can play with your freinds and download a TON of cool stuff but not too mutch or the game will go slow but apart from that it is BRILLIANT!!
TheHotAngel;-;Anyone who likes game where you can do what the hell you want? Build what ever you feel like, where you''ll never get bored? This is the game which gets you hooked, and in a good way I mean :3 this is the 1st game I ever played, I fell inlove with it, have played more then 1700h, its about year since i bought this game and im still not bored of it =) there is so many different ''mini'' games what you can play, like Sandbox , TTT, Prop Hunt, Murder, Pedobear Hunt, MelonBomber, Dark Rp etc, but the only thing which is recomended, you should also get CSS (Counter Strike Source ) and TF2 installed so you see maps on certain gamemodes. What else should I say, just relax have fun and enjoy this game =)

PsychoticFlame;-;Garry's Mod is the best thing that ever happend to me in my life and Ive met so many great people as well and its so much fun.
Gary the Sylveon;-;pretty good game
SubMariner;-;If you happen to be high while reading this you are highly misinformed
zane malic;-;Probably the worst game I have ever played.
WOOFLE;-;Jailbreak makes me screech like a 3 year old.
Findickly Cuss;-;I love this stupid game. Its has hours of content and is forever changing.
Risqu Kam-L;-;Indescribably the most, stupid, funny, hilarious, random, most entertaining game I've EVER PLAYED! I payed 10 dollars not knowing what it was truley about, but it was all worth it. Garry's Mod, incase you don't know, Is supposed to be Sandbox (where you create your own thing, but in this case it's props from the series "Half Life"). Or, you can go online, you can play sandbox there too with people, and play other games that will keep you playing! You'll have to see, but it is for sure, the best game I've ever gotten. 10/10. If you get 10 dollars, don't hesitate, buy it... :)
ParadoxicalLogic;-;It's a great way to get into sandbox games if you're getting bored of Minecraft or GTA 5. I've clocked over 30 hours on this game since it's impossible for me to get bored. The community keeps the game fresh by adding more and more excellent content and WIPs to the workshop every single day. There are some violent aspects of it, however, but that doesn't mean one has to participate in them. If you're honestly that sensitive to violence in gaming, play Minecraft instead. Getting bored in-game? Get more content to use.
Rydli;-;I have no clue as to what's going on but I love it anyways.
Sprite;-;Best building game ever. Highly recommend it.
Meme Maid;-;Garry's Mod. Possibly One of The Best Games I Ever Played. (Most words had to start with a CAPITAL letter because it's true.) Garry's Mod is known for many things, such as animation, gamemodes, addons, SHREK, TF2, the first game to feature a gamemode where you are a terrorist looking for traitors, StAbInG! RolePlay, First Source Game NOT Produced by Valve, Murder, Blowing up Melons, First Person Shooter, Clockwork RP (super scary RP), PropHunt, Guns, Trampolines, Turtles, garry :D, Dupes, Dynomite, WireMod, SANIC, Batman, Having a simular name to a Generic Model Organism Database or GMOD, being riped off on many devices, MENECROFT! Vanoss, Venturian Tale, Homestuck, Homostuck, PWNIEZ!!! (not to offend the pony community, nor the homestuck comunity, Tornados, Doctor Who? a person with Mr, Burns with a mustace as a profile picture (who developed Insurgency, I think.) Tumblr, YouTube, FacePunch Studios, THE LORD AND SAVIOR GARRY! and more. (+). But originally started as a sandbox game via 'a modding website' witch would soon be brought to steam and be sold for currency. witch then made millions, witch then was added 'Trampoline', witch then made it to the Steam Workshop along with Garry's Mod Vr. 13 or "GMOD 13", witch then made more money, witch then created our lord and savior Garry. Over 9000/5 Stars. It was Ok. -a very over yet under excaderate indivitual.
WhiskeyOrange;-;Very good, much reccommend.
BradManDango;-;Got told my server was bad. Crashed his Gmod with Lua errors. ------------------------------------------------- Became admin on server. Found out all staff where 9. ------------------------------------------------- Spawned baby's as hobo. Got robbed. ------------------------------------------------- Played game for 1000 hours. Still cant use half the tools. 8 / 8
GINGANINJA323;-;This is a very unique and creative game which is full of possibilities and allows players to do what they want rather than being forced to follow objectives. The game supplies you with lots of building resources to, well, build stuff! It also supplies constraints to help you with building. I have enjoyed many hours using this game as you can see. I would score this game a 10/10.
Nasty;-;+5 For game idea. +5 For Source engine 10/10 I love it
TacticalBaconz;-;Wasted my bandwidth on addons 10/10
Snake (  );-;its a really good game it has gamemodes like TTT DarkRP Murder Hide n seek Sandbox the community is bad tho and it needs a ton off addons i have 346 addons [Don't need to dowload into alot off servers]

Wittloc;-;Playing this game vanilla can get a bit boring, but what makes it as popular as it is? The wide range of addons from Steam Workshop.
Sikh;-;jerked off to the workshop 69/10
SuchNathan;-;This is Garry's Mod or GMod. It is an amazing Source Sandbox game with tons of different mods and addons that make it more exciting. Alos, Sandbox isn't the only gamemode, there is a wide variey of gamemodes ranging from TTT (Troouble in Terrorist Town) to Hunger Games. I'd reccomend getting TF2 and CS;Source before buying this game as it bring in a lot of new resources to GMod. Overall, this is game i fantastic. ****

DetectiveFox;-;Great Game to play with friends. DarkRP and trouble in terrorist town are the best game modes personally . I would buy this game if i were you and its cheap.
Oh mai!;-;Amazing game, truly a game to be remembered by many. Lets players enjoy hundreds of game modes including the ever so popular Trouble In Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt where you hide as an object and get hunted down or you hunt people yourself and many more! A great game with great physics enabling for realistic gameplay. A Steam Classic.

[HS] Tesh;-;Really fun game, I staffed on a server HS for more then half a year. Sad to see it go R.I.P HS
Broadcasting Grey Zarcovski;-;In my opinion Garrys mod is a Very Amusing game that is definetly worth the price . It allows creativity and the fun of just playing around with games that are mixed together like My little pony with Call of duty black ops. The choices of gamemodes are amazing like Dark roleplay or Stop it slender. Its workshop shows that the community and creativity of the members is amazing and that people will never stop supporting and creating mods for the game. My Verdict on this game is that it is Amazing and it is worth playing.~Grey Zarcovski 11/18/2014

Bones. Don't Rattle 'Em.;-;do you enjoy running around screaming at children and autists while children and autists scream at you? this is the game for you
MaxOfS2D (see you at TI5);-;The best Source engine toolbox there is.
Nawrusi;-;How do you review this? This is Garry`s mod, and the game can be whatever you like. As the game`s titel states the game is about modding and chainging whatever you fell like, this game has no rules and no boundires, you can do whatever you like. Let`s talk a bit more specific. You can put down any item person or ragdoll, from games like half life, Team Fortress 2, Counter Strike and more, from there you can make these item`s do whatever you want to, put them togehter animate them, make new mecanics, and so on. Whatever you choose to do, you can always film it, or make an item and put it out so the public can use it. There has also been build mods to Garrys`s mod, there have been quit pupular, such as Trouble in Teorist Town, and Prop Hunt, but many more mods and idears are out there, and maybe you can even make your own. This game is a game you want to play, if you have friends that you want to be a bit random with, or if you are creativ so you can make great items. This game is a fenominom, and everybody has either heard of it, or have the game. How can I not give this game a thumps up? It has everything! 7 out of 10
Kenneth;-;The only game you won't suck at! Buy it, n00b.
Magikarp;-;Great sandbox game, awesome fun with friends. The range of multiplayer modes proves how good the game is. I recommend it to anyone looking for another game.

For the first couple days you wont know what to do so have friends help u ~ When you do ITS FUN. Prop Hunt is amazing you can mess around with people and move under hunter's feet its a trolling gamemode too.! There is also sandbox When you can create anything possible. Btw if you needed some addons for Weapons,NPCS,Player models or EVEN MAPS go to main menu Then click workshop or go on steam workshop. So yes i would recommend this so buy it!
little boi tyrone;-;its perfect... imagine five nights at freddies littering the saves page of a game and a simple car that you can just spawn yourself also filling the workshop Oh and do you not like 3 year olds filling the community? to bad. oh and also you know what is even more awesome? the hl2rp servers it has got to be the scariest game mode out there, you get treatened to get hacked within 4 1/2 seconds of joining if you do not like any of this, than leave steem and goe get a liif
[UG] Magicviper (On Vacation);-;Great Game to play with friends
Ruste;-;One of the best games I have ever played, recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it. Many, many hours of fun.
Sherlock Van Helsing;-;Create objects in Sandbox Mode, make dogfights battles, kill terrorists in Trouble In Terrorist Town, survive horror levels, kill zombies, create characters and more. This is Garry's Mod. SCORE: 94/100
Mikasa;-;OVERALL: 67% Gameplay & Controls: 4/5 s Graphics & Visuals: 3/5 s Music & Audio: 3/5 s Part of Garry's Mod's lasting popularity stems from just how many things you can do with it. The number of game modes available is absolutely astounding, even more so when you realize that all of them were created by members of the community. It's an incredibly vibrant game, and if time has proven anything, it's that its players are capable of just about anything. -Gameplay & Controls- Your experience will change from server to server, depending on game mode, but among the most popular modes are Murder, Prop Hunt, and Trouble in Terrorist Town  or TTT, as it is affectionately referred to by its many fans. The first plays out more or less like a virtual game of Clue, while the second is a bout of hide and seek where those who are hiding can transform themselves into a copy of one of various items hidden around the map. TTT, meanwhile, is similar to Murder except everyone has weapons to defend themselves, and players cooperate to attempt to inform each other who the traitor is in their midst. Other game modes can range from a full-on clone of DayZ to human battleship, a testament to players ingenuity. The only thing stopping me from giving the gameplay of Garrys Mod a five is the same aspect which can make playing it so much fun: the community. While many members are quite engaging and friendly, there are always some others out there determined to ruin the experience of everyone else they play with. Whether through hacking their client or harassing other players, this small minority can easily wreck whatever game mode you happen to be playing, and good luck trying to get an admin on to do anything about it. -Graphics & Visuals- Garrys Mod runs on Valves decaying source engine, and, while powerful, its age is becoming increasingly apparent. The visuals dont necessarily detract from the experience to be had, and some players have made an effort to introduce custom player models and textures, some of which look quite nice. Again, however, the engine itself is dated, so please be aware of that before you play. Something else of note is that this game cant really be run unless you have a Valve-made source engine game installed in your library. This is because, as the name suggests, Garrys Mod is in fact one giant mod that pulls all of its textures and resources from other games. There are (illegal) ways around this, but the truth is that unless you get the necessary files on your system one way or another, youre going to be missing the majority of the games textures. Which is Valves way of saying pony up the extra cash, unless you enjoy everything in alternating shades of black and pink. -Music & Audio- Most of the tracks and sounds in the game are supplied by source, though other songs are supplemented through Garrys Mods ever-expanding Workshop. Most of these end up collectively as taunts in game modes such as Prop Hunt, and they honestly make up the greatest part of the experience. However, sounds such as those are often limited to certain game modes, with others being almost silent except for the sounds of your fellow players mics, which is rather unfortunate given all of the sound effects that have been added to the game over the years. -Final Thoughts- Honestly, its a good game, especially when youre playing with friends. It can really be a lot of fun, and its always something to do if you dont have anything else to do. The sheer amount of game modes is perhaps the greatest selling point, though considering the fact that you have to own a source game in order to properly play, I really dont think its worth $9.99. Itll often go on sale around the holidays for a fraction of that price, so if you happen to see it drop below $5.00 I would definitely pick it up if you get the chance. Just beware of the trolls hiding in the communitys crevices.
Copy That;-;Like Minecraft with less autism and more kids.
KnavishMammal;-;Great game, really worth the 10-20$ for it. A Mic is recommend for this game if you want to play multiplayer

Lazlo;-;It's an awesome game that lives up to it's description. This sandbox title lets you do it all, whether it's driving a car across the peaceful highways, to posing an Engineer kicking a Spy in the balls, to flinging all sorts of characters across maps with custom-built catapults, you can do anything that you can. The only limits are your imagination and the limits of the Source engine.
KJelles [Camel];-;Hitboxes are ed up, most buggy  game, but i keep on playing xD

Volum3;-;Garry's Mod.. This is one of those games where playing online or solo just doesn't matter. It's just about creating something, whether or not it's funny, can fly, can drive, you can make anything. Not to mention the plethora of addons, gamemodes, tools and NPCs. The choices of what to do in this game are endless. 10/10
WumboCumbo;-;Garry's Mod has mods. And It's Better then COD. You can spawn a Pod. And i dont know what else that rhymes with Mod......Gud Game!
Sweet Crap;-;By far the best game in the steam, damm.
xKatn1ss;-;Garry's Mod, a game where everything is possible. From building cars, so on and so forth to creating works of art. In Sandbox, you could invite your friends and have some fun together. Other than Sandbox, there are special gamemodes made, like : Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Jailbreak, keeping the game interesting.
burritobrine;-;fun great and easy to mod

Orange Box Nerd Senior;-;Never have I ever found such a random game, that has games within games. You can never get bored with it. From the popular Trouble in Terrorist Town to the classic sandbox mode, it has everthing you possibly think of(including Slenderman and DayZ). When I first heard the name Garry's Mod, i unintentionally said "What is that?" friends told me to go search up videos made using Gmod, and I instantly fell in love with it. If you are thinking of buying this game, don't hesitate. Buy it immediately. 5 out of 5
FPW-SIRNINJACAT;-;buy this game if you want to waste the rest of your life.TRUST ME.

Jarv;-;Hello peoples (Yes I said peoples,  you). Today I shall tell you a story. A story of wonder, adventure, and a lot of young sexual content. Stick with me, its not that bad. So, one day, Mrs.Creativity was cutting her wrists because no one liked her anymore. Her sexual life was a mess, she had not been "tickled" in years. So she went for a walk, trying to decide which building she would jump of. BUT, MY CHILDREEN, Something unexpected happend! She was kidpanned by a very evil man named Garry. Garry had really weird sexual fetishes and he was a wanted man. When Mrs.Creativty woke up, she was all naked locked in a room. She looked around and she saw two men. One of them was called Imagination and he had a strange feel to him. Like if anything was possible. Then the other man had an aged look. He was called Physics and he seemed really strict. The two man ware naked and they made sweet love () to creativity, while Garry told them what to do. In the end, criativity got pregnant, and 9 months later, when she had gone to all post--stress help groups, a beautiful thing was born. Criativity called it Garry's Mod for who the  knows why. And she decided to make clones of her baby and sell him on a really dodgy company called steam. Everyone loved the clones and used them as sex toys. They are dirty cheap but they are damn good sex dols. Buy YOUR garrys mod now! It will be worth it! I promise! (Feel free to intepretate this stupid  in any way you see fit)
Toa Onua;-;This is the best Sandbox, RPG, FPS, Fighting, Plaform, MMOG, Action, Horror, Racing, Party, Puzzle game ever. A must have for all gamers
partyrock201;-;Garry's Mod is truly a game that shows what a group of people with creativity can make. The makers did a magnificent job of making a SandBox game that combines the creativity of making large, magnificent things and making it so it can be distributed to other creative players looking for inspiration. From it's wide variety of gamemodes to it's amazing Mod community, it just go's to show that people can truly do anything and everything and put it in one game.
fourdii;-;>Package up a server >Find a few friends >Input a few mods >Maybe watch a few videos with the Cinema Gamemode >blow crap up with crap >construct stuff with crap >roleplay with crap Thats GMOD in a nutshell.
Ludvig;-;Pretty cool. The worst part of this "game" is describing it to non-gamers or people who simply missed it (console peasants).
Pope Francis;-;Still cant find Garry, but still would play again!
Stormy;-;Garry's mod is extremely fun and I would recomend it to anyone! The variety of gamemodes are interesting and make it difficult to ever get bored with the game. The formatting and the ease in finding servers are other positive attributes. But, my very favorite aspects to gmod are the community and communication with other players. Whenever I play, I look forward most to talking to friends and having a great time!
BananaCoconuts;-;Ruined my life 10/10
TsunaKydo;-;Such a good game. If you have ever felt the need for escapism then its here in Garry's mod. With such a proud and dedicated mod community its hard to find something bad in this game because you can do a lot in Garry's mod. Also with online functions the game really shines in its multiplayer modes such as Trouble in terroist Town and Prop Hunt, playing these with your friends is a blast and really enjoyable when you are trying to find something new to do. So yeah, this game is definitely worth its price, although I reccomend the Counter Strike Source pack as that allows you to use its features a lot better.
[MI6] DoubleG;-;Awesome game !!! It's like all games in one ! You can create everything you want, but first you need to learn how to do it. first, it was little bit hard, but then.....
Sasha Spilberg;-;This game is funny and hapyy

Icarus;-;the meme that keeps on giving
Dead_Island_Dude;-;There is no way that you can truly dislike Garry's Mod. Since the game is mostly based off of the Steam Workshop, it can be whatever you make of it. The possibilities are endless in GMod, so I highly suggest this game. Like every game though, the somewhat childish community is the only negative.
suicidejunkie;-;I hate this game.

FreeManMeta;-;A fantastic physics sandbox with a very active community. Daily uploads and thousands of mods and addons available through the workshop make it a very versatile and fun game that should definitely not be missed. Is what I would say if it wasn't the go to game of every 8 year old steam child.

Klizmotron;-;Absolutely a wonderfull game. I recommend it to everyone who did not try it yet. You'll find something you will like, here you can build, kill, play role games and do any other things which you can only imagine. Potential of this game has no bounds, there are tones of servers with differend gamemodes running, hundreds of thousands players playing, pile of content from steam workshop and other source engine games like CS:GO or Portal 2. If you like using your imagination and having lots of fun - this game is what you're looking for!
Delux;-;You can be a bathtub, unrealistic.
COCKLOVER69;-;it has a openable fridge.
Awemega Maxi;-;got killed by a balloon 10/10
JAMEs;-;It's pretty boring. Servers are . Players are usually 40 year old men. I like kids that play it. I r8 an 8/8
Sharky;-;Building stuff is fun. Do it.
THE_KING;-;I Like This Game
Sean #IHAVESPLATOONBITCHES;-;Extremely fun and addicting, with non-stop gameplay, as there is allways SOMETHING new! It is for those constructive, those who want to make some funny stuff, those who want some awesome combat, and everything else! This game can be whatever you want it to be, and when done right, you can make some of the most hilarious stuff! With a great community, a large array of gamemodes, tons of addons, and cool stuff to play with, the game is never old! You could be a constructor and build maps, or you can be someone who just enjoys killing monsters with friends, you can play around in a hilarious game of prop hunt, stay tense in murderer, play with friends in a deathmatch, and anything you can imagine! If you look up on youtube people like kitty0706 or Das Bo Schitt, you can find some really hilarious stuff, made in gmod! So go on, its worth the money, really!
RandomTBush;-;Garry's Mod -- the all-in-one sandbox game. Whether it's movies, screenshots, or just mucking about in general, Garry's Mod should keep you (and others) entertained for a long time. Also, it's $10. Instead of pirating it (like I know a bunch of other people have), just don't buy that pizza you wanted today, and you should have enough for it.
CommanderBronyStalin;-;One of the most creative games Ive ever played and also one of the most HILARIOUS. The modding community is amazing and the amount of gamemodes you can play online like murder,TTT,Dark RP,Prop hunt are great. Alos the amount of maps you can get is endless! Although I must warn people that hosting a private server for you and your friends is complicated and you might need help for it. Final verdict: 10/10 (Primarily for the amount of time you can have fun with it)
SaudiBear;-;who needs life when you have this
SenpaiSophie;-;Amazing game anytime you're bored gmod will fix you up!
el cinto;-;u kno dis is a good game when theres an achievement you get for receiving programming errors
The Great White North;-;Great game that brings your creativity out into the open. A sandbox game developed for teen and mature players. However, there seem to be a lot of kids in this game and some people may find this annoying. If you're into sandbox games, roleplaying, etc, then you'll like this game. This game has many gamemodes that keep growing everyday. You can write your own gamemodes if you wanted to, but that would take quite a while. There are many fun gamemodes out there like DarkRP, TTT and Jailbreak. Get this game and you won't regret buying it, it's quite a cheap price too with the current summer sale going on! You might want to get CS:S along with this, because there is a lot of content that uses CS:S. HL2:EP1, HL2:Ep2 are also great games that go along with this.
Klutch;-;What the hell am i doing with my life
ostySpi~<3;-;Great game for passing time!
Batz;-;I play FAR too much of this. Help me D: its calling my name..IT KNOWS I"M HERE! Send hel..
Leon #ThugLife;-;the best game
Mr.Quiggles;-;Garry's mod is a great game, especially for messing around. This game features 2 main features, a singleplayer sandbox and a multiplayer world of online mods, easily organized and countless fun. DL speeds could be better though (It's not me).
Scott Howson;-;Real fun game to play as long as you have CSS, and better with friends.
Waffle is too Kawaii;-;Really fun game to play around with friends!
JOEVILLE;-;It's the best game i've ever played!!!!
Sergeant Lawson;-;I installed so many add-ons that I could no longer stop the Sesame Street Militia from hunting down the sorority strippers. I regret nothing. 11/10 would mindf**k my RAM again
Paradox<3;-;pwety cuel
Vito Corleone;-;It has stuff in it. And it's also a game. It's also good. Watermelon.
Razgraz;-;9/10 moms recommend Garrysmod + Counter Strike: Source bundle (Dead joke now since steam removed the damn bundle, wtf steam really?) But really, I have capped 2,000+ hours in this game, And I don't regret a single moment, Buy this along with the must have (seriously a must have or your game will be half  with missing textures) Counter Strike Source. There is so much to do in this game, and I should know this the best of many people, it doesn't matter how many hours you've put into this game, there is no chance you have played every gamemode, seen every big and little mod on workshop, and there's no way you can have as much fun in this game on a LAN server with friends than any other game. You truly will never see the end of this mod any time soon with its ever growing community of mods and modders. A must have for STEAM, 10/10.
GoldenPuppzy36;-;Garry's Mod is a really good game , very fun sandbox game and good texturing , Gmod's servers use a different gamemode which alows different things that u can do and can't do Gmod is great , 8/10
UberCat;-;Awesome game. You can create your own world in this. Servers with differnent modes are good. Highly recommended.
Chaka;-;You can make  car and spam watermelon, I like water melon, Watermelon is life, Watermelon is love. 10/10
The Reaper Halican;-;If you have not played this game well you can't say you haved lived. It is so amazing and fun I can't say it enough. I love it and I am sure you will too. It is a sandbox with alot of minigames. My fav being TTT. They are also games like murder or pirate ship wars that are really fast paced. 10/10 for sure.
XCANMA;-;this is an awesoem game ive bin playing it for a while now and i really just love it you should totaly check it out . you can do all most anything in it
chrissy;-;Err, it's great.?

B R A V E;-;THIS GAME IS A ING SANDBOX!
Fade;-;its a awesome sandbox game for the people who really have nothing elsce to do.
naefin;-;This game is fun on its own but with its thriving community of modders it has a infinite replayability rate.
Khael;-;This is one of my favourite games. There are great game modes to play with friends. So many mods that various people create on workshop. Garry's mod is a game of endless fun!
solidemike;-;Countless type of games modes, a great community and you can even create all sorts of things. It's hard to let go of garry's mod and there's always something new to discover. With friend or on you own, you'll still enjoy this game because you'll always ended up meeting fun peoples and have a blast. The only letdown (even thougt it's justified in a way) is that, to get the full experience, you absolutely need other games sources like Counter-Strike and Half-Life which are sold seperately. And even though it's not that often, i stumbled upon different kind of bugs (like game crashing, lags, bugged/misplaced interface), they make the game inconvenient here and there but not enought to ruin the experience.
Frog;-;Spent 6 hours in a basement cooking meth on DarkRP.
K1ngCraft;-;Not many games allow you to be this creative. With a large list of game types to choose from and hundreds of community made mods, the possibilities are almost endless! Practise building in singleplayer or with friends on a Sandbox server! Take on the role of a Civil Protection Officer in DarkRP keeping the streets safe or, not so safe! Have a little "Who done it?" with the Murder or TTT game types. Still need something new to do? No worries there! Download a custom map or addons from the Steam Workshop! And enjoy them alone or with friends! Its hard to get bored of this creative game which is why is has led to being one of the most popular series on my channel! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azRxgafiKLU So pick it up! It's a must have in any gamers Steam library.
Booney;-;Got called a  by a 9 year old. I threw a chair at that . 10/10
Noel Riley;-;This game is awesome on multiplayer. Of course the bhop! Of julian i've got miku right there I give this game a 10/10 Metascore! this game is awesome with the workshop entities to download. Even the gameplay. The gamemodes are awesome. But i got scared on yesterday (Wednesday 3 december) by a horror map. A scary shark just shooted in my face. What i can tell anymore? Ah right. The game isnt getting me bored of 300 hours of play! Thanks FacePunch for the good support! note: my loading on multiplayer freezes my game sometimes. The loading score i give is 4/10 But still the game is great!
Derpy Whooves;-;It's fun, It's great, It's Gmod. Everybody knows about it. What else to say?
Mellow;-;Totally Awesome Game! You can do anything in this Game Would do again spawn many watermellon. Spawn Over a billion props 111/10
ThatCrazyGuy;-;Garry's Mod is extremely good game considering how long it has been out for. Even though the graphics are old and can't beat games like Battlefield 4 that's not what makes me want keeping playing this game. It's the community that keeps me coming back for more when it comes to Garry's Mod as spending even a short amount of time on Gmod can change what would be a boring friday night into a fun and entertaining one as there is plenty of games to play and huge community of people waiting for you. Personally i would reccomend this game as it has given me the kind of fun that i have not seen from a game for a while and it is game that will live on for years to come.
Yamato Bellic;-;I don't know how to explain that feeling When my internet is dead, I played it in Singleplayer When I have internet, I played too many gamemode in Garry's mod This game make me love it Even I'm bored, no gf, Friend got gf and more You can even play it and erased your bad feeling /me still tryin to kill gman

Isuckatgaming;-;Spawn ca. 30 marines with M4s and shotguns. Spawn 300 zombies. In a destroyed apoctolyptic city. 10/10 would do again.
Paradox Draco IN SPAIN;-;Good fun. Good friends. Good community drama.
Boobytrap Chowderpants;-;might have to give it a couple of more hours before i decide whether it's worth recommending
The Doge #Road2Unusual;-;Amazing But We Need To Get Rid Of The FNAF Fans!!
Mexican Hitman;-;A very optomized and playable game, hours of fun and laughter, its cheap and is very easy to run, considering its on the HL2 engine, gitches may occur like mods not showing up or not being able to use mods. but overall is an excellent game that is a must buy. 9/10 (   )
Xelatross;-;Garry's Mod is a sandbox game where a player can basically to anything they want. That's right, anything. A player can spawn NPCs, build creations, design weapons, create enviroments, or just do what you want. This game is prepared for a majority of what the community of this game has in store for it, so it can take a lot of big things. However, it is prone to crashing (exiting the game without you doing it) unexpectedly. But one the bright side, this game allows players to have fun doing whatever the heck they want to do. One can position ragdolls in funny positions will comedic faces. Or one can go up against a zombie horde and try to survive with a certain loadout of guns. The possibilities are about endless! Now, if one gets bored of doing anything they want or is just not into positioning ragdolls, there is another way to having fun with this game. There are gamemodes out there in Garry's Mod that people can play with other people in a fun (and sometimes intense) server. One gamemode is called Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT). In this game mode, there are a cartain amount of innocent terrorists in a certain map. Now, in this band of innocents are traitors. The traitor's mission: Eliminate all the innocents. The innocent's mission: Eliminate the terrorists. Seems simple, right? Well, not really. No one knows who the traitors migh be. It could be anyone, it could even be the player itself! No one knows at first...until the chaos begins. You see, the traitors have some weapons that the innocents don't have at first, such as a knife, silent pistol, traitor sniper, C4, or a jihad (suicide bomb). The traitors will stop at nothing to kill the innocents and win the round. One might be walking with it's friend, looking for the traitors, when BAM, you're killed by your friend, who just happens to be the traitor. No two rounds of TTT are never the same, with different people being traitors and different ways of ending up dead. TTT is just one of the many different gamemodes of Garry's Mod. There are so many gamemodes out there that this review would be too long for people to read. I haven't experienced even near close to the full amount of randomness that Garry's Mod has to offer. Which is why I fully recommend this game.
BUJANGINAM;-;this game is pretty fun :v
RUFFMIN;-;Bought game, joined a multiplayer server and got cyberbullied till i cried 11/10 its ok.
Prostaskius;-;I love this game and the many different aspects to which it entails. Keep growing!
SpaceCoon!;-;1) No one knows how to role-play ex. how is it going. someone:*shoot you in the face*. 2) Why is thier no sex rp? Sandbox+Sex=cash. so for anyone look to get cash into your paypal make a sex-rp server. My even going to help by giving you names G-, Thirteen life or Garry's  pounders 13. now you may be asking were does the cash come from well... models like a anthropomorphic animal (to get the yiff fans like myself),all MLP characters and Vocaloid characters (also put holo the wise wolf for me :).) If you make them pay $1 for each character you make and have like 50peps thats like  of cash. The only peps who are going to join this are people who want to do this , thus less trolls. 3) Do not buy this game for the Single player.
TehNinjaAssassin(GRgs);-;THIS GAME IS SO FREAKING AWESOME YOU MUST DOWNLOAD IT NOW!!!!!
Fishenkko;-;A great game with a lot of game modes ranging from Sandbox, Trouble In Terrorist Town (TTT), Prop Hunt and many more !!! Sandbox is mainly where one uses creativity to build and goof around for entertainment. TTT is where one uses deception and detective skills to win the game. Then there's Prop Hunt where the Hunters must find and eliminate the Props who are hiding, taking Hide and Seek to the next level. And so much more game modes to explore! This game is better off with a friend or two to witness all your funny moments. This game will certainly make you spend hours of gameplay and not get bored of it.
Caio Varalta;-;Garry's Mod + Friends = Endless Entertainment! Garry's Mod + Friends = Endless Fun! 10/10 - by far the best game I have on Steam
PandaDeeBear;-;this game is the best game ever you have different things to do in this game itslike games in a game
Sikh;-;jerked off to the workshop 69/10
Intant;-;Garry's Mod is a fun sandbox game which is possible to mod to pretty much what you want. Beside modding you could build whatever you want, if it is an airship or a house you could do it. I will rate this game 98 mods/ 100 mods.
[TBH] Skippy the Wonder Negro;-;my jimmies were once rustled. but when i played this i knew that i was at peace with myself and my jimmies
TacticalBaconz;-;Wasted my bandwidth on addons 10/10
Tiki;-;This is honestly one of the greatest games of all time and is on my list of top 5 easy. I can't believe that there are people out there that do not still have this game and it is truly one of the greats.
froggle22 :);-;Come on, how can you not like this game, if you somehow never heard of it, then hopefully this will persuade you to consider getting it. In short you can do practically anything. Roleplay, building, murduring your friends with guns. Also, say you don't want to go to a pre-built world, you want to make things your way, you can go to multiple different sandboxes to do lots of things. Drive cars, kill NPC's from multiple games such as half-life and team fortress 2 or build your own city. AND don't forget the workshop where you can get even more weapons, props, NPC's (such as hitler and master cheif) vehicles, or basically anything you can think of. I highly recommend this game for if you are ever bored or just looking to have fun doing anything you want, this game is for you.
FriendliestHeavy;-;Got chair violated by a ragdoll. 10/10
Strekki @allied-gamers.com;-;I can RDM on TTT and get banned constantly by 11 year olds. Great game, 10/10!
Cpr~FYANB~;-;Well here's a game that takes little to no skill to play and is fun for you and all your friends, with several different gamemodes it suits all different people, like from DarkRP to Deathrun the game suits all gametypes.
MountianDew;-;This game Is one of the Bests from exprience lol 410 hrs played i can say that it is whanna of the best sandbox games ever created. statement closed lol the amount of nineys and 12ies play this its funny

Dr.Pacman;-;I played it a little bit and I guess its ok.
Commander Babby;-;Never played that game, but it's probably a 10/10.
Artorias;-;Who needs a review for garrys mod? I mean, it's freaking garrys mod! Flying rocket sofa, weird animation faces, npc scenes in akward positions, blowing up things with bombs, dubstep shotguns and even a pe-nis rocket. Also, it's a good and simple tool for more some animation, like a funny shortmovie. "But those things will get monotonous for me one day, right?" BEEH. Wrong. Even if you get tired of these weird and random things (which is nearly impossible, specially if you play with friends) there are many other possibilities. You can download other game mods from the workshop for FREE (Yes, no DLC ). Hide 'n seek, zombie survival, race modes, golf, murder simulator 2015 and a much more!. And, if you have CS Source mounted, you will be able to play my favourite game mod - Trouble in Terrorist Town. The idea is pretty simple. The map starts, all players are terrorists. Among them, few people get to be "traitors", and few get to be "detectives". The traitors must kill everyone else, and the detectives have special tools to help in the investigation. Nothing satisfies more than pulling the trigger in a group of people saying "I'm not the traitor". Chaos is released and people start random shooting without even knowing the reason. Also, when you are a traitor you can buy your special equipment as well - Jihad bomb, knife stealth kill, get rekt gravity cannon and much more! In gmod not even the sky is meant to be a limit. Do what you want, the way you want, Anyway, ignore my poor english and buy this game NOW. 10/10, totally recommend it
Jo Con;-;You can do a whole lot of  in this ing game.
Altair 47;-;It's Garry's Mod. Need I say more?
sCH QunhTrm's BBAlen;-;destroyed a building with a potato 69/10 gee gee no re
Sergeant Rectal Ham;-;For those of you who are looking for an excuse to buy this game, look no more. Garry's Mod (or GMod, as the 'cool' kids call it) is a game where you can do ANYTHING. No, I'm not exaggerating, you can literally do ANYTHING ANYWHERE. Do you want to fight an endless hoard of zombies inside of the Krusty Krab? Do you want to destroy an evil race of Teletubbies overtaking McDonalds? Do just want to simply build a flying couch to get to the Cheese Planet? Well, you can do all this and more, with a few downloads from the EXTENSIVE Garry's Mod Steam Workshop! Just simply browse over the mod you want inside of the Workshop, and click "subscribe" and WHAM-OH! You got your self a satisfying new addition to your game. Easy. right? Yeah, yeah, I know. WARNING: Garry's Mod's Mods get SUPER addicting. At one point, I found myself with a grand total of over 500 mods, and I still wanted more! The only flaw with this game, however, is that some of the Workshop Mods require you to download other games before they can be usable, such as Counter Strike: Source, and the Half-Life 2 Episodes. So, it is EXTREAMLY RECOMMENDED that you buy the Counter Strike: Source/GMod bundle, because most of the fun Workshop Mods require Counter Strike: Source. So now that you read this review, go buy the game. It's REALLY cheap, for how much fun memories comes out of this game. So come on, download it now! Now! Noooowww! DO EEIT NOIWWW!!!! Still not satisfied yet, eh? Just search up "Seananners GMod" or "Venturian GMod" on YouTube for some great Garry's Mod let's plays. If your reading this part, that means your stupid and your still hesitating to buy the game. Trust me, you want this sexy game.
tech suport;-;This game is BY FAR the GREATEST and will always be the GREATEST (and I mean GREATEST) game in my Steam Library of 72 Games. With tons of mods, multiplayer content, and fun, I will never get tired of playing my favourite types of multiplayer games such as Trouble in Terrorist Town, which is alot like clue, DarkRP, well it's roleplay, that's all to say, Sandbox, good old screw around with few rules, Zombie Survival, survive hordes of player-controlled zombies or try to take out humanities last hope. Even in single player the fun continues! This is a great game to play with friends. Also, watermelons. 10/10!
Dad from South Africa;-;This game has a variety of multiplayer gamemodes with amazing mods! Have had hours of fun.

CanOfCatfood;-;Get this game if you have 50 Gb to spare (Thats for the addons only) but the game when you download is pretty small. I reccomend this game to people that ARE NOT TWELVE! (To much Twelvies) Follow me on twiiter: @CanOfCatfood
NoVoiceChanger;-;its gmod. stop being a little  and get it already. I'm just kidding. but in all seriousness. you can't go wrong with this game. there is anything and everything to do on it. and its absolutely fun to join RP (roleplaying) servers. only 4,000 people think this game is bad. and they don't even have valid reasons. Just take this for example. What other game can make you overwhelmed with joy by surviving the zombie apocalypse and making forts throughout the map with your friends and raiding other people for their money and supplies. UNDER $10!!?? Answer. Only Gmod. And keep in mind... that was only ONE gamemode. out of the thousands you could do. So grab your parents wallet. grab the credit card. spend $10. and blame me for making you buy it with all my decent reasons. Hope you guys enjoy, and see you on Gmod.
Tayatashi;-;Great game where everybody will find something for himself. Variety of gamemods, maps and whatever customisable things. Great game to play with friend or just to find a new ones :) The one 'bad' thing about it is that you need CS:Source to play the game without errors in textures.
BigBarbara;-;more than ing her right in the

Lt. Col. Robert [3rd CB];-;Garry's Mod is a good game. If you are looking for a reason to not get it you will not find one. It is good because this game is my first game when i went over 100 hours. Now I sit in the corner and wait for magical Chris Christie to help my obese ways become more skilled in the art fat***ness. Dis game iz teh good stuffz.
RED;-;Well, Were to start? Garry's Mod has come a long way, and may i say it is one of My Personal Favorite Game to play. I Grew up watching videos about Gmod and now that im actually apart of the awesomeness i recommend you get it and become a part of an Awesome Community!
CHEESEBURGAH;-;Garry's Mod orginated as a popular among fans sandbox game for the alraedy popular Half-Life 2, When it was released as a standalone game it was amazing.. It's a amazing sandbox game made in the 'Source Engine'. The limits to what you can make or do is the invisible wall infront of you, you can create giant walking dong monsters, Epic rollercoasters, amazing artwork.. you can play fanmade gamemodes like prophunt and hide from those combine soldiers as a Traffic cone in a grocery store, you can have full-scale battles with Non-Playable characters and much more. It is truly a great game and a MUST for those creative sandbox lovers out there. It also has user-created 'Addons' which are modifcations to the game which make the experience x1000 better with hoverboards, lightsabers, Nyan cat guns, chair launchers and lemon grenades. But.. Their is also the ugly in the form of the flood of downloads when playing Multiplayer, Kid admins everywhere, crappy DarkRP servers and effortless dupes.. also ever since FNaF struck their has been so many ing FNaF addons and dupes you could shove them all in a alternate universe and still have some to spare. Overall it's a great game with an "OK" community. I rate 89/100 RIP Kitty0706 artworks.
Sir Laizel;-;Great game. A lot of addons, i should say, its more like bundle of games then just one.

<Tsume>;-;I have played hours upon hours of this game. I cannot begin to tell you how much I have gotten out of Garry's Mod. Just everything about the game is perfect. The physics, gameplay, and community make it a great game to play and own. I really love how this game has a little bit of everything. From RP to TTT, it never fails to please.
{OSR}RobotMinion;-;dis game is life
Angrypielover;-;Amazing love the gameonly wish you didn't have to buy Counter-Strike-Source but I did still awesome game!!!!
MeatBall;-;I've been playing this game for a little while. You can meet nice peolpe and make good friends, but you can also accidentally go to a canerous server. Be wary when choosing a server my friend.
MaciKeks #HitmanHype;-;I lost my life to this.
TheRemarkableWolf;-;LIKE A BOSS this is a great game its sandbox roleplay driving all in 1 you need to get counter strike source to see the textures but its worth it ! GET IT ITS AWESOME
AvoxJake;-;I feel like Garry's Mod doesn't need a review. We all have this game and we all enjoy it!
Artorias;-;Who needs a review for garrys mod? I mean, it's freaking garrys mod! Flying rocket sofa, weird animation faces, npc scenes in akward positions, blowing up things with bombs, dubstep shotguns and even a pe-nis rocket. Also, it's a good and simple tool for more some animation, like a funny shortmovie. "But those things will get monotonous for me one day, right?" BEEH. Wrong. Even if you get tired of these weird and random things (which is nearly impossible, specially if you play with friends) there are many other possibilities. You can download other game mods from the workshop for FREE (Yes, no DLC ). Hide 'n seek, zombie survival, race modes, golf, murder simulator 2015 and a much more!. And, if you have CS Source mounted, you will be able to play my favourite game mod - Trouble in Terrorist Town. The idea is pretty simple. The map starts, all players are terrorists. Among them, few people get to be "traitors", and few get to be "detectives". The traitors must kill everyone else, and the detectives have special tools to help in the investigation. Nothing satisfies more than pulling the trigger in a group of people saying "I'm not the traitor". Chaos is released and people start random shooting without even knowing the reason. Also, when you are a traitor you can buy your special equipment as well - Jihad bomb, knife stealth kill, get rekt gravity cannon and much more! In gmod not even the sky is meant to be a limit. Do what you want, the way you want, Anyway, ignore my poor english and buy this game NOW. 10/10, totally recommend it
Mrdude;-;Great game, buy it for your kids so they can watch adulterated films with their friends :)
Kapper Johnson;-;Misread title, thought was Garry's Mom. Best mistake I ever did.

InfinityWizard;-;Garry's Mod is a fun "Sandbox-Or-Not" game. You can basically do whatever, such as playing various gamemodes or just messing around in the do-whatever sandbox. This game is a need-to-have.
-=Relic=-;-;Extreamly fun and an excusable time sink. There are many of its multiplayer moments that make it less than enjoyable... But I still believe it's the best sandbox game... that and it encourages drunk gaming/coding.
FluffyGoat;-;Great game for people who have nothing to do with their life and want to waste it away on a game.
Charmander;-;An amazing game. Weither you like TTT or just plain building things this game is great for valve fans.
Hyze;-;Garry's Mod, an amazing game with endless hours of fun Garry's Mod is a game where you can create mods, start servers, build elaborate machines of destruction or build something absolutely crazy, and that's the pure fun of Garry's Mod. The game has a great Multiplayer. Whether you experimenting with a friend or playing on a large server with other players, you will always find something to entertain you and provide many hours of enjoyment. The thing I love about Garry's mod is that there is an infinite amount of possibilities. You can never run out of things to do, you can pretty much think of anything, create it and then mould it into your personal masterpiece Garry's Mod - A Flatout Fun Game 8.2/10
Senip;-;Garrys Mod, Even though it's quite old. It's by far my favorite game of all time. It's multi variant game modes make it quite a blast and having the community be able to make a sever is great! I highley recommend Garrys mod to anyone.

Wobuffet3;-;everything is broken and it just plain sucks now. rip gmod
Skippieh;-;Garry's Mod is the craziest stuff you can get from Valve . Just try to think : What game allows you to create rideable toilet that can even fly and kill zombies or other players ? What game developer can say that they created game,that has another games inside ? You can play Sandbox,Troubles in Terrorist Town,Pirate Ship Wars,Base Wars and many others ! Even better thing is,when you can enjoy Garry's Mod with your friends.You can create your stuff or share stuff,that other people created ! Not interested yet ? OK, let's mention some, but definetly not all things,that you can also do in Garry's Mod. You can fight with players or aggressive NPCs. Fight alone or with friends! Make your own server and enjoy online parties, pvp fights and more ! Create some crazy stuff,others will like it. Show your imagination to everyone. Surprise them with huge machines you made,forts,houses,TVs.. Secure your house with cameras,kill intruders. Garry's Mod is game with no limits. Tired of Alyx ? Shot her in her head with a rocket! Want to spawn almost everything from every game that Valve and other developers developed ? Garry's Mod is right choice .. What are you waiting for ? GO and GET IT ! *Fun guaranteed.
Hinth;-;It's not addictive.
Codex;-;Great game, great communities. Love it.
Gandalf the Gay;-;Well what can I say about this game? It's extremely cheap at just over five pounds and is often reduced down to 2 pounds in steam sales but even the default price is reasonable when you compare it to the price of most modern console games. Also, is a game that doesn't require a super beefy PC with an expensive graphics card or CPU to run at a decent framerate, I played most of my hours on it on my 6 year old Toshiba laptop (that's not even meant for gaming) and only recently upgraded to a gaming PC to play other games. It enables you to use maps, textures, weapons, characters and pretty much anything from other games compatible with it such as Left 4 Dead 2, Counter Strike:Source and other very popular games such as a Free to Play game called Team Fortress 2 (TF2). With this feature built into the game it enables you to explore maps create/ spawn NPC`s (Non playable characters), vehicles and pretty much anything else your head can think of. I have played Gmod for nearly 200 hours and I can definitely say that I would recommend this game to a friend as well as TF2, and as a matter of fact I ended up buying this game, because one of my friends suggested it to me to play.
Taconnator99;-;This game is fantastic, but kills brain cells. Just beware of the bugs that this game has, such as: Console bug; everytime you open console it may or may not crash! Yay!; Memory bug: If a major game function is stuck on a loop, it'll take a lot of RAM. No joke. In order to fix this, you must restart the game. Or let it crash. Next up, and finally this is the last of the major bugs, The physics bug: Source Engine never expect a game like this to be created, so you'll find lots of rather funny bugs, and lots that are simply useless and need to be fixed. Oh well, nothing will change the fact that Source Engine was horribly written, and given any chance, and programmer (including me), could fix it. It's not FUBAR, just really . But all in all, the game is fun, halarious, crazy, and time consuming. I'd recommend it to anyone. Just beware of the bugs I've mentioned, they are real and common. Yes, you will be  if you're hauling money in dark RP, and then you get this awesome idea to make binds for  and so on, so bam you go to open console and CRASH! Just don't break anyhting, you'll get use to it sooner or later. One more thing, this game does have great memory. If you load into a server more than once, each time you'll load faster. The first time you may have to download stuff, the next you'll have it, you may go from hours on the first load, to minutes on the next, to seconds after the 30th load in. It's always nice to know gmod has SOME level of niceness. Whatever, just get the damn game and enjoy it, you'll love it. Just keep your addons on the low, and it breaks often.
hengsty;-;addictive gamemodes and great gameplay, only issue is texture problems if you do not own other games
Grizzly Bear;-;Roleplayed as Hitler and paid hobos to have a massive orgy, then gassed them all. 10/10 would play again more than worth the $10
Derpy;-;It's a game for those who are creative and well if you're not creative you can play gamemodes like TTT, PropHunt, DarkRP, Murder.
RJ s;-;How not to crash: -After spawning, wait another 1 hour to make sure Garry's Mod has loaded everything. -Once you spot a lua error, you must freeze in place and make a few steps away from your PC. -After spawning an object via the spawn menu, you must wait 10 minutes. -If the game freezes, you must go to the church, pray for the jewish, give all your money to an elder and dance on top of a garbage truck, all within 10 minutes. -After installing an addon, you must restart Steam five times. -If you need to reload a weapon, don't. Just drop it on the floor and spawn another one. Doesn't matter that you had 33123213 more clips. -If the game, despite your best efforts, crashes, you must take your PC and sink it in holy water 5 times, then go to the cemetary, burrow it, put a black rose, a white rose, cabbage, a mushroom and the beard of a goat, in the same order. Leave it there 10 days and then go buy a new PC. 11/10 would go through all that again.

Daniel Blake;-;If you're into Minecraft and expect much more, then Garry's Mod is for you! It has alot more features and is kind of a step up. Garry's Mod has a ton of workshop items to play around with. Wether you like to make animations or just have fun, you can have addons galore with this game. I totally recomend it. Played Garry's Mod for 678 Hours, Totally worth it! 10/10 Would play again. 3/23/2015 Edit: Well this game is life, over 2000 hours now. Totally worth it.
Xerino;-;Pretty fun game! Many different gamemodes & Communities to play on. Some of the gamemodes over time however fall into disrepair and desolation. So pick wisely!
Baron Von Luftwaffle;-;This is a great sandbox, builder game. In multiplayer, there are loads of different and great gamemodes to play! This is a great game, I HIGHLY recommend this to any creative, and fun minds out there. I would love to buy it again. Except, I'm too poor :(
Sds;-;i made a rocket powered bathtub. it flew all around the map, then exploded on impact when it hit my friend. best game ever.

Anonymous Cat;-;very good sandbox game many workshop items so there will always be something to do
Bastion;-;Modding has never been so pain free and enjoyable. Gmod Provides regular players with the bare bone essentails to create brilliant feats of engineering and allows Advance players to create player models, maps and more and implement them into the game with ease. Running on the source engine, this game can easily handle many assets at one time including whatever specialties added like trails, Thrusters, ect and of course still has the brilliance of the physics engine that can lead to some very funny and unpredicable events. Gmod alone contains two gamemodes, the standard sandbox and the trouble in terrorist town gamemode (TTT) and once you get tired of those, you can easily find a million fan created game modes that are full of enjoyable people to play with, giving this game a extreme amount of replay value for the small price they ask for. Outside of fan modding, Gmod is fully able to literaly rip out the files from other source engine games that are on your hardrive and allows you to work with them instantly without and pain in the  proting files. But I really do recemend that you play mainly with mates or with a community you can visit regularly as a lot of the fun can come from this. Gmod is a very massive and growing game, with a very tiny pricetag. worth the purchase without a doubt.
8-Bit Scout;-;Garry's Mod is really cool. You can basically do whatever you want. :D
(MLG)KunningKing;-;I thought this game was pretty cool i dont really like it when it crashes and freezes on me tho other wise its a pretty cool game over all 9 out of 10
I Swear She Was 16;-;hello.MY name is Joe.I like this game.
BetleGeuce;-;This game is just excellent !! there's a lot of different gamemodes that give amazing gameplay. In addition, you can play with your friends, which is very amusing in laughs . Frankly , buy it , it 's worth 10$ for such a game, it's almost gave!!
Kythrol;-;Garry's Mod is a sandbox. An amazing sandbox, that is. You can spawn stuff and construct things, both simple and complex. You can spawn characters and shoot them in the face. You can construct a large flying table, spawn characters and smash them in the face using your large flying table. Or you could also play one of the many community-made mods, ranging from zombie killing to roleplay. It's hard not to enjoy this game.
BulDodge;-;made by Newman 11/10
ViDame;-;Like seriously........just ing buy it.
The Pro Hobo;-;The important question in any investment is "It it worth my time and hard earned money?" To answer this question, yes. Garry's Mod is unique in the sense that ALL servers on there are not Valves servers, they're completely community based! That means if you dispise one community of a certain gamemode, you just hop on a new server. Gamemodes? All community created! And there is a ton of them! Don't like one thing? Try another! Don't like that? Go into singleplayer! Getting lonely? Go onto multiplayer or create a server! Still hate this game? Well  you! It has a source engine which means console, and commands. "Well what does that mean?" That means that you can change any setting on the game! Of course there are boundaries on servers, but on singleplayer open the console and type "sv_cheats 1" and you have access to any command in game! And there are tons! Want to change the sensitivity of a zoom on a sniper rifle? You can! And in decimals! Want to change your fps or set its max for complete control of lag? Type "fps_max (number, normal is 300!) Even with these changes and on highest graphics, you will run the game with little to no lag, of course there are acceptions. (Spawning in items) I undoubtfully love this game! It has a quality no other game can compare! And it may say 'sandbox' but really it's everything! (expcept maybe mobas, heh someone make a server for that!) Want to be a dog wearing a baby with rockets for eyeballs? You absolutely can! Want to be a watermelon? Well, you can! Want to be Sonic? You can! Even if you get bored of Vanilla you can go onto the workshop and subscribe to stuff to put into your singleplayer. You can be any custom thing you can imagine. You can even create playermodels (Of course you need an external program, but you can!) Still don't think this game is good enough for you? Well sir, I bid you farewell, as you do not have reason not to. You're not good enough for this game! The end....
Binnsy;-;10/10 best watermelon smashing simulator out yet.
BRINX;-;This game is so awesome you can almost do whatever you want you can build lots of stuff, do some roleplaying games
Zodiac;-;Theres no easy way to put this, but to say it straight out, BUY IT!!! But be worn, your face will be glued to your screen when playing, with all the new gamemodes being implemented, and the new severs many fans are starting. I belive this is going to be a never dying game!

StarFireThe3rd;-;Garrys mod is a fun game but there is some problems with the game. First off all when your trying to download addons its just slow and glitchy. Then when you try to play the game after downloading the addon it like lags or glitches out completly and yes crashes. 2nd of all why do we need to get addons can't it be like when we first got it and its just in the q menu its so much easier. 3rd is that the admens in role play and stuff dont even do their job or get mad when someone actually puts them in jail because they broke a rule in role play. And i was watching this youtube video where there was a admin recording himself and he was just lazy. other wize this game is pretty good i guess. So i guess 6.3/10. What should i reveiw next? Maybe The Sims.
get good get lmaobox;-;Why don't you already own this game? EDIT: 5/4/15 I made this review a long time ago, in 2013 if I believe. A lot of people are giving this game bad reviews due to all the little kids and 'Five Nights At Freddys' mods. Yes, I do think that it's bad in those parts but this game shouldn't be not recommended due to the public server population. Singleplayer is fun but I think the game really shines when you play it with a close friend or two. Either you're laughing so hard you can't breathe or ragekilling your buddy for ing up your build. Pretty fun if you ask me.
Yukinon;-;Trouble in Terrorist Town     Garry's Mod!
Lady Cat;-;I lub Gmod. Gmod is love, Gmod is life. Seeing as I have 140 hours these past two weeks on Gmod, I'd say that it's a good -scratch that- great game to waste all your time on.

You can build all kinds of things ranging from flying cans to Giant Super Destruction Bears using the tools provided! Your imagination is the key to sandbox! On the other hand, there are a number of amazingly fun multiplayer servers with game modes like Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, and many more! Pick up this game while it's on sale, while it's on regular price or whatever works for you! The game is great fun and you will not get bored with it! And if you don't buy it....

SomeGuy;-;i was killed by a potato 10/10
Harry Potter;-;Garry's Mod is a fun and interesting game to play. I highly recommend all to play as you'll be addicted as I am.
Mercy, FemPyro;-;Garry's Mod is amazing. It's sort of the jack-of-all-trades; you can play the game in so many different ways, from posing to building to mods like Terrorist Town. I think this is the game that can offer people anything, a bit like Minecraft. But, you know, with more TF2.
Sneaky;-;Garrys Mod is one of the best sandbox games currently out on PC. There are no other games like it, once you start playing and find a game mode that you like then you will never stop playing. There are thousands of mods, maps and other general content available for Garrys Mod through the Steam workshop, this content can add thousands of hours worth of game play. Go play DarkRP.
Impulze;-;Garry's Mod is a Sandbox game based on Half life 2's source engine. The game's content is mostly player made, including the gamemodes you can play, the models, weapons, textures and other script-based entities written in Lua. Examples for popular gamemodes: 1. Sandbox Creatvity is the only limit here, build giant houses, warmashines, spaceships or even complexer stuff out of models and constraints and for the advanced builder out of simulated chips that allow you to create little programms. for example a flying spaceship, a minigame. 2. Trouble in Terorist Town The players are devided in two groups: the innocent and the traitors. the traitors have to silently murder the innocents, while the innocents have to follow clues they find on victims found by a detective with special tools like a dna scanner, which is a player aswell. It's like playing werewulf or cobs and robbers, just online and with more action. 3. Prophunt The players are in two groups: the props and the hunters. The props can turn into any prop they find and must hide in maps like cs_office or custom maps while the hunter searches for the prop and has to kill it to win. 4. DarkRP It's a roleplay gamemode for multiple players, where you can be a cop, citizen or even a major. Start a gundealer carreer if you like.
That One Arab;-;Great game, casual, relaxing and you meet heaps of friendly people. Loads of different game modes which means more fun right? I highly recommend it to everyone

Mask The Terrible;-;this game is as fun as you make it, only problem is ya need to buy some other games for it to work or you will get errors everywhere
Doctor Flubbers;-;Great Game. If you wanna play this game without any texture problems you also need Counter Strike: Source. (Half Life-2 for some cases too)
Dr.Shmoop;-;This game is very essential for your steam account really. It's more like the Milk to your Cereal, the Peanut Butter to your Jelly. This is a MOD-game, with limitless gamemodes, maps, addons and everything you could dream of, in a 10$ package. Play sandbox, spawn stuff. Play TTT, find out who traitors are and kill em, or join them. play gungame, every kill you earn a new gun. Play flood, build ships, destroy other ships, gain cash, buy weapons, repeat. And so on! This game well, theres no other way to say it, because you may have it already. This is a must in every steam account.

-{(::113300::)};-;This is fun and a great game,I remember the time that I played with friends in my server, with mods. But the time came to the end, when garry's mod, change to 13. It started to create more errors, More missing texture and every 20 minutes it crashs. "You want to create a server?" garrys mod 13 asked me, I said "yes, of course!" then garrys mod 13 said "THEN F*** YOUR SELF BECOUSE YOU CANT!". And the loooooooooooooong looading, I need to wait a HOUR, just to open the game. I prefer the old garrys mod not 13!!!
Aquilapath;-;Gmod is best played with friends, If you don't have a group of friends you may not enjoy it as much but it is still alot of fun.

CloseShave;-;Uh Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed Now to make it 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

The Lone Tader;-;Absolutely....amazing. There isn't a thing you CAN'T do in this game. Completely amazing, thank our lord and savior Garry.
Smigu;-;Okay.. name me ONE other game that can do half the crazy stuff this game can! Name me ONE! Name a game where you can take a Renamon, nail it to a barrel, turn the barrel into an improvised NASA reject, and launch it into the sky, and then make it explode with a gun from Half Life 2. You can't, can't you? Garry's Mod is ultimately 23,000 games in one, and all you need is a couple old Source games lying around on your hard drive. Simple, isn't it?
Fallen Samurai;-;This game have so many mods. I recommend this game!
Commander #ArabRP_Soon;-;It's A Very Very Very Good Game

jmoak3;-;Want infinite content where people will literally make you new gameplay in exchange for a 'like' on their profile? Do you want a new toy, that makes new toys every hour? Do you want a new game, that makes new games every hour? Or maybe you want a new movie maker to create your dream movie - GMod does all of these things. It's a physics sandbox that mounts content from most Source based games, in which all content is user created and shared. You can do anything you can think of.

Burguer_;-;When I bought Garry's Mod, I liked the game right from the first second, to see that the game led to do whatever we want, to see our own creativity to create whatever we want (it does not, but almost everything) and also to be multi-player and have several mod's, Like Hide and Seek, etc. ... In my opinion, Garry's Mod is worth buying because it is a game of pure creativity and fun. (You're welcome for the help)

Looking For A Golden Wrench :);-;This game is not an ordinary game. It's a collection of games, it can range from anywhere from a simple sandbox server to a fully custom MOBA game. Their are NO limits as to what can be made here. I would reccomend this to anyone, its a must have.
Mr.OldManBoot;-;Love this game. You can build anything you want to just put your mind into it.
XxLordNocoper420xX;-;LIKE THIS IF YOUR A MEME LORD M8

Morbid Fable;-;Greatest sandbox game known to man, it's a must buy. I got this game when I was in third grade and currently I'm in ninth. My friends showed it to me and I never quite understood it but the community is great, it's a community driven game. Without the community you're left with a blank slate. The game modes are abundant with players ranging in all ages and locations. So many game modes to choose from that every experience is different.
KAMAKAZI LIZARD;-;Got Killed by a watermelon 10/10
Xafron Chi;-;Lots of fun to be had in Garry's Mod. Play Sandbox and do random stuff like build things, kill people, play with mods and other people's creations, or play other gamemodes you can get through the game or Steamworkshop like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Melon Bomber, Prop Hunt, and loads more. You will need to get the right textures for a lot of this stuff though by buying and installing various Valve games. Overall, pretty fun. "Ain't nobody got time for that!" -a gun...
Kurt117;-;TTT: Great mod,fun to play but only if you join a decent server or play with some friends Prop Hunt: used to spend most of my free time playing this,because i found a great community (techsource) and it was so fun playing with them Darkrp: SO MANY ING KIDS,still a great mod though Sandbox: i'm so bad at this,like i can't build ............. other mods:you have to try them yourself,but first fin some friends or a good community. my point is,this is a great game (or a mod,whatever) but it's all about the community,if you just join some  random servers you'll probably end up deleting the game after a few hours but if you join the right servers you'll end up playing the game on a daily basis :D
doge;-;So you f*cked up and made a game while drunk, how do you fix that? YOU DON"T. You accept the fact that you accidentaly made the best game ever made.
One Fine Gentleman;-;Garry's mod is one of those Rare games that you can play again and again and never really bore of. You can find other games, and invest hundreds of hours into them, but at the end of the month, you find yourself wishing you could just play some more Garry's Mod. I don't have over 450 hours into it for nothing, and, compared to some of the people I've met and talked to over the internet, that's not even that much to invest into a single game. It's setup into different gamemodes. There's classic sandbox, where you can build and screw around on any amount of maps, with NPC's and other Mechanics. There's Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), where a few people are randomly selected as 'traitors', and try to kill the other players on the server, while 'innocents' and 'detectives' are trying to figure out who the Traitors are. I owned a Server for TTT, and I have to admit most of my hours are into asmuch. A few things to note; First off, it's not the most well-optimized game out there. I have quite an expensive computer, but it still takes forever to load into the game, and will crash periodically, for no reason. I used to play on a DarkRP server (another gamemode) called Serious Roleplaying Hell, or SRH for short, and while that thing had a "hell" of a lot of "serious" items for "roleplaying" (I am so sorry), the game lagged the devil out of itself, while a lot of games would be able to handle something like that without too-much-trouble. Another thing to keep in mind is that it has Workshop support. Maps, NPC's, Models, Ragdolls, Machines, Weapons, and loads of other Misc. Content fills Garry's Mod, and has been on the second page of Workshop contributators for a while, if not the first one. Overall, between the content, the Price (especially 2+ years later, when the price has dropped $10), all the dfferent gamemodes (Besides Sandbox, TTT, and DarkRP, there is also Prophunt, Murder, a DayZ Spinoff, and countless others), it's a great game that's totally worth it. Cheers!
Xena's acc ;^);-;Look at me Look at your hours at garrys mod now look at mine Is this game worth five thousand hours of your life? Well, if we convert 5,866 hours into days. I wasted 245 days of my life on this game. Now is it worth it? Minging, trolling, killing, being stupid. Yes it is. Now, be like me and waste your life away.
Mini Dew;-;Yup Need I go on?
RGJ_ScrubLord;-;If this game was a Potato it would be a slightly better Potato then those rip off Potatos. To sum it all up this game was a good carrot.

Cody Izzo;-;Garry's Mod (GM) is a virtual world developed by Linden Lab launched on June 23, 2003, and is accessible on the Internet. A free client program called the Viewer enables its users, called Residents, to interact with each other through avatars. Residents can explore, meet other residents, socialize, participate in individual and group activities, and create and trade virtual property and services with one another, or travel throughout the world (which residents refer to as "the grid"). Garry's Mod is for people aged 16 and over.

Richard Longflop;-;It's ok
Ju-Liar Gillard;-;"Garrys mod" is a hands down great game in Many unusual ways. it consists of many models and characters from your Beloved games for you to test with. Its amazing how steam games you buy and download, will be stored in the game files for you to play around with. It Includes Workshop which gives you the ability to download mods, Tweaks And just anything that can possibly Amuse the human brain, making servers are great and easy to host, When hosting a server all your mods will be plugged into the server so you and your friends can have a great modded server to play on, There are also many other game modes such as "Gmod Zombies","DarkRp","Sandbox" and many others too. Theres awesome ideas, so why not bring it to the virtual camera! Thats right, you can record from only a click of your mouse in game, so you can bring all your wild fantasys to life! Its runs very well on all Personal Computers, Laptops And Desktops, My Team Tested a 2001 windows xp model and it runs at 30 fps on medium settings, which is great for all you gamers out there who want to play a great game for a small amount of coin. And not to mention it has a great community that welcomes all ages to play! There are no limits to what you can do, i highly recommend this game to all users, with only a small price to pay Of $10.00
hair trigger dick nigqer;-;garry is a ing  coder, for every bug he fixes he creates 5 more gmod13 is the worst thing since they turned cs go into call of duty tf2 edition the only good thing in gmod13 was the workshop, but even that is  because he got rid of all the actually good  in the toybox, and replaced it with some  thing where 12 year olds upload " ALYX HARD IN BOOTY WTAHC GMAN MAKE HIS PELVIX MOVES" seriously thats the entire front page don't even get me started on nude model dupes "HEY GUYS HERES THIS NEKED ZERO SOT SAMUS BUT NEED TH NEKED ZERO SOT SAMUS MODEL FROM GARYSMODE. U NO ITS JUST THE MODLE BUT THIS WAY U CAN SPAWN WITH DUPE INSTED OF JUST USING Q MENU" also the ing minecraft dupes god damnit seriously if you want a ing box man then go stick your dog in a tv for s sake and for the pickaxe just use a real one, then you can pvp irl with your  friends and natural selection will take it's course and the rainbow box dupes too, seriously its just a gay pride flag with the same color trails that just explode ALSO OMG GUIS 40K IN DARKRP MONEI!?!?!? But even with all this cluster of faggy , it's still a playable game. TL;DR: Workshop is filled with  dupes and Gmod13 is .
Mammo7h;-;This game is the best game because it is whatever you want it to be. You can drive a car with a thruster off a ramp and see how much air you get, or make two ragdolls kiss, or design a giant stompy robot, or even just shoot at things. Its because of this flexibility that Garrys Mod continues to entertain me while other games on my account are left gathering dust. In the perspective of price to time played this game has been a better value than anything else on Steam.
Wotm8;-;I only play it once in a while, it's okay I guess.

Slinky48;-;I don't really enjoy this game. Going through the trouble to find a decent map and waiting for things to download is so time consuming. I just bought it and played it for 3 hours. I did find some games to play but, I didn't enjoy them due to the fact that there was no leading way to complete a mission. Most because you need to download a bunch of "God Knows" to play and then most of the textures aren't there and all I see is Error signs and purple checkered textures fills everywhere. I wish I didn't buy this game and kept my 10 dollars. I wouldn't have even paid 1 dollar if I knew it was like this.
SMELLZ;-;im very mad now every time i launch the game it turns off :( i really want my money back please help because i cant even start the game. can i get my money back please :(

Pikachu;-;You won't enjoy the game if you're a furry. http://puu.sh/hDGKR/af99dd69ea.png Look like this group like to make fun and harass anyone that's a furry. A friend that's into it found a post that my profile were featured in a thread that was "Find the worst Steam Profile ever". To be honest I find it offensive, even when I wasn't into the forum. I've registered and leaved a reply defending myself, and look what I got after 2 days. I admit something, the game is a blast, but their community, is not. Just nice.
Gamecool 10;-;What is Garry's Mod? Garry's Mod is a hard thing to describe. You could say it's another community-made mod to Source that was approved by Valve, or you could say it's a pure incarnation of the Internet and all it's current shenanigans. Whichever works. Start up the game and you'll immediately notice a lot (and I mean a LOT ) of pink and black squares. This is the placeholder texture for all missing textures you don't have. To fix this, either buy the game Counter-Strike: Source or download it's textures (Which are completely free and legal to obtain, just make sure you get them from a trusted website.) On to the actual review. Garry's Mod is anything you can build and everything you can imagine. it is the ultimate sandbox experience. You can create contraptions and test them out in Singleplayer, or have the most fun you can have online (TF2 reference :P) and play around with your buddies. Don't have buddies? Garry's Mod has those too. There are loads of gamemodes to choose from. TTT, PropHunt, and DarkRP being the most popular. You can even make them yourself. Want to make a My Little Pony Roleplay gamemode? do it . Want to create your own community addicted to cars? do it Want to invite some friends to a server and eat some virtual cake? Do. It. You really can't cram what Garry's Mod is into one review. but to basically sum it up... You can eat balls to gain health. 10/10
Bikonito;-;yeah it's ok
MtDewOC;-;I never thought I would like to play this as a primary game, but after playing a little bit I realised it is far more than just a building game, that people make ragdolls go crazy or twist their faces around. I host a "Trouble in Terrorist Town" server on Garry's Mod and I love it! The game starts up and it randomly selects 25% of the players to become traitors, and their mission is to kill the innocent players. It keeps you on edge and forces you to logically deduce who the traitors are and who you need to kill in order to survive. There are also Role Playing gamemodes that you can drive a car around and live a crazy life. Garry's Mod has the potential to play anything: BHop, TTT, RolPlaying, Prophunt, Jailbreak. Basically anything that people can think up. It is an extremely moddable game.
ViciouS;-;i love this game :)
Jelour;-;Fairy's Mod, The Unrelenting Force of bugs. This game has alot of bugs and lags on Online servers, which I hate.. I will put GOOD Points and BAD about this. Good: -Classic Graphics -Alot of Addons and things to do -Interesting Items -Nice movement [easy] -Okay Controls -Nice Ragdolls -Nice Mods [Prop hunt, cinema...] Bad: -Glitchy -Laggy -Glitchy Multiplayer -Buggy Multiplayer -Servers take forever to load -When first time joining the game, if you have 30+ addons/mods, It will take you 1h to install all them so you can use them. -Only 2 default maps -No legs [Lol] -Buggy Ragdolls [sometimes] -Some Controls not working -Sometimes items' menu not showing up As you can see, there is much more Bad things about this game, but still, I recommend this, since I have 40+ hours on this, Have fun! :)) Rate: 10/10 EDIT: Now i got 130+ hours on this, it is amazing, im experiencing less LAGS, AND BUGS, So just get this game, no regrets at all! :D My Rate right now: 12/10
OG Dreamcast;-;This game is really bad, like really really bad, you don't do anything. It's so nothing. Why do I spend time with it? Cause I can quickscope thats why. 11/10 one of the best/worst games ever made.
CaptainMax;-;Garry's Mod is an awesome game with awesome gamemodes and i love it because it is a sandbox game xD
Foe;-;A fun tool if you're bored, but not much fun outside of screwing around with friends.
T.A.R.S.;-;U can play many games... in one game
Good Health;-;what the
Liam Neeson Punching Wolves;-;Pay for mods, for a mod. My brain.
Dr. Fluttershy;-;EDIT: I'm still going to keep this here. So paid mods have been removed -for now- HOWEVER if they return in the future I have no doubt Garry will attempt to have them added to here, so I am going to caution people against that. Also the community here is one of the most obnoxious I've ever seen in the gaming community so don't expect much out of that either. --V Original Review V-- Looks to be heading in the Paid Mods direction of which I want no part of, mods MAKE this game. Typical of that scumbag Garry to try capitalize on this too, avoid the publisher Facepunch at all costs. I somehow doubt his cute little company would survive the backlash if this happens, unlike Bethesda this isn't a massive 'AAA' title company.
Zenophilious;-;Gary voiced his support of paid mods, and openly insulted the modding community on his twitter account, apparently missing the irony completely. Don't buy this game, you'll just be giving money to an incredibly selfish, callous person.
AintSkeered;-;I used to really enjoy this game, but many things have ruined the experience First of all, the community is absolute CANCER. You got 9-12 year old vanoss fanboys on every damn server with their edginess and high pitched voice annoying the hell out of you. Last time I played it was flooded with FNAF bull sh!t in workshop and dupes, which makes this game like a huge f*cking DLC for FNAF. Secondly, this game is going to support paid mods in the future, which is going to ruin this game and just kill it because servers will turn into pay to get in sort of thing. It's really only enjoyable with friends and easy game to troll people on, but other than that it's full of cancer. EDIT: Garry is also a d!ck as you see he calls the steam community c*nts https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/591667165335560193
TITOMOSQUITO187;-;Meh..best marketed thing on Steam. Gotta hand it to the developers though. Making millions off the Steam Workshop and Valve for their marketing prowess with this game. If you don't feel like reading a bunch of BS about how to use this MOD, then don't bother buying it. You're just  away money on something you don't understand, and didn't look into before you bought it. Don't buy it just becaue EVERYONE else owns it. They only own it because Valve has marketed the ever loving s*** out of it and everyone just bought it at some point because you can't go anywhere without seeing it on sale. Don't forget to buy the other 15 gmaes you need to play most of the crap on here to sling racist terms around with 12 year olds and throw turds around. :)
Matt Marche;-;While this is clearly an enjoyable game, evident of my 4000 hours, I won't recommend it for many reasons. If you find something you really like here, it will be very easy to get lost in it and spent countless hours on it, even if you're not doing anything new. That's how garry's mod is. If you don't have enough free time for this game it can be seriously detrimental to your personal and professional life. The community in this game is excellent and terrible. There are some fantastic people on this game, but there are plenty of stupid children and teenagers as well. If you can take the bad people in stride, you will like the community. The variety in this game is incredible, no need to comment on that. If you're willing to explore some gamemodes you will probably find something fun for yourself. However I would not recommend picking this game up unless you know for a fact you won't get addicted to it or you have very good self restraint. Because of the majority of people fall into those categories I'm going to put "Not Recommended".
Maximumbeef;-;Paid mods ruin the community, i won't support any game / developer that introduces them.
Magic Mike XXL;-;Gave me cancer after a day of playing. The amount of trolls is too much for me to handle.
BITT3R_G4M3R;-;Garry Newman is anti-consumer, greedy, insults modders/fans & personally for me Garry's Mod is overrated find a better game to play http://garry.tv/2015/04/24/paying-for-mods/ http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/33tqr5/according_to_garry_newman_most_of_the_modding/ http://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/discussions/1/618460171322754966/ EDIT: Valve got rid of the paid mods but don't forget & don't forgive the people supporting this choice they aren't for the consumer http://steamcommunity.com/games/SteamWorkshop/announcements/detail/208632365253244218
Gorin Endhelm;-;It's pretty cool with friends, and for trolling little baby people who have no self estem and need their mothers to wipe their tushies. You can do stuff, and hear annoying teenage admins kick, ban, and gag people for having fun because their parents don't love them and the get bullied at school this the one slice of their peace they can have so they are complete JERKS to everyone who wants to share it with them. 9.5/10 it's ok
Dragnort;-;Multiple ways of playing this game you can: Build a huge tower with watermelons, play TTT with some friends, play Prop Hunt (One of the best gamemodes for fun in my opinion), and other multiple gamemodes. Garrys mod or Gmod for short opens up a new perspective for gamers who just want to have fun creating crazy new things from Catapaults or Nyan cat Launchers. However you always get that pesky little bugger who always tries to wreck the fun.
hyperbola;-;great for RDMing. 10/10
EvO;-;This game is so awesome. Unlimited possibilities. If you are a sandbox fan you must buy this. Playing with friends is fun or you can play on a server (if you want one join me and my friend's server 23.88.247.249:27016). This game is full of destruction, balloons, dead stuff, guns, bombs and lots n' lots of stuff you can download from the workshop. (gotta try the nuke addon, just don't do it on a server or you will end up getting banned from there lol). If you find it expensive you can wait for the sale and it will be at 2$-ish. TL;DR Good game 9/10
Orangy57;-;I'm a can of soda hiding in a corner.
-- hadowrazHD;-;Garry's Mod has 9 letters, 9 is divisible by 3, 9/3= 3x1= 3 Half Life 3 Confirmed.
[BA] Baron von Haxor;-;This is one of my favourite games out there. I've always like garry's mod because facepunch studios made the game in such a way so it would be very easy for people to mod and create addons for. The community are constantly creating addons for this game so it's hard to become bored. I've always said that garry's mod is really good because its the kind of game that you could re-create any other game in with some time and effort. I would reccomend that people buy this because of the low price and the hours of fun that can be had.
DoubtfulHen754;-;gr8 b8 m8 cant even h8 so I r8 8 outta 8
Brincksmadness;-;you shouldnt just make it so you have to buy a game so yo dont have errors and pink stuff

Ser Doge;-;spawned 300 bridges on a russian server and it crashed 10/10
Tavi :3 | trade.tf;-;Just awesome sauce...Just...I dont know
FrenZyyy;-;One of the best games I've ever played, The workshop makes it unlimited world!
DoW|The Old Doctor;-;You can make anything funny and random 10/10
Solar;-;If you are looking for a game to play with friends, Garrys Mod has tons of fun game options for you to play with your best friends cx Although I also do recommend getting counter strike source (CSS) for the textures, or else some textures will be pink and black and some items will be giant error signs. Otherwise great game :3
theironpaw;-;If you don't like sandbox, why not try the hundreds of countless mods that are made for Garys Mod made by the community. Guarantee you will find some sort of enjoyment amongst the hordes of screaming children.
GaruuuS ^.^;-;Super fun game to play, especially if you play it with your friends. Ruined my life, 5 Stars.
WaxyPenguinAnal;-;i like it it gud it coo pla on GFL server for ttt thats not product placment 10/10
Pooh Bear;-;I love this game :3
Christopher Walken is Jesus;-;-Goes on DarkRP server -Becomes gun dealer -Buys gun shipment -Pockets it -RDM's everybody on the server -Gets kicked by  admin who does not know how to ban -Comes on again and rdms -Keep's getting kicked after rdming and not banned 10/10 would rdm dumb admins again.
Tundra2;-;Honestly in my opinion this is probaly the most fun steam game available. Over 700+ hours dont lie when I say this game is amazing! From sandbox wars to darkrp prop fights you will have loads of fun!
d_reno;-;Very good game. Lots of hours to spend/waste your time on. Gmod is a very good sandbox for creative minds, you can create A LOT of things, and I mean A LOT. Then there's the multiplayer, heaps of hours to have fun online with TTT and many other gamemodes 10/10
NotRated_PG;-;It's Just Great,
Lunchbox;-;Went onto a darkrp server, assassinated the admin/Mayor got kicked. 420/69 would kill admin/mayor again.
Meow Cat Meow;-;Gmod is the best! From the Guns to Npc's, to the Multiplayer to the Props. You could make just about anything!
Racist-lan;-;Before I played this videogame, I misunderstood the joys of having a watermelon stalk my every movement
Commodore Manzaza;-;Have seen alotta videos made out of it, which had those 'body language' comedy, which made me laugh so hard call me Al, Dente. Easier to use, you could put tons of facial expressions to models. I'd say this is one hella application for fun. If you are troublesome, ask the doctor or a psychiatrist and they might recommend you to watch Gmod. About the game, it's really awesome. ''Modding at it's finest'' they said. Best modding game/tool, and awesome experiencing. I mean, everything is possible in many ways. Everything is permitted! -Hassan I Sabbah :D 9.3/10
Professor Spike;-;Basically the Internet in game form.
xTcR | Hoodini [TF-L2];-;My second fav game on steam. :) I like all the game styles like TTT and murder. I know some people hate it but everyone has there own opinion. EVEN THOSE YOU ARE ING WRONG! No jk don't hurt me.
Activatorz;-;This game is great. There is a variety of game modes to choose from. Whether you're alone or with friends, the fun never ends!
yardybear;-;This game is good for pep's of all ages u can play with friend or if you dont have any you can play all by your self.
onodera;-;great game if you're autistic
Roland;-;Blew my self up with a wooden box 10/10
David Spade;-;Best game I ever played ;)
:;-;Brutally murdered my friend with a bathtub, 100/10
JoBro_Momo_Blue;-;This game is my favorite Steam game so far. It's a Half-Life 2 mod. You can play Sandbox mode, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Murder, Deathrun, DayZ, and much, much, much more. All modes available in singleplayer, but only sandbox mode makes sense to play on single player.It does have blood, but not too much. In Sandbox mode, you can spawn nearly ANYTHING! Soda machines, cars, people, weapons, cans, boxes, and much, much, much, much, much more. You can even download EVEN MORE stuff to mess around with! Worth twice its cost!
Jvs;-;Source Engine breaker simulator. If you ever wanted to pose gman and alyx having sexual intercourses in HL2, you can do it in GMod ( that's how the game even started to be developed as in the first place ). The modding is quite extensive, you can create new maps, gamemodes, entities, weapons from scratch to create anything you want, soccer, deathmatch, roleplay and whatever. Or if you don't care about creating you can just go on the sandbox gamemode and build stuff like you want, and if you're lazy enough you can download trough the ( albeit a bit broken ) workshop. The sore spot of GMod is that two gamemodes are really popular ( DarkRP and TTT ) and they're overshadowing everything else, and people only care about those two and nothing else. This creates a closed loop where nothing new can go in due to the community ( and server browser too ). If you don't care about the stuff above and just want to play with your friends to screw with ragdolls from other games and do whatever you want in sandbox, this is the game for you. Just be wary of the community.
MrMimeGuy712;-;LOVE IT
CaptainBlueBalls;-;10/10 woud play 6/9 would bang 4/20 would smoke with 9/11 would blow
OwlsLover;-;Cant see to get off the game.. Thats how good it is c:
Comrade Kek;-;Most autistic fun you can have for 10 bucks.
HoTxMiX;-;Nothing to say actually... just PURE fun
Big Winky;-;This game is great banter, until i got permanetly banned by a death run server. luk if u cri evry tim
Lord Ghandi;-;One of the best games ive ever played in a long time. If you like building awesome or strange contraptions you can! It has other gamemodes such as prop hunt, TTT, Murder, and so much more. I have fun either playing by myself or with my friends.
MrBoomBacca;-;This is a really good game iv been playing it for 4 months and it hasnt gotten borring yet
Kbredeson [TC];-;Buy this game. I don't care what you say, buy it. Unless you are a minge.
ParadoxCataclysm;-;This game is a must-have, for MANY reasons: -Unlimited content -Tons of gametypes -Massive social game -Exploits your imagination -Create whatever passes through your mind JUST BUY IT ALREADY!!! I LOVE GMOD <3
== The Apex Predator ==;-;this game is fun and can be funny at times also!
Lil' Lulu;-;Garry's Mod is filled with wonderful communities and endless possibilities for fun. There is an ever increasing number of game modes and you'll never get bored!
EvilDead2Rules;-;Punched Zoidberg. Went on to a night server andlistened to children swear at each other. Went on another night server and ran into someone. Had a moshpit with friends. Stole someone's car. Went on to a small server and blew everything up. Went on to a server and spawned an army of headcrabs. Headcrab/10
MLP Nick;-;This is a very great game I would pay more or have like a special version so that most of the multiplayer stuff/files you dont need to download unless you have the game but other wise its very great
ForeSeeing Thumb;-;Much good    Many cool    Such awesome!    Wow.
Soricfull;-;Verry fun game to play with friends! For me it's the best mod for Half-Life 2! 10/10
Chacal Transcendental;-;Awesome game, totally worth the money spent (if not a little underpriced). Its sandbox mode is pretty cool, because of all the gameplay possibilities (even making movies... wow). Also has tons of gamemodes on the workshop, thus it never gets boring. The only con is that some gamemodes and maps require having counter-strike's source installed, or else your whole gameplay gets messed up, with missing textures, etc.
FaLLeN;-;Garry's Mod is an amaing game. There is so much to do, so many possibilities. There is new content avalible everyday, from the steam workshop, or even a new gamemode. You can play an old classic like Trouble in Terrorist Town, or you can play the newer Murder gamemode. There is so much you can see and do in Garry's Mod. And I will continue to play it in the future because of the growing community that makes such amazing things. I give Garry's Mod a 10/10
Withered Freddy;-;best sandbox creator ever! whether you want to mess around and laugh or whether you want to decorate your room. Anyone will love this game! defnitley worth your money
ian07123;-;why are you still looking at that buy button, you should give it a press then your mind will be exploded with happiness
RichBoundless;-;Still better than call of duty ghosts.
Orangegamer;-;Sandbox + Source Engine = Fun! Buy it now!
Master Hunter;-;Best game ever but even this isnt enough to explain how awesome it is!
Simply;-;Do you like mucking around? Do like being a d*ck to people? Do you like doing random sh*t with loads of fun and a ton of mods to download? Then this game is for you, probably one of my favourite games.. EVER!
Zestalicious;-;That game made my life. It's an incredible sandox game, and it's the best! You can do everything you want to do, and that's the kind of game I like. It's just the best game in the world. I will never stop playing. I you read this, buy it right now, or I'll come to you and BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN!!
Dashie010203;-;this is the worlds wakiest game ever and i love it sure theres glitches in it its fun
Jimmy the Cripple;-;A little bit more obsessed than I should be with this but its a pretty good game to get hooked on for a really long time.
Loq;-;Absolotely horrible game. Poorly optimized, meaning you need a top of the range PC to run it. Not enough game modes, So its really easy to get bored quickly. Therefore I cant see anyone playing more than a few hours on it. The very little hours I experienced on this game were pure hell, Thank god it was over. 1033.6/10
Dick Grayson (Robin);-;Endless things to do fun never ends. :D
Banana Guard;-;Absolutely a wonderful game, but it comes with some cons. You will need to download a ton of files in order to play on all the servers without any "ERRORS" or missing textues.
Portlandia_;-;It lasts for a while, then you download to much stuff from the workshop, thats the only time things get bad!
Tyronnee;-;ing hell getting ing banned on every ing server for ing meta gaming its  as  dont ing get it its a ing  game you get ing banned from every ing server and you feel like ing hanging yourself on a ing tree while ing smoking ing jack ing daniels and ing smoking that  weed and that ing smoke and then you ing realise  i was banned from ing raozor ttt for no ing reason and then you think to yourself, .
IHazNewName [FM.Useless];-;This is a fun game where you can do anything you want to do you can build many diffrent things you can create a TTT server and many things.
KGB_Kirill;-;Just amazing game, you can do whatever you want in this game. This game is worth more than its very cheap price and accomplished so much more than an average 60 dollar game does.
JakieTomi;-;Awsome!!!!!!!!
Haydnn;-;I joined A Dark RP server. A hour of playing later, I owned a garage filled with money printers, owned a radio, which i took into the main part of town while running really fast because of the cocaine i had just taken. I start playing "I'm Osama" by Rukka Rukka Ali. 10/10
ForgottenUsernames;-;The game about everyone has
Dreamwicca [GBR];-;A great game for any first time gamer or even a common gamer because what you can do on here is limitless to what your capabilitys take you to, there is fun and addicting games all the way through this and once you play this game you cannot stop.
Melon;-;It's a really fun game, eats away at time, awesome to play with friends, and easy to meet really nice people.
Metal Gear;-;You can't do anything on servers that the admins don't want you to do, so you get insta-banned... But except from that, it's a solid game.
Stickdude247;-;A lot of fun when you first get. Easier to get the hang of if you have a friend to help teach you. There's also really fun gamemodes, servers, & add-ons to see. Definitely my favorite game!
Xernius;-;Garrys Mod is AWESOME I have had so much fun downloading stuff and playing the game!!!!! :D
Simon;-;This game is the best around!
LNK;-;One of the greatest games up to date. It's filled with gamemodes, but you pretty much need Counter Strike: Source for anything to look good. Still pretty amazing. It's like real life, but not.
menduM>;-;You can play EVERY GENRES at once at this game! I would love if the developer is make a Credits and the theme song is #Lenka-Everything At Once. You bored coz u only have a few games? and u wanna play all genres at once? my answer is: THIS GAME! TOTALLY RECCOMMENDED, I'M KINDA ADDICTED <3 SUCH ADDICTED 10/10
defiaN #S;-;THIS GAME IS FUN! I recomend it for people that who likes to pose,build,making pictures and more! When you want to build anything its a little bit hard but you can learn yourself or ask your friends. THIS GAME IS FUN AGIAN!
Swaggety Ann;-;Garry's mod has provided my friends and I countless hours of fun. You can find many creative mods for the game, and as no goals are set in sandbox the sky is the limit allowing creativity unrivaled by most. If you have the funds, and don't already own it I highly suggest buying Garry's mod. Not Day one garry's incident which by no means should you even mention.
Arkangel Vigilamus;-;1787 hours spent on this game, 10/10 would play 2000 more hours.
Vadkatana;-;80% of server owners are 12 year olds who bugged their parents into submission, you can pretend to be their friend and trick them into giving you a lead admin role (takes about 1-2 hours). Use this to ban them from their own server. 86/10
Andy_mcLoL;-;Buy this game... DO IT U SON OF A NUGGET!
Uncle Engi;-;Typed Door. Game Crashed 10/10
illuminatilord;-;What are you waiting for? Stop reading the comments, purchase the game. BECAUSE THIS GAME IS INSANE!

There are 1000's of Garry's Mod Roll Playing Maps at Workshop just waiting for you to play on!

Sonic Friend42191430;-;i like this game but for the non gameing pc it so lagey
BluntDeath;-;To good of a game, so I believe you shouldn't get it if you like building and playing roleplay and PvP. I believe you should get it IF YOU LOVE THOSE THINGS
Jackie;-;goats are like mushrooms. when you shoot a duck, im scared of toasters. 5 Stars
SuperRage;-;Very fun sandbox game to waste all your time on!!
Pnotus;-;Hi i gonna review the so called "Garry's mod" ah, i remember when i bought this.... about 1.5 year ago i bought this game for 10 euro! no regrets! its like a new game everytime you download a new addon! as a PC veteran i think its a really well made game with a few glitches, not many! this game is one of those "must play before i die" game... this game was a mod in the beginning... A MOD FOR HALF LIFE 2? this is one of the best games i everplayed and you wont regret buying this, the sandbox mode is what i play the most, i love to play alone and make up scenes where im a soldier and im in a war between the rebels and the combines! buy this instead of that... what is it called? goat simulator or the stopid bad rats! 10/10 -Spy reviews!
ace nugget;-;i regret every minute i put into this game but i keep playing it
Mike (Turek) Wazowski #POTATO;-;Alot of french and german people. 11/10
SonicMurch;-;If you buy this game you will never regret it. I seriously have never laughed so hard in my life untill i played this game. Its just the greatest! theres so many kooky things to do its so cool!
I have a name;-;Well It is a 7.5/10, its really good for releasing your creative side make a floating castle or a car it world of imagination but i have experainced bullys on some of the server from DarkRP to TTT. To get around the bullys some tips and tricks 1. If you have a 'Squeaky voice' Type Instead. 2. Follow the rules 3.Dont be a minge.
Timmy-P;-;This game requires thinking, logic, physics, etc if you want some super-cool machine. However, if you want to just mess around, like spawn something and attatch a bunch of rockets and zoom around the map, you can also have fun with that, too. As for multiplayer, I have played on quite a few of them. Many of them have mods from freeze tag to team deathmatch to zombie survival, or just plain custom maps with a few extra tools. Anyway you look at it, Garry's Mod will be there to entertain you for hours at a time.
obscure.;-;A great game to play with your friends. You can do pretty much anything in there which makes it even more fun. That being said, there are loads of different mods to choose from, so everyone is able to find something to play here. You don't really see how time passes while playing this game, so that's another plus when trying to kill time on your own.
Gooch Seeker;-;Great game! Great community, except for the kids shouting in their mic.
Sandyman X;-;Great Game lots of fun
DarkNinjaYT;-;Garrys mod is one of the greatest sandbox games i've ever played in my entire life.But what really makes gmod a fantastic game is its addons like gamemode,ragdolls,weapons,vehicle,player model,and maps will improve your experience by 100%. You will spend over 100 hours playnig this masterpeice.one of the best games on steam.
Based Bear Jew;-;My squadron of marines and I sat content, and lazily around a roaring fireplace enjoying a bedtime story master chief was reading us, a story called Go the  to sleep. All was well until suicide bombers found and killed us in the name of allah.
heckler416;-;One of the most strangely addicting games I've ever played, I've had it for 1 or 2 weeks now, and with the help of friends I was able to learn the ropes relatively quickly. I've had it for a short amount of time and have already logged 172 hours on GarrysMod. It's so fun its rediculous. When I first saw this, I thought it was so sketchy, and didn't even look fun. But I broke down out of boredom and bought it. This $14 (now $10) was probably one of the best $14 (or $60) I've ever spent on a game.
Astromango;-;Garry's mod is worth its cost, for weeks, even months of gaming joy.
GoldClassGaming;-;Outstanding fun virtually endless playability
The Goblin King;-;"I'm happy knowing my hypothesis of Steam users being functionally autistic is accurate." Positive highlights of my great time spent on Garry's Mod: -Getting two children banned from a DarkRP server -Killing everyone innocent and traitor in TTT without evidence and stating over the mic "I had DNA." -Killing off a HL2RP community that circlejerks over eachother with their dark and edgy characters/usernames -Dealing with admins with superiority complexes -Hearing the cries and lamentations of children as I RDM them senselessly -Building "Outer Toll Gayt Heaven" in conjunction with a fellow friend -Meeting new friends and restablishing old friendships with those who know how to have fun -Roleplaying as a white supremacist -Roleplaying as an abusive cop -Becoming a space marine and having everyone laugh at your toned upper body -Becoming a whale hunter -Learning how to be a better father Cons: -Admins -Community -Screaming children -DarkRP -Trouble in Terrorist Town -Half-Life 2 RP -Waiting two months to join a server -Bronies -Furries -Stoners -Youtube celebrities turning this game into more of a daycare -Friends becoming addicted to Garry's Mod 5/10. It's okay. The community and lack of new gamemodes really make this unreplayable after a while.
SillyLittleGoose!;-;What can i say about garrys mod? Well it's the kind of game that you find yourself putting in countless hours of your life into. This game is very fun but if you wish to play multiplayer like TTT, or prophunt you also need other games like Counter Strike: Source, Portal , and Half Life to get all of the textures to play. So if your wondering about buying it you should i give this game a 10/10 by far.
JeffBrah;-;This Game Is Just Simply Amazing. Creative And Fun! Best Game to play with your mates
Ryasberry';-;Taught me Haw 2 Physx. Dan Outta Dan
{SK}GameGod311;-;Awsome Game :D
Adam West / Predator;-;Do you like Garry's Mod? Then you should buy this. Do you not like Garry's Mod, then you should buy this.
NPC Gamer;-;In a word... AWESOME!!!
King Mem;-;Garry wiped his  with half life 2 and made a   baby that was pointlessy fun and laggy and killing and andding and killing your family with you computer
Can't Stop Won't Stop;-;*cough*
Galactic Tea;-;A funny game a cool multiplayer sistem(killed by a wall) 100/10
TheLegionNation;-;After playing over 100 hours of the game... I can 100% say, I still don't know how to use Gmod... 1/0 Definitely would play again
Jones the motherfucker;-;By far the greatest purchase you can make for your computer. I have spent many hours playing this game and there is so much to do. You can create fancy artwork by posing ragdolls and props like me, or you can become good at building things with lua and wiremod. You can also play all these cool RPG servers and games like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Stranded, and Deathrun. Great game. Counter-Strike + Garry's Mod bundle source is on sale until December 3rd, I would highly reccomend buying it!
Dr. Bhatnagar;-;1. DarkRP :) 2. Sandbox 3. Trouble in Terrorist Town 4. Zombie Survival 5. MilitaryRP 6. Amazingness If you want a cheap sandbox that you can do ANYTHING with, I recommend you get this game. It is simply amazing. Now back to DarkRP.
VitaminZeth;-;Im no critic when I say get the game alright... After a total of nine hours playing the game, NUMEROUS mod testing and observations I`ve come to conclude that this game is meant for ANY type of gamer. Lots of ideal game modes, game maps, mods for extra weapons and the above. I really like how skins just make a whole diffrent experience while gaming in a new world as one of your favorite characters by Valve and etc. Lots of sick block busting weapons call out to you when subscribing to mods at the workshop. I highly recomend to check out what I am subscribed to (thanks to a little someone) and to TRY out the parkour mods. Adds realism to the already fictionized game world. This universal game gets you addicted after you finnally load that level, whether or not your online with peeps or just experimenting on your own blank canvas. I highly recomend a decent computer video card (NVIDIA if i spelt it right! Or anything that can run Fallout 3 - Elder Scrolls IV - Oblivion (Bethesda) ) and at least good internet to get a good ping. Most of my friends play Team Fortress 2, and my ping level to MVM servers or regular comunity servers is at your standard 69 -70. Not all bad, especially for Gmod, but besides some lag spikes and frozen computer screens you need to close down immediately with the task mannager, the Game is not that all a PAIN! I really like weapons and the maps, umm... Not really much to say now but to thank again those who also recomended Gmod to me, thankyou! Im just passing down the torch to one of the BEST FPS of all time! Side Notes - I may add more to this if i find more stuff out but so far besides how my PC handles it, its fine. Its worth the $9.99, but sometimes they hype down to $4.99 or one time: $1.99 on the market. But really all togethger just get the game!|
PurpleQuacker;-;Ah Garry's mod. The game with most under 14's since call of duty. Garry's mods possiblities are pretty much endless as their are tons of mods out their, and more coming everyday. This allows for good filmaking or just plain diccking around. The multiplayer is something to be wary of as there is pretty much a pre pubesent child in every server going around killing people or deleting everything your trying to create. Some servers try to restrict this by allowing no killing or deleting but this can also lead to other types of trolling like someone puting a fence over a door so no one can escape. Its pretty much a lose lose situation. Just be prepared to deal with these problems or make your own server with a passcode so you save yourself the brain tumors that are the trolls. Another problem you might face is the downloads on custom servers that will take 10 minutes and might not even work. Mind you this is only one mode of the multiplayer. As the name gives away Garry's Mod is pretty much a modders wet dream. Their are mods galore. Some of note are TTT-Trouble in Terrorist Town (best played with friends), Murder and Prop Hunt. These are game mods that add a whole new gameplay experience but you can also get mods for guns, cars, people...pretty much anything you can think of, its in the workshop. The singleplayer for Garry's Mod is pretty much for testing out your mods or just having fun with them by yourself. It allows you to set up scences or build awesome contraptions without any interference from the high balls. All in all Garry's Mod is a good experience with some friends in the multiplayer and is a good tool or filmaking and fun, the communtiy more or less is pretty cool, where you can find some pretty humorous blokes aye. I give Garry's Mod a 9/10! Just bring ear protection....
Col. BacoN;-;Garry's Mod is an essential for the creative (or destructive) mind to enjoy, In its vanilla state, GMOD provides many opportunities and tools to express your desire to create toilet submarines, or explode about 50+ NPC's with the RPG. GMOD is a hugely flexible (and sometimes unstable) sandbox when you mess around with the possibilities, including adding things like Wiremod to unlock the possibilities (or confusion) . GMOD, however, is not stand-alone, and requires a source engine game to power the experience, which shouldn't really be difficult to achieve, especially with TF2 being F2P. The game is also not only a sole experience, but an amazing multi-player world where anything can happen, which isn't always a good thing! The multi-player world is a interesting one, and some addons would be needed to avoid people messing up what you make. Maps, game-modes and infinitely more pieces of content can be added at your leisure, but performance will take a hit in most cases. As a flexible, sandbox, you would probably expect to be able to do almost anything, and GMOD pretty much does just that. For a measly few pounds or dollars, you can unlock a unique world that has almost no bounds to your creativity, which is what a sandbox is all about. Highly Recommended. Rated: 9.7/10
sunaaka;-;the most fun i have had with video games truly a game you shoud buy
William;-;The RagMorph makes you a ragdoll! (test it out in the workshop)
RadioActiveCoffee;-;This game is AWSOME!
XLightningBlueX;-;Its a good game to play when you have nothing better to do, and make your imagination run wild...
The Pan Man;-;One of the best sandboxes I've ever played. If you have never seen Garry's Mod, you're in for a ride! Tons upon tons of user-created content, guarenteed for hours and hours of gameplay. Note: HL2 and CS:S are VITAL for playing this game. Without the two, this game turns into an error-box simulator.
Morgan Freeman;-;love the game suggest you get all the textures before playing it but worth it
Chicken Fried Valentino;-;rdm ban pls hax /advert raid admin to me can i have admin pls can i be the mayo pls help stuck !stuck /advert you guys are gsy
Alakazam;-;Creative, fun pvp, lots of mods, AWESOME!
Allen Scott (Back on July 21st);-;This game allows alot of freedom contingent upon the gamemode. This is a very good game enviornment for those with a creative personality and a knack for self taught talents. I'v played this for awhile now and I'm avid at constructing badass contraptions. This can also be handy for finding model paths for those who use Source SDK.
Potential Pineapple;-;The best sandbox type game ive ever played. I wouldnt reccomend it if you only plan to do single player cause it gets a bit boring. BUT the multiplayer modes and even just a flat world with some friends are some of the best times i've ever had with video games
Hope;-;This is one of the most random games i have ever played it is very VERY fun and you can get many many addons fun to play with and yeah just if you want it...Have a great time!
Captain Throw;-;Garry's Mod is what's wrong with America. By giving nearly unlimited power into the hands of Shrek filled twelve year old nerd lords, you create games such as Murder in Prop Town and Trouble Hunt. This game is Satan's spawn and goes against the good Christian morals. As a member of the 1%, this game goes against reality. If you die in the game, you can respond. In real life, I can loot your body and  on your grave - without getting banned. Horrible game, 10/Donkey, better luck next time Lucifer.
longc;-;Fun game. Super relax when playing it. You won't be tryhard at this game which makes it so enjoyable.
[F2B] Gratwex;-;Lots of fun!
Flak_Is_Alcos;-;If you want a sandbox this is it. if you want a train simulator this is it. if you want a flight simulator this is it. if you want any game this is it. it gives you the resources to do everything, you just have to use them. its a great game for every thing. for 9.99, this is a great all around game.
Crouchyboy;-;I recommend this to anyone who likes to play lots of different games, because Garry's Mod has so many different gamemodes to choose from if you get bored of one to can just go play a different gamemode.
Goddess;-;In most of gaming, I would say Garry's Mod would be a pretty unique type of game in its own way. Without any singeplayer campaigns, or running off an FPS shooter. This game has made some top notch stuff in its latest years. Players have built giant robots and towers. While others create action scenes, like out of movies. Garry's Mod doesn't have a campaign, but makes up for it with limitless opportunities of playing in the multiplayer world. With it's many unique gamemodes made by perticular developers, or a group of coders. This game is certainly one of a kind. This game isn't meant for people are who love campaigns and are not as laid back. But if you are, this would be the game for you. ~ GoddessReviews
//RatedR4Ryan// working on P.Ms;-;Very fun game! Great way to connect with friends and meet new people.
@TheGamingMelonCameron;-;the best sandbox game i have ever played...its what game i go to when im bored and i have a ton of fun after that it is awesome i very much recommend this game to all of you

Der Nuclear Catzen;-;I spent 4 hours straight killing people by shooting watermelons at them and then crashed the game by shooting to many watermelons. 10/10 watermelons
Lieutennant Fluffy Ears;-;I couldn't poosibly think of another sandbox game I playerd for ovrt 1000 hours on except for minecraft. Let me just say, this game is ESSENTIAL to your library just to screw around with. If you like the source engine or Half Life 2, You'll like it.
Belgian Problem;-;Epic game, great community who loves to make the game different in so many way's. no matter what you like, RP, FPS simulation or anything else, than there will most likely be something for you in this game! 10/10
LongDog;-;Limited only by your imagination, garrys mod gives you a lego bin full of video game peices from as many video games as there are out there. With these peices and a large colletion of fun and interesting tools, GMOD lets you run wild from the start. Blow things up, make a giant robot out of road cones and washing machines, make a helicopter out of a lenght of rebar and toliet. if you can think it up and make a plan for it, you can very likely make it in GMOD And if the virtually limitless potential of single player wasnt enough of an insentive, there is a truely massive online store/workshop that allows you to increase you parts/ props/ models/ npc characters/ and everything for one low price of memory. Everything is free ( save for the game ) And on top of that, there are many many many multiplayer servers where you can mess around with others and have funs of goofy crazy fun. Just remember, with multiplayer, people can and will be moderatly insane/crazy. Afterall there is no social ettiqute, so you never know how one server will be when you first get in. But dont worry. If one server is full of rude people, or children screaming at one another. there will allways be another hundered to check out.
Lonky ();-;I RECCOMEND THIS SEXY GAME
FoolHardy WiZ;-;By far the most epic game that i have ever touched. You can pretty much do everything, from RP, to escaping pedo bear to kill terriorsts. This Game/Mod is so great just make sure you buy counter strike source to have the textures down. So many things that you can do with this game even if you are playing by yourself. I would say this is the best PC game and i switch from ps4 to pc for like 7 months straight cuz i was addicted to this game.
|aX| Rekoza;-;Another Steam Necessity, anyone can find enjoyment in this game, from simply using it as a way to practise fighting enemies or for creating complex and exciting contraptions with the large and expanding toolset provided by Garry and the countless modders taking advantage of the handy LUA system that has been implemented into the game. With countless gamemodes, maps and things to do this won't get boring quickly. The recent changes have made installing mods much simpler and possible within the game so big thanks to Garry for continuing to maintain this excellent game.
Triore;-;This is overall a decent game . You can literally do anything you want, and there is no story. You can put in any props, ragdolls, and npcs. You can create your own levels, funny animations, mess around, make race tracks, among thousands of other options. It also take elements from every source engine game (Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Portal, and Counter-Strike to name a few), and implements them into the game. You can totally mess up Half-Life and Portal this way, which is extremely fun. The graphics are the same as just about every other Source Engine game, which are awesome. Also, if all of this wasn't fun enough, then there is also a Toy Box. Basically the Toy Box allows you to download user made creations while you play the game. These can be new maps, weapons, and entities. Overall it's fun to play !
Caketake;-;You have so much freedom in what you can do in this game. It's basically a sandbox with no limits. Either you can sit back and create a little animation using ragdolls, or play on some of the various gamemodes downloadable. I highly recommend trying this out.
Master Merlan Calloway;-;Always fun to play around with.
ScatmanDosh;-;HEIL HITLER REPOST TO 5 OTHERS OR DER FUHRER WILL SEND YOU TO AUSCHWITZ
Tinska;-;Wait for addons to load simulator 2014 Free dlc that comes with the game: Crashes every 5 minutes if you're inactive
Marlon The Fish ><>;-;This is a really great game because it has a lot of games to play when you want to play different types of games. There are plenty of gamemodes to play that are different and are really fun to play.
Camo;-;This game is amazing for building what ever you want,There is also lots of differnt GameModes to play from jailbreak to Roleplay this is a must have game for anyone My favourite Gamdmode is Jailbreak :)
fnatic GAY-W;-;Yeah its good if you like: Zombies Terrorists Tension Murderr Weapons Mods Wardens 12 Year olds on crapy mics Hackers Swag

Happyzz;-;its alright
HomoSexualMelon;-;Its alright. I've played better games.
Jonathan (Octavius);-;It was a cold saturday night. My friends and I were very bored so we decided to go onto a DarkRP server in garry's mod. I scrolled through the jobs. Theif, Cop, Pet, Etc. Nothing was interesting until.... I saw it. 'Cult Member'. I knew what had to be done. I chose that job and bought a building and created my church. My friends soon followed. This was known as the "Cult of RevoMods". My friends and I went out and started asking people to come with us. Then we saw him. He was in a female vessel but we knew... I knew... It was him. The Champion of RevoMods. We captured him and locked him in the back room of the church. We took people who attended our sermons and locked them in there with him. He devored the corrupt souls of the world. However, He soon became corrupt. We sent him back to the heavens to live with RevoMods. Only... he came back. Stronger and with a cleansed soul. We kidnapped and locked more and more mortals in the name of RevoMods. Our church grew larger and larger. People did not like how large we were becoming so they constantly raided and killed us. Then, RevoMods came down from the heavens to help us! He dropped a 15 second bomb in the church. I locked the door. People screamed saying "Let me out! Let me out!" One guy was carrying the bomb in his hands. There were no survivors. RevoMods granted my friends and I another vessel to do his bidding. We moved the church and that's when we fell... The Champion was no where to be found. However, there were several murders around the city commited by him. The mayor was one.... Then came the raiders yet again. Everyone dying screaming for help and crying for it all to end. So it did... The Church of RevoMods was disbanded and never seen again. I checked the server lists for the server however, It was not there... I don't know what happened to it... but it was a crazy night. Praise RevoMods! Praise DarkRP! (RevoMods was the owner of the server)
Rev;-;good ways to kill times
BecauseOfTacos;-;Possibly one fo the best sandbox games ever made and will always be one of my favourite ones . Shame on you if you do not have this game , its a need in everyones steam libray. 10/10
Hazza56;-;amazing game. why dont you have it. you are mental if you dont have it.
[VADE] The Vadettax;-;ehh Its alright. I mean, they community is ehh and the graphics are alright
Mintaaaaay;-;Extemely Fun and Enjoyable... The possibilties are Endless!
Raskyy;-;Great game BUY IT NOW
Crls2699;-;Sooooo fun!!!!! Buy this game right now!!!!! You will not regret purchasing this game and it's worth every penny you've paid for this game!!!
idle fuck off;-;This is one of if not the best sandbox game of all times , this game was released in 2006 and from then this game was a hit and still is . The guys who made theese are genius with working phisycs mechanics and customizabile everything deserves the nuber one sanbox game spot. If you didint buy this game allready go sell some lemonade and buy it. It's a ton of fun and I found myself playing this for 3 days straight without break . Its got multiplayer wich is ADDICTING and I really mean it. When you start playing Dark RP or Trouble in Terrorist Town  gets real. Come on just give Garry a cookie. Well im not telling you to buy it but : BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT! BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT! BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT! BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT!
Taylor Swift;-;Ever experienced a game with over 100 different mods with hundreds and even thousands of people playing? Garry's Mod, also commonly referred to as Gmod has many different modifications with one of the largest growing steam community workshops out there full of fantastic creations made by the community, for the community. Now you may think that this is just another game like minecraft but I can guarentee this isn't, it doesn't have the best community out there but somewhere in the crowd there are always people willing to help out and have fun! The game itself is a 1st person styled game which can only really be described as... 'interesting' this game is built up from the community and not so much from the developers, so you can obviously tell it has a large input from what people want instead of what the developers want instead. With hundreds of different modifications out there full of people playing, you'll never get bored of what may be in-store the next time you start up this game. And if this simple review isn't good enough for you, maybe the different picture everytime you start up Garry's Mod (Gmod) may interest you.
ahhhh my nipple fuck gordon;-;Garry's Mod is a good game, even if you're not good at the construction. I personally enjoy exploring the servers created by others and seeing what they have innovated. You may want to consider buying the Counter Strike: Source package, because even though both are great games in my opinion, there is no doubt that CS:S will provide a full online gaming experience.
Ickleslimer;-;If your the sort of guy who likes inflating zombies and making them float aimlessly around a room, or building a diving board only to then blow it to hell without jumping it, then this is the ideal game for you.
AsM | Hodor;-;this it the best thing ever
Peat;-;Absolutely Wonderful. Perfect. I have no regrets. A motto i have with this game is, "If it doesn't have it, somebody made it." There is litterally an addon for everything from tanks to helicopters, to mechs and Pikachus. This game has sucked up my time. I love it. There is no looking back.
Pvt.Jackson;-;-join an rp server -kill the president -use heroin -see the evil admin red physics gun -tries to run away -too late -no rp reason for rdm -get ban 120/12 Would kill president and use heroin again

Golfalicious;-;It's cool and I get to make stuff
I Sharted In My Knickers;-;If you don't already own this game, ing kill yourself...Right now.
Lipton Ice Tree #Maximani * LGN;-;My experience with Garry's Mod Playing on RP server Killed an Admin Got banned 10/10
tehctaH;-;Threw a krabby patty at a player and killed him. 10/10
Syntax_error;-;Definitely one of the most fun games of ever played.. Especially with friends :D
Taco Man IXx;-;oh my gosh gmod is epic (: i love it you guys would enjoy it
Antique Doorknob;-;Garrys Mod, Uhhh where to start. I personally love this game. The physics are just.. I dont know anymoar. If you like humourous creations. And lots of gamemodes, This is the game for you. I dont know what makes this game so funny, Could it be over the 100+ gamemodes they have? Or just the fact that you could build the silliest things evar on here. If I had the money I would buy there company. There income is so great. Just because of this silly game. Its nearly impossible to not laugh while on this game. I enjoy this game so much. I just cant express how well put-up this game is. Which leaves me to say. BUY GMOD BEST GAME EVAR 2K14 720NOSCOPECOLLATORALWALLBANG. !!Gg No re!! All humor aside. Buy this game. This is a true experience. And I mean it.
[AGSY]sW;-;I can make anything. ..... 10/10 good game no probs...
TheJordanSixFifty;-;i've been picked on / cyberbullied on this game but im still ok! :)
A Insane Tiger;-;this game is just to much fun so play it, dont have it? buy it its not that expensive come on go have some fun and tell your friends =3
Janitsu;-;There's so much to say about this game, but I'm not going to force you to stay. Garry's Mod is the god amon all the sandbox games, theres so many gamemodes to play and so many ways you can play them, My most played gamemodes are DarkRP and Trouble in Terrorist Town. DarkRP is just roleplaying but theres so may ways to play it in, You can be a thief and raid or mug people or you could be a hobo and beg for money on the streets. Or you could have a Terrorists vs Civil Protection war. And so much more. Trouble in Terrorist Town is a gamemode were three "teams" exists, Tratiors, Innocents and Detectives. The traitors job is to kill every innocent and detective before the round is over, and the funny part is that not any innocent or detective knows whos the traitor. The innocents and detectives are then supposed to figure out whos the traitor. After about 900~ hours of this game I'm still not getting tired to start up Garry's Mod and have fun with friends. This is a 11/10 game in all the ways, even if you break the game you allways laugh becouse it just looks so fun.
Jeff The Killer;-;Full of fun, depending on which server you go in
The Abyss;-;Garry's Mod is a Simulator game where it is made for you to add mods and with its many Gamemode like TTT or Prop Hunt you will have your you Holiday Break playing this Game. I am however annoyed about the texture pack Problem. Where you have to have the game inorder to have the textures ready.
Kawaii Senpai;-;Joined a server. Spawned melons. Was praised for that. Became the king of melons. Threw them at my enemies. Game crashed. 10/10

Panda_Cry;-;Its a really fun awesome game and a recomend it to everyone
goinginsolo;-;its a grat game but lots of trolls and its also great to have fun with frends on a passworded server
elpololoco;-;it's allright i guess.
Croiss;-;Half Life 2 Sandbox! 8/10
3423Collins;-;This is a lag free game with lots of mode on it.
ale;-;Amazing game, best I have ever played.
Samdo;-;This game as limitless possibilites and a crazy amount of gamemodes. Garry's Mod is a game you are almost obligated to have if you want to consider yourself a real PC gamer. Although it does rely on lots of non open source textures like that of Coutner-Strike: Source, Half Life 2, and other valve games of that natures. There are still a few gamesmodes which you can play without them. I generally spend my time around serious clockwork RP servers; and think that is the highlight of the Garry's Mod experience. Both in gameplay quality and community quality.
Echo The Penguin _*MAFIA*;-;Its a Fun game To be creative and imaginite as much as you like Play with friends and more this Sandbox Pc game isnt just a ordinary game It has 2 sides to it 1.Sandbox 2.RP in rp your in a diffrent world where you basiclly have as much fun as you want in your own life You could be a medic criminal A cop its all your choice bit also remember rules apply such as RDM. SandBox Is Just imaginite Building make helicopters make jets and cars Make your own addon and just have the fun of whatever you build. Personaly I love this game you get addicted to it pretty easy But thats just my opinion Anyways Cya
Kresh;-;Nice game, though most of the players I encounter are little dip.
TheMagicalPyro;-;Fun game and many gamemodes created by fans/modders. Workshop is the best thing in the game with all the addons. I recommend this game.
claytonrs;-;Great game for mods ( obiously) If you want a map, it probably exists.
Annorexorcist;-;It's like, every game combined together.
Nerfblackops;-;Probably the best game I've ever played, forget about Minecraft here comes G-Mod!
MegaAquaKat;-;Its like all of my favorite things mixed into one game The only thing that peeves me is the texture or prop error. Everything else is okay though :)
GAS THE KIKES - RACE WAR;-;One of my most favoured games, so fun you can do practically what you want. I Recommend this game to everyone!

Keez Stillfer;-;fett awesome spel, try it out ;D
Void;-;One of the best Sandbox games I have ever played. It is modable, you can almost do anything, and it supports Lua!
Detective Chmilewsky;-;Look at my hours, that should describe it enough, right? Not only has roleplaying in this game for several years given me thousand of hours of enjoyment, but it also helped my writing skills, and made me the linguist I am today. Not interested in roleplay? How about base building? Base wars? Zombie survival of various flavors? Pirate ship wars? Running through a maze of traps with dozens of other players while three players are determined to set traps to kill you all? Space build? There are dozens more game-modes, and new ones come out every couple of days.

Boost1198;-;Garrys Mod has to be one of the best games on steam at under $10. It is very playable and really good to mess about with friends. This is one of the games that has also gotten me a lot of friends just from playing. If anyone has questions about it, just ask some of the people that love this game so dearly. I think that Garry has made a good game here. All the gamemodes are just so much fun to play, whether you are more into rolepaying or being a terrorist or murderer. All the games you want in the one, what more could you ask for?

You can do almost ANYTHING there are about 100 avaliable game modes to play on 3 of the most popular are: SandBox, Trouble In Terrorist Town, DarkRP. My personal favorites are the RP (RolePlay) servers. Because you can be the president, a officer, A criminal its almost like real life roleplay with all the custom content the server owners purchase. I definitaly recommend this game. 9.5/10

[G] Did Somebody Say Roflolzor?;-;Awesome. Half LIfe was Awesome. This is what ALL sandbox games should be like!
Hyperion;-;The best and most realistic 3D sandbox I know so far. Source engine provides quite realistic physics (not enough for a simulator, though), which when combined with the tools in GMod and many addons available for it, give you a huge ammount of possibilities- from making a car, boat, plane or a spaceship with oxygen, energy and fuel limitations, to a working cannon, radar, hologran, or even a primitive computer. You can program microchips by a simplified C-like language or wire several sensors, buttons and gates together. And you can enhance your contraptions with these things to make your very own sentry turret, autonomous drones, alarm system etc. Perfect for understanding how computer-stuff or programming works! However, the physics usually spaz and lag on complex contraptions, no matter how strong your computer is. Keep in mind that this is a HL2 mod, and in HL2 you pretty much can't find even 2 boxes welded together and to make a huge spaceship, you can probably say good bye to destroyability, walking around on-flight or realistic weight-management. Maps are also quite limited in this, it's enough for police chases or heli fights but definitely not good for jets or for simulating a B737 flight (you wouldn't even takeoff probably). And the complexity and diversity of this game also means that there are some bugs and performance issues, however the community is big enough to help you with pretty much everything (on Steam or Facepunch forums) GMod is not only about building and doing aimless things. It gets way more funny when you invite friends and do some deathmatches, derby races or just mess around together- a perfect Friday afternoon time-waster! But what I wanted to say is that it has many gamemodes, such as TTT (Gaben's most favorite game), Roleplay, Zombie Survival where you can even nail props together to barricade yourself, Prop Hunt, ZMod, Stalker, Sledbuild, Slender and many other things which you can freely get from the workshop when you get bored by one and want to play something else. So if you love playing around with physics, building cars, submarines, trains, planes or other vehicles, programming complex things which doesn't waste several kilometers of free space like in Minecraft, doing funny poses and taking screenshots or making in-game movies, arresting some bad guys, playing a survival, shooting zombies/terrorists or just to crap your pants with friends on horror maps, then GMod is a game for you (if you have enough time to learn all this of course).
|UDG| The Commander;-;Everyone should own this. You would be a r3tard not to. It isnt just some silly sandbox game where you put models into silly poses, it includes FULL differnet gamemodes that make it worth it. But make sure you own Counter Strike:Source as it uses a lot of the models etc. content from that game for many of the custom maps and games modes avaible.

Rogue Cheney [Away on Holiday];-;If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob a bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.
Hans;-;i wish i had more time to try this game out altered roleplay is the best community ever tho
Star_Hawk_;-;Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway. "Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm... _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more. _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore. _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds. _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want. _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10 Overall 8.5 Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

Valiantttt;-;Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.
Hoffa;-;You don't log 6000+ hours in a bad game if you get what I mean. http://youtube.com/Hoffa1337
FB||Gillan_Greenleaf | KinguWIN;-;When I first bought this, my friend said "not a game, bro." He was right. It's not a game. It is your world. Do with it what you wish.
Asian-chan;-;You can spawn watermelons. 10/10
orane;-;An amazing game. Truly the first game with infinite free DLC. With millions of maps and plenty of gamemodes, Its a win.
Oryx;-;I need to stop playing this..
[HotPocket]EnhancedGamer;-;great game
Mr.Rie;-;Best sandbox ever! love all the mods you can get from the workshop..... Highly recommend for those who loves create in-game stuff!

QuadraMoo;-;i think it is a great game
Regicide;-;If you own Half-Life 2 or Counter-Strike: Source you definitely need to buy this
Cityboy Central;-;The game is fantastic! You can do what ever you want, Race, Role Play, Even build a rollercoaster! But just don't download to many mods, It will crash.
CXimines;-;it rocks lol
masteraustin477;-;I'm not one for big complex reviews, but I have lots of great moments playing with friends or alone. I would give this game 10/10 but my menu always freezes on startup so i give this a proper rating of 9/10
Chloride;-;Ah, Garry's Mod. What else can be said about this beauty of a game that hasn't already been said before? Whoever had the idea to take Half Life, Team Fortress 2, and every other Valve Source-based game and packing it into a cheap little package is one brilliant guy. This game offers an endless amount of playtime, given the vast amount of gamemodes. Hell, you could get hundreds of hours out of a single mode. Don't feel like building crazy stuff in sandbox? Then hop on over to Trouble in Terrorist Town. Had enough of murdering your fellow terrorists? Prop hunt's always a blast to play. The community is where this game shines, creating some truly amazing addons to the game. If you don't have this game already, get it. I guarentee you won't be disappointed.
OMFG;-;Good game, funny, Cool addon, Sandbox and Creative Nice ! XD
Chris Smith;-;As soon as I knew steam added Reviews that you make, I directly came along to garry's mod, to tell the people this game is freaking awesome. It has ENDLESS possiblities. You can even do a pixel game in this gmod game, I recommand you getting counterstrike source with it cause you need textures/props. I've playin this game for 1829 hours, and im continueing! It has million gamemodes, the best one i like is TTT, DarkRP. Darkrp is Realstic Roleplay, I hope you saw this review helpful, thanks for taking your time to see this =)
DrTwinkleToes;-;this really is a good game i can tell u that cauz i have it and for those that dont have it i feel sorry for u so if you do really want it and u do have enough money ask your mom politely or your dad politely and they could buy u it thats what i did asked my mom politely if i could have it then i said its 5 guess wut she gave me it :D good luck getting it out there bye :D
Fin;-;It's amazing, it's absolutely hilarious
MuensterQ999;-;"Garry's Mod is often regarded as the most historically relevant electronic weapon in the history of the world. Garry's Mod runs on a next-next-gen super engine (often refered to as the 'Source' engine), and was outlawed until the second Canadian Civil War, in which it was used by the Canadian Freedom Fighters against the Canadian Fascist Legion in retaliation to their 'Half-Life 2' Source weapon. Garry's Mod not only uses all assets from Half-Life 2, but combines those of other Source weapons used by seperate, unrelated organizations including 'Counter-Strike: Source' (Used by terrorists in the middle east) and 'Team Fortress 2' (Popular among mercenaries intertnationally), using each weapon to their advantage. The Canadian Fascist Legion was inevitably defeated, and the Canadian Freedom Fighters next attempted to dispose of Garry's Mod. Soon, however, they found that Garry's Mod had not only acheived sentience, but was spreading through the internet at an alarming rate. What surprised the Freedom Fighters even more than this was that Garry's Mod wasn't destructive at all. On the contrary, it soon turned itself into a stable and usable program, similar in style to that of a video game. The video game company Valve took notice, and soon released Garry's Mod on its online gaming platform, Steam. After the extreme success of Garry's Mod, Valve made stable versions of all Source weapons and released them as video games on Steam." Quinn, Matthew . "Major Modern Wars and Advances (2020-2056)." The History of the World. New York: Muenster Publishing, 2056. 337. Print.
=(eGO)=|Rockloudly;-;A must-have game on Steam. With endless varieties of gamemodes, the gameplay never gets old.
[XOG] Zaddion;-;I highly suggest this game. I've made hundreds of new friends on this game. There is endless possibilities and a lot of gamemodes for you to chose from. Its even more fun when you get cool addons for the game.
Thanks for the Memeries;-;Over 500 hours logged. pretty much the reason I use steam.
Depy;-;Garry's Mod is unique and enjoyable, with an endless amount of different games to play and enjoy. Once you're into Garry's Mod, it's hard to escape it - it's extremelly addictive :)
TextuaryPlum;-;Absolutely great. Can provide hours apon hours of fun.

GreenFledge;-;Killed a guy on accident, got banned from server. 11/10
-DGen-;-;I can't believe I didn't recommend this before. This is an outstanding game where you can do whatever the hell you want. It's games like this that I truly enjoy. The workshop system is overflowing with neat new mods and maps you could screw around with and online mods that are an abundance of fun. I can see myself playing this game for many, many hours to come. It was worth the money.
Global Elite in Rocket League;-;You can explain this game in six words, PLAYING THIS GAME WILL NOT CAUSE BRAIN DAMAGE
YouTubeSoldier;-;VERY GOOD! I reccomend it to you. just have it its so good! =D
Get Rekt;-;This Game Is Awesome & Funny =) 10/10
Kungfu Penguin;-;I spawned a bathtub. I put thrusters on the bathtub The bathtub killed me who is the genius that made this game!
Proactive;-;Garry's Mod is one of, if not THE, best game I've ever played. It has one of the best communities I've ever seen in a game and pretty much where-ever you go you'll find friendly people. The amount of variety and things you can do with this game is unlimited as the gamemodes in multi-player range from Roleplay to Deathmatch to Hunting to Survival to whatever! Even if you just enjoy a game for it's single player, being a sandbox game, you can do literally whatever you want and if you take a few minutes to browse the workshop for addons then you're guaranteed to have a 200% better time. TL:DR You can launch exploding babies from a rocket launcher. 11/10.
Zoey;-;Garry's Mod has to be the best game ever. At just $10.00, you have a variety of gamemodes consisting of Trouble in Terrorist Town, DarkRP, Jailbreak, Deathrun, DayZ, Prophunt, Murder, Minigames, and many more! There are many unique players that play this game, as well as many chances to become a moderator/admin on your favorite server, if you live up to the expectations! Create a base and go out to mug people and steal, or build a gun shop with guards defending it! Sell drugs and illegal guns, or be a SWAT and bust into the criminal's house to put him behind bars! I currently have spent well over two years on this amazing game! I recommend it to anyone and everyone! Give me a friend request, and we'll play together!
Stalin_the_Organic_Meatbag[];-;well once you get into the game, the first words you will say is "WHAT IN THE LIVING HELL DID I JUST BUY!?" if so, that means it is working, if not- it is still working, but your mind is not working correctly, so I would get your brain looked at
RPINerd;-;I don't really know where to begin with Gmod. At it's core, it's nothing more than a sandbox to play in, no goals or points or leveling up. Just a gravity gun and an arsenal of crazy crap to spawn in. The interface feels a bit clunky to me, it took a while to learn even the most basic menu navigation keys, but once you get the hang of how to work your way around, you'll realize that the user generated content for this "game" is astronomical both in quality and quantity. I absolutely love Trouble in Terrorist Town and Prop Hunters. I'd reccoment picking up Garry's Mod just for those two game modes :D
eufedoric;-;so addicting fgts
Gee;-;awesome and funny game i recommend this anyone who likes building/making funny stuff :) i highly recommend it to minecrafters :3
I am a robot... beep boop;-;THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD, EVEN BETTER THEN MINECRAFT O:
XsyraX.exe;-;Great game, playing it for 6 - 7 years, never gets old :)
James;-;Garry's Mod is a 10/10 game. It has to be the best game I have ever played, by far. It is so different, customizable and totally different for every different player. There are restrictions at all! I highly reccomend this game to everyone; cheap, fun and plenty of things to do.
josephfra;-;Why are you reading this? Go play it!
Ben "Gents" Lowrie;-;My Playtime speaks for itself. But in case you can't see that, or can't be bothered, It is an amazing game. Haven't played too much but I have got 347 hours so far.

Fire Song;-;Does a giant Truck that shoots lasers and flies make much sense to you? If the answer is no, then you have not Played Garry's Mod. If The Answer is yes but you have not played Garry's mod, You should se a pyschologist. Anyway, This game is a sandbox modification of Half Life 2, designed to....well, you design it! You define what is logical, practical, or physically possible. With props from most source games used to define your world, This game is limitless. If You love designing, user friendly programming, or just beating everything senseless with a ragdoll this game is for you!
Altiar;-;IF U HAZ RAIN U WOULD PLAY THIS GAME FRO THE JailBreak
My Best Friend;-;Garry's Mod is the brainchild of Garry Newman, who wanted to create a physics-based sandbox based on the Source engine which also allows other players to create mods for the game too. So the game has a truly MASSIVE amount of variety. In singleplayer, you can build your own NPC arena, populate it with conflicting characters and watch them kill each other. On zombie survival, be a human fighting for your life while a zombie horde slowly infects the rest of your band of survivors. On Trouble in Terrorist Town, take control of a 'Traitor' Terrorist, and collaborate with other Traitors to wipe out all the 'Innocent' Terrorists, either through the use of a suicide bomb or sniping each innocent off, one by one. And in the excellent Dark RP, a multiplater role-playing mod built for the game, you start of as a citizen, but if you wish you can choose a different job, such as a police officer and take on crime head-on, or a mob boss with a gang the size of everyone in the server called 'The Tunnel Snakes' who own the cops through successful blackmail and bribery, or a sadistic gun dealer who's only pleasure is to kill everyone he sees, or a hobo and beg for money, or a hitman charging $100 per kill. Or just be a citizen and build. This game is fantastic!
xV3N0M;-;Love this game! Many different gamemode, create what you want, make it how you want. Get this game!
Buckwheat;-;Anyone who doesn't have this game, or has it but doesn't play it; must be CRAZY! This game is awesome,(my personal favorite game) and you can basically do ANYTHING.

[TAAG]SmiffyJnr;-;Best sandbox game out there. You recreate big title games and even make a game :D
Gamer4Life137;-;Got murdered by Batman while standing on a toilet. 10/10
[59th] TheTardis;-;Welcome to internet the game. It may not have the best graphics but I have been playing for months straight and its platability has not become a novelty to me. It is a life time supply of bacon and Kit Kats. It is a puppy and kitty offspring that looks cute. It is Grumpy Cat if Grumpy Cat were on acid. It is a lucid dream in which you are swimming in a pool of Nutella with Kate Upton and it turns out this lucid dream is real. It is Unicorn  (wonderful). :)/10
Petromilli;-;Insanely amazing game. There are tons of game modes with more coming out to the day! Its graphics aren't state of the art but they are enjoyable still. Garry's mod will fulfill the derp in your life. I recomend Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Death Run, Gmod Tower, Murder, and sandbox if you get the hang of it. (Sandbox will be very dificuly at first but once you understand and maybe look at a tutorial it is addicting) 10 out of 10 easy
Admiral Pancakes;-;This game is just GREAT. You can basically do whatever you want to. It's also good for making animations with. It has lots of fun gamemodes, a great community, and support for most games. Definitely worth my money.
All hail Buzz Aldrin!;-;Remember, if your computer isn't loaded down with buggy addons, you aren't playing Gmod right.
[Robo] Robotorian;-;I BUILD MY MEAT CYCLE OUT OF HEADCRABS!

Nikassasin;-;Really fun to play, the game experience never finishes with all the addons the mods, Its really fun to play with friends try all the mods, addons, workshop build and upload your creations to the workshop, The game is addictive :D
Crusty Bumnuts;-;Garry's Mod. A game created for thy gods. A simple mortal may look upon Garry's Mod and say to theeself, "Yo this gaim sux". However, with only a simple glance at the surface of this gaming miracle, it is logical for one to assume that the game is lacking content or any point at all. I, Crusty Bumnuts, beg to differ. All my life I have been searching for purpose. For a destination to bring myself to. I have questioned reality and mortality. I hath searched far and wide, beyond the limits of human imagination. It was when I had stumbled upon a beauty of virtual glory know to mankind as "Garry's Mod", that I had finally found my life's purpose. My eyes hath been opened. I saw heaven, I saw hell. I saw life, I saw death. I saw myself in the stars and in the earth, among my people, among the gods. Life was revealed unto me, and I saw for the first time in eternity, I saw what words could not be gathered to represent. I saw the line between reality and another world. I saw Garry. And Garry saw me. Together, Garry and I, forever. Forever in the land where grass is flat, and the sun was high, and the props flew throughout the land, and the sky fell into the earth, and the earth flew into the world, the world of life and the world of death, and into myself, and into Garry. And I smiled.
Eamon555;-;i is very fun and you can do "almost" do every thing!

Mr. TamiyaGuy;-;ing garry piece of  ruined after every update ing hl2.exe has stopped responding pile of  gotta download so many maps  he removed dynamite spam piece of wank  game 10/10
Umbreon;-;Genre: Sandbox Reccommendation: Anybody that likes even a little humor should play this game. Playtime: More than 20 hours, 300+ hours if you have friends to play with. Rating: 9/10 Review: If you're one of those people who are more like casual gamers and LOVE messing around and creating random things, this game is for you. Lots of derping and no goals, and there are even many custom, fanmade gamemodes available if you get bored. The game, obviously, allows for massive mod support, allowing you to use almost anything from whatever popular show, game, etc. in the game as long as it is in the workshop and is up-to-date with the latest version of the game. You can, for example, fly planes and helicopters, drive Need for Speed cars, interact with scripted (re-worked) NPCs like a Pikachu, and so on. One thing to note about this game though, the community sucks . Interacting with it can give many headaches. Most of the Gmod players are kids, so be prepared to mute players (IF the server lets you, which is another small let down).
Pengull;-;Garry's mob is just per fun. With so many Add-ons you can get the game is endless fun! Garry's Mod should be on everyone's Wishlist!
Glitch Goblin;-;This game is awesome!!! But, it was much better before this update. You know, with toybox and everything. :I But still. I reccomend this game!

Jukebox;-;Amazing Game! Everything you need to have fun !
Ever Temple;-;Garry's Mod, or Gmod. I started playing Garry's Mod when my friends told me to try out it. After few hours of playing I'm in love with this game. You know, the huge community building and crafting different type of game modes, which allows player to use their imagination to contribute the world. It's a fun game to play, I often play Garry's Mod now instead of other games. If you're a gamer who don't know which game to go for, I definitely suggest this game to you.
Waifu #100;-;Once you find the right server, this game is really amazing. You need to keep an open mind about EVERYONE who plays this game though. I usually go for very talkative servers and a few misogynistic guys pop up but overall smaller servers seem to have the friendliest people.
Renny;-;ohmygosh this game is freaking amazing, its exactly what I've been looking for, this sandbox game has sooooo much range and all kinds of different gamemodes, definatly worth the price
Big Red Brick;-;Their is absolutely no reason not to buy this game RIGHT NOW.
DJ-Bubblez;-;A awesome game with alot of replayibility SO BUY IT.
awkward SCOOT/DOOG ONLY;-;Given that I've wasted 325 hours of my life on it in the past 3 months, I think it speaks for itself.

Midbee;-;A very good game. The community is amazing with varied mods, servers and game modes, that help keep gameplay fresh.
[TR] Neversleepy;-;It's definitely my favourite game, as you might've noticed on my community profile. It's just unlimited fun, and I recommend it to anyone, for the young and for the old. There are so many things you're able to do, including building your imagination, and creating everything you like. I love the game-modes that are available for players to play, for example: DarkRP, or TTT. For everything there's a addon, and that's also one the things that keep Garry's mod so interesting, and so fun to play.
KyogreGaming;-;Great Game But Can You Make A Update Or Something to fix the crashes I get when i download large Addons
Frostshape;-;Love this game, itz like 20 Games in one,, Good Work Facepunch "Garry Newman" Really Excited for Rust aswell :)!!! Worth the money for anyone that likes RP, Prophunt, Building Whatsome ever you do what ever you want pretty much :D ! Love this game Worth Every Penny, No Regreats made on buying it
MrPridefulGamer;-;Killed the schools principal with pencils..... got banned from that server
UrbanFury;-;This game is whatever you want it to be. Tons of fun.
[RG] seinsei3(Son of Shenron);-;If I was in garrys mod and the person sitting in front of the computer was controling me,I would have fallen off cliffs, got killed by the combine, killed wallace breen (cause he is a freaking idiot),and many more things that would have all been a crazy adventure! And thats what garry's mod is all about!
AlanShadow;-;One of the best sandbox games ever. The amount of mods is simply astonishing, and I wouldn't even think twice about getting certain mods. On the performance front it isn't as good however, it can be very annyoing on slower computers, and even the more powerful ones are sometimes having problems. 8/10, purely because of performance issues.
ItsMe;-;THIS GAMES IS THE MOST FUN YOU WILL HAVE ON STEAM!!!!!!!!
Salt;-;12/10 This game. Fun.
Dark Matter;-;A fantastic game to play. 420/10 would play
Sir Jagalot;-;awsome game for all mods

Killermanwest;-;best money i ever spent this game you can do so much in, there is nedless possibilities
SaltedPeanutMan;-;It's very fun, makes my nipples really hard.
Posterus;-;The only game where you can drive the DeLorian to a 7eleven, nuke cities, spawn your favorite characters from your favorite games to kill a bunch of bad guys from your favorite games or good guys from your least favorite games, drive tanks and trains and sci-fi cars, play on any map you could likely think of, and even play with friends. You can do anything on here.
Galetovic;-;Best game ever so fun. Cheers Steam your the best.
ThuNda;-;Wasted 235 hours of my life to this game. Recommend 10/10
Miles;-;I made a Train/Plane hybrid 11/10 would play again

Brandon;-;Garry's mod is a awesome physics/sandbox game using the source engine, it is one of my favourite games to date.
sveti sveti drob i sarma;-;What can I say about this peice of SH-MASTERPIECE. Useful for making hillarious movies , also you can play some gamemoed except sandbox which is nice . Gets updated often which is good and if you would liek to derp with friends just make a private server and do it . Fun game 10/10
denk;-;this is one of the greatest games of all time. giving that it lets you do almost ANYTHING from making a movie to destroying a fort this is a game you should try today! (p.s. it has a great workshop with over 100,000 items on it!)
Omegaturtle;-;I recommend this game because you can have so much fun.
The Chicken Thief!;-;fun and addictive sand box makes a perfectly good time for almost any one. if you like a sand box this is the game for you also its amazingly creative.
KurbStomp;-;Its Gunna be MENTALL!!!
Tbone88221;-;A very good game that has high quality, and runs stable.
Althric;-;In my opinion, this is THE best Sandbox game ever made, easily beating others like Minecraft and Blockland. Why is it so good? You can do anything you want. Anything. Want to ride a bathtub on wheels? You can do that. Because in Garry's mod, there is no limit to what you can do. If you want something to happen- make it happen. There's just some assembly required, and that's your job.
King Theoden of Rohan;-;Trouble in Terrorist Town, enough said.
Lemonade Warrior;-;Just awesome with it's many diffrent game modes ( such as prop hunt or TTT) the fun never ends!!!!
Spiderpiggie;-;Go ahead and buy it, you don't need a life anyway!
GristlyDoughnut;-;Really fun game to play I recommend this game!
Masturbating Whale;-;I recall a battle between Dr. Manhattan and a T-Rex with laser-beams on its forehead. 42/10 Dr. Manhattan won.
ni;-;Bunch of game modes. Provides a lot of ridiculusness and fun. Tones of possibilites for gameplay
DriscollJA;-;The controlls are a little hard to use, but you can get the hang on them after a while.
Dragoge Shelly;-;I can pose people like they are having sex 20/10
CamBear-;-;It's a combination of Half Life, Counterstrike, Team Fortress, Call of Duty, Pokemon, My Little Pony, and even food. Yes, food. How could you not get this game?
intox. Installing gta V;-;This is a great sandbox game with so much to do. Great selection on items in its workshop. Really fun game to play with friends.
sam;-;This is a great mod to burn time on; It is full of different types of games - like trouble in terrorist town, or zombie survival. Not to mention countless ways to experiment with items and grav-guns. However, the only downside is if you buy it without counter strike source be prepared for half a dozen ERROR objects.
Hyperchaotix;-;It's buggy, it's awkward, but really it's anyone's game. The appeal of Garry's Mod is that it really stretches the limits of the Source Engine that can lead to moments of creative inspiration, failure to achieve it, which leads to an even better idea. The fun of the game is really up to you, whether it's admiring custom aesthetics created by hundreds of talented or hardworking people, animating stop-motion style with what you have, or just bending the world to your will with an assortment of things to spawn including Half-Life 2 characters available by default. A very interesting and sometimes under appreciated addition to the sandbox genre.
TERRAIN TWISTER;-;If you have a slight feeling of hesitation to buy this game... ignore it completely
Good Looking Shirtless Black Man;-;I usually get on GMod expecting to play some DarkRP for about an hour or so, then it's about 7 hours later and I still find myself playing it. If you have CS Source, and Half Life buy it
Host;-;How the  do you play this game?
Quack Attack;-;Can do fun fun fun fun. 9/10, would be better with more dongs
Prelec;-;I was a running fridge 10/10
Britney Spears;-;With the right amount of imagination, this game can waste your life away. Searching on the servers has provided me with countless memories and some people I will remember forever. Fun times!
Lionelk;-;There are so many things you can do in this game, it is one of my favorite PC games at the moment and I would suggest it to everyone that likes to mess around with some friends and have a good time. In my opinion 10/10.
Snacks;-;I've played this game for a while now. Started back in 2011. This game has provided me with hundreds of hours of content. I've been everywhere in this game. From TTT servers, DarkRP, Deathrun, HL2RP, and mostly every other major gamemode. Though, after 800 hours, I've drifted towards Half Life 2 RolePlay and hardcore roleplay servers in general. Since I have more fun there and I seem to have a knack for narrative based gameplay. So yeah, if you like to customize, push the Source engine to the limit, and play custom gamemodes that are challenging and time absorbing, I believe GMod (Short for Garry's Mod) is worth your hard earned $10(Base Game) - $25(Counter Strike Source + GMod) - $99(Valve Complete Pack) It's one of those games that you will keep coming back to over the years to play and check for new content. 10/10. I'm serious.
Etcheyey;-;Welcome to the realm of bathtubs and god awesome gamemodes. Take a shopping trolley, apply rocket boosters and a chair and BOOM. Grade A flying material. Take a sandbox map and turn it into Murder or Prop Hunt. The possibilities are endless. Buy now goobi pls do it make garry proud now do eet pls goobi yolo 360 blaze it swag please buy this game do it right now ill wait pls

MyInternetIsShit;-;This game is ing awesome. Period.
WOLF77710;-;pretty awesome game
caleb;-;to join this school RP server you must download the 2 gb battlefield 4 player model + weapons pack
Octomelon;-;Garrys Mod is great as a multiplayer experience. It's fun to mess around with friends, build contraptions, and battle each other. Exploring and manipulating content from your favourite supported games is great too. There are also lots of gamemodes that you can play, which arguably turn Garrys Mod into a number of smaller games in their own right (i.e 'Murder' which is basically like a violent first-person Cluedo). To say that Garrys Mod is a one-size-fits-all roleplay, shooter, building game, etc, etc is pushing it a bit. You can do all of those things, but often in a watered down way... to get the most out of the game, drop any expectations and go with the flow. Embrace the wacky physics, open freedom, and virtually endless user-created content. It's the best, and at times, iest game you never knew you needed. It's the quintessential Steam sandbox game.
Tierison;-;Buy this game or you will not enjoy your life :P
Something Creative;-;You can fly with a rocket powered office chair yes/10
Mixxy;-;It has watermelons

Darth Vader "Gone Camping";-;Amazing game,recommended for any type of gamer,though I have PS4 I still play it alot(Mainly COD gamer,but I also play FIFA 14,Battlefield 4,and Assassins Creed 4.) A must have, but remmember to get it with Counter Strike Source for it to work properly. :D
Pessie Shrinkman;-;just buy the game
Zoidberg The Spycrab;-;Most fun i've had in any game. Ever. Plenty of customization, addons, and game modes. But has a fair share of crashes. 9.5/10
-BlackBurn;-;Joined a server where people played around with NPC's, they made them have sex 10/10 - GameStop
Chandelf;-;Your missing out on life if you dont have this game
Good Guy Ridley;-;Garry's Mod (GMod) is quite a fun little indie sim, that requires you to do nothing and allows you to do anything! A love this game to bits and the community is pretty nice also. My only complaint: This game is pretty much useless without a Source game like Half-Life 2 (Ep 1 and 2) or Counter-Strike:Source. But other than that, I would recommend this game to anyone who is bored of the mind-numbing money grabbing games and just wants to have fun!
Zaephr;-;Kill your friends in the most creative ways possible. 13/10 would play again
Grand Dad;-;I am Adolf Hilter Quickscoping Pokemon Trainers.
Soarin' ringme;-;Fun once you know how to work things. :P

Harrison Deal;-;One of the best sandbox games I've ever played! Definetly worth buying If creativity Is your thing
Killomatic;-;Great Game! The endless possibilities you can create make it well worth the price!
TheDooieBall;-;Just why not? Look how many hours I have on it! At the time of writing this, almost an entire DAY OF MY LIFE has went into this. Very much worth it!
Marcuz;-;The only game I've chosen to put more than 2000 hours in. And every single one of them has been worth it!
Senapi;-;so bootyfull
CharlieBPlays;-;Absoultely amazing i love it soo much thank you facepunch for this game
CharlieBPlays;-;I love this game sooooooo much!!! All the different unique game modes like Trouble In Terrorist Town,DarkRP or Murder!!! Buy if you love to goof off in a game or just have fun!!!
James;-;This game is way too addicting, don't play this if you have a job or if you are doing exams, seriously. TIME FOR WIKI SPAM: Garry's Mod (often abbreviated as GMOD) is a sandbox physics game using a modified Source engine, created by Garry Newman. Garry's Mod has been available on Valve's content delivery service Steam since November 29, 2006.[1] In the past purchase of Garry's Mod required the user to own at least one game on Steam based on the Source engine, such as Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Portal, or Team Fortress 2,[1] however as of May 2014 the game can be purchased by itself on Steam. It is also commonly used for the creation and publishing of videos[3][4] on YouTube, mainly from Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2, Portal, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. Garry's Mod was originally a modification for Valve's Half-Life 2, but was later made into a standalone Steam game that was officially released on November 29, 2006 dubbed Garry's Mod 10. The current version, Garry's Mod 14.04.04, was released on April 4, 2014. In February 2014 it was revealed on Twitter by Newman that the game had "just broke" US$ 30 million.[5] As of November 2013 the game has sold 3.5 million copies. Although Garry's Mod is usually considered to be a full game, it has no game objective and players can use the game's set of tools for any purpose whatsoever, although sometimes when playing on a multiplayer server it may have role-play or other types of game modes. Garry's Mod allows players to manipulate items, furniture and "props"  various objects that players can place in-game. Props can be selected from any installed Source engine game or from a community created collection. The game features two "guns"  Physics Gun and Tool Gun for manipulating objects. The Physics Gun allows objects to be picked up, adjusted, and frozen in place. The Tool Gun is a multi-purpose tool for performing various tasks, such as combining props, attaching them via ropes, and creating controllable winches and wheels. The Tool Gun is also used to control add-ons created by the community. Another popular Garry's Mod concept is ragdoll posing. The player can instantiate a ragdoll model from a Source game and pose it using a variety of tools.[7] This is a popular tool for making fan-made videos and machinimas. Garry's Mod takes advantage of the Source engine's modified version of the Havok Physics Engine,[8] which allows players to build contraptions that follow the laws of physics. In winter 2009/2010, a contest was held for Garry's Mod by the game's developers to create the best new game mode using a programming framework called "Fretta".[10] Fretta, Italian for "hurry", allows developers to quickly and easily create new game modes for Garry's Mod with commonly required functionality already implemented so the developers can focus on unique aspects of their game modes. Fretta was inspired by a similar fan created framework "Rambo_6's Simple Gamemode Base". However, for inclusion in Garry's Mod, Newman decided to rewrite it with input and contributions from the original author and other developers.[11] The winners of the contest range from a recreation of the Mafia party game to an aerial combat game mode.[12] The contest winners have been included in Garry's Mod with their own Steam Achievements.[13] Three of the winning games have been shipped, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Dogfight Arcade, and Prop Hunt. On September 7, 2010, Newman added a feature called the "Toybox" to Garry's Mod.[15] It utilizes the Amazon S3 service to download third party content, such as weapons, props, maps, game modes or models, directly to the users' machine while in game. In an interview with GMod news, Garry Newman said that "One of GMod's biggest draws is the amount of third party content. I want to make it easier for people to utilize that. I really want to move away from having to download files from websites and drag them to folders, thats old school. So thats what Im heading towards. Maps, models, saved games etc., all saved on the cloud and accessible with a click. Everything should be accessible from in-game. If it isnt, Ive failed
Finwey;-;OH MY GOD WHERE HAS MY LIFE GONE THIS GAME IS JUST SOO AAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
Ed;-;If you get this game your life gets 75% better
lakotatbh;-;11/10 Made all my internet friends through this game, totally recommend this game.
Sgt.Golden;-;You need to play this game
Chica's Aspect;-;it is woth da money
Squid Kid;-;this game is filled with autism it is fun if you troll the brony  and stupid fat kids
Barclays;-;Its an awesome game, but it takes awhile to download all the textures
Alpha;-;This game is just too much fun. So far, I've played over 1750 hours of this awesome game. You can do so much stuff on it with all of the different gamemodes that have been made, and are still being made constantly. This is a must have. 10/10
Kimpanion.Cube;-;If you are looking for a fun and entertaining game to do just about anything...actually literally anything, if the game can't do it, there is probably a mod that can! Garry's Mod is a sandbox game where you can build, battle, swim..? I think.. Anyway it's amazingly fun no matter how boring i'v made it sound, it's kinda like Minecraft but better graphics and no giant spiders...unless you get the mod. If another game get's boring just load GMod the endless possiblities make it impossible to get tired of. There are also ragdolls, and the other games you have, props and ragdolls from that game gert added to Garry's Mod. So yes i definetly recommend Garry's Mod, it's worth the $10.00.
bogsaxe;-;Where to start with this game? Well lets just say the graphics arnt great and its not really classed as an amazing game however it is extremly fun if you know how to play it. With hundreds of diffrent game modes to choose from the fun never ends. Downloading all the stuff can be anoying but that is just so servers can increase the fun level. I am saying the word "fun" far to much but genrally that is a one word description of the game. Many people believe it is only played by six year olds despite the fact that it has a whole range of age groups on. Yes it may have a few young gamers playing but what game doesnt? This game is probably the ebst sandbox out there and the other gamemodes are great to. Anyway I would recomend anyone buying this game as it is really cheap, easy to run and extremly fun!!!!!
TNGevilcow;-;10/10 10/10 10/10 such goodness many funs
ok;-;Randomness overload.
Brady;-;A must have steam game, So much fun out of this game.
1 Shot;-;This game is really fun. You can make whatever you want, shoot terrorists, or host your own server! You need a Source engine game like L4D2, HL2, ETC. If you want fun times with your friends, this is the place to be!
Aycardus;-;A large portion of your life will be consumed when playing.
AleK;-;This has been an amazing game for me for a very long time. If you have steam, you need this game. I have never had more fun on any other games, and as you can see, I have other 2,000 hours on this game, yet I'm still not even close to getting bored of it. I got this game in 2011 and I still haven't even done half of the things avaible to do. I have had so many fun moments with my friends on this game, I also gained a lot of friends from playing this game. I'm pretty sure I got around 145 friends from just Garry's mod. If you get this game, you will never get bored of it. More and more servers, gamemodes, addons, and updates just keep coming to add to the endless amounts of fun you can have on this game. I have done so many different things on this game and almost all of, I was having so much fun. It may sound sad, but to be honest, the most fun I have ever had was on Garry's mod. It is an amzing game and I think everyone should get a chance to play it. If you actually read this entire review, thank you, and please buy this game.
Combatant007;-;Good Game for Timepass This Game is really Good and is available at cheap price, Sandbox Genre, really good for creativity type and you need to know some basic science to apply for this Game. Any Source Engine game needed to Run this Game. Played it 3 Hours Straight cannot get enough, keep making some new things like cars, house, lifts, Raild road, etc. Default maps are pretty good but you can download more manually created maps online its easy and simple. Gameplay is Good but with lot of Bugs and all. Runs pretty smooth on any Low end PC also. Its Fun to play with Friends and Graphics is not that Good nor very Bad. Its Average like Half Life 2. Over all Recommended 8.5/10
nXs-iNfAmOuS;-;No words to say,,, You can spent hours having fun with your friends...;)
CK | Galaxy;-;Ah, Garry's Mod. So many possibilities, yet so many disasters... This game, could either be one of the best you've ever bought, or maybe one of the worst. I say this because you really have to put the time into the game to understand the tools and such. You will slowly learn how to build, weld and create things. Or if you don't feel like doing that, you could just go on and endless rampage, slaughtering npcs. All this is possible due to the Workshop. You could customize your Garry's Mod into a Zombie Apocolypse, or a murder, or anything you want. You could literaly build anything you wanted if you just tried hard enough. Those who hate this game, often have not spent enought time on it to enjoy the building, or the Multiplayer, or to look through the Workshop! This game is unique... This, is Garry's Mod.
Nadez;-;A Very Nice Game And I Love It
{TFT}SheeplockHolmes;-;Awesome game, awesome minigames. BUY IT NOW!!!! FOR THE WATER MELONS!!!!!!
Leopold;-;rediculous cheap for those awesome mods :D
Ikkoops;-;If I could only pick one game to play for the rest of my life, it would be Garry's Mod. Best 3.99 pounds I ever spent, 1500 hours of gameplay
snoreo;-;"I built a rocket... out of barrels" 10/10
Piscaso;-;You can do literally anything with the workshop and over 322,000 mods Only problem is that you need a few games to have everything work properly. So the whole game is not exactly $10
Cpt Warisarcy;-;An endless possibility of things to do. A few of the things I like to do is play dark rp and gmod theater.
XxI'mDepressedxX;-;I love Gmod, It's really fun and a good way to get creative. I recommend playing this game!
FartsyHop;-;this game is just soooooo round!!!!!
A ****ing Board;-;This is a game where you build what you want,you kill your friends in TTT,or just go out and mess around, this is Garry's Mod,
jfx.;-;This is in the best sandbox games of all time list of mine. It is a must buy for PC gamers and regular Steam users. You have to get CS:S and GMod together for textures. Basically when you install it go to the workshop download 200 mods then spawn in random  and do fun physics stuff then play prop hunt and play trouble in terrorist town. Jailbreak is good too.
Vynom;-;Awesome! I absolutely love this game and would recommend this game to anyone. Even my worst enemy! I have one problem which is the missing textures on some maps but im trying to save up for Counter Strike: Source. Best game EVER!
[QG] The_dragonic_assassin;-;this is a fun game that anyone that likes gamemodes and multiplayer games will love
Koolaidesha;-;This is a good game lots of fun but very frusterating i mean very frusterating it is so annoying sometimes but when you get in a game its lots of fun :D
knaveHearted;-;It's kind of hard to review a game poorly, when it has almost everything.
DeltarinS;-;Whether or not you want to build a base, kill zombies, or just fool around, this game will NEVER disappoint you,
ThePortal2Master;-;I LOVE THIS GAME 11/10 You can spawn EVERY THING Also i love Steam Workshop lol
Sergeant Max;-;dude! BEST. GAME. EVER. You might think this is a Sandbox game, but you can turn it from derping in a private server too push you're survival limit's in a zombie apocalypse! Everything is possible, pretty much

LemonYourAid;-;Hours and even days of entertainment.
[TRS] Ace;-;"Great! Fun and Addicting!" "Hours of laughter!" I absolutely love Garry's Mod! I play this game a lot. Hours: 1824 - Crazy right? I just can't stop playing it. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves to play with friends and sandbox games. This is certainly a game you want for Christmas! 4/18/14: Recent news: Garry's Mod has a small virus leak. Currently Being Handled!
Haunted Weasel;-;Very nice sandbox game, if you love the game and still have not received the sandbox world's largest stupidity've done. Seeing the photos made new friends in the game, the game should not take the gas to come to in the game make photos for at least 2 years experience is required and the game alone something not so the game servers and add-ons for most of the CS: S and EP1-EP2 on the board, if a good gameplay if you want to get these games, you must have fun!
Captain Piggles;-;This game I've played for years & I still do, I paly Mostly RP & Sandbox But great time waster when you're feeling bored Sometimes may be a bit buggy But At the end of the day It's money well spent. Only Issues I've always hated Is the fact you've got to get certain games for the textures etc, It should really be put in rather Us wasting a bit more money on other games to get the textures. But overall 9/10
Chuck;-;Great game. Different gamemodes to play with, so you never get bored. Could also create your own creations with the tools provided. This can be done in single player or multiplayer.
Thunder41;-;Awesome Game.Totally Worth The Money
XXX GAMEPRO;-;so fun the best game ever
danked.me | Sora;-;Garry's Mod is a free roam sandbox game which you can make and or build anything you would like. You may also join servers with different gamemode such as DarkRP, Zombie Survival, Deathrun, Bhop, and Trouble in Terrorist Town. If you are looking for a game that you can do what you want, this is that game.
viperbjw2;-;This sandbox physics game is THE most versatile game EVER! So many variations and variables a supercomputer would fry thinking about them all! Online multiplayer, hundreds of game modes, models, maps and workshop items! This is my #1 game as far as hours played, check it out now!
para;-;Should probably play this someday.
Uso!;-;Really enjoyable game. Has near unlimted types of gamemodes with the community constantly providing new and interesting content. Modding a mod, modception!
Subzero;-;Great
TheScrubbingNub;-;I made a floating/flying rocket powered car, then launched it. No steering, eh dont need it. No stopping/brakes eh who nee....*Crashes into the ground*. Dr_St3ampunk killed by world. LOOOOVE THIS GAME
Smitty;-;What can't you do!
dedobeness (DS1);-;super amazing game, everyone should own it!
Beefyrulz;-;Stop what you're doing right now, go get your credit card or debit card, Get this game. You cannot own a Steam Account if you don't own Garry's mod. I can't even beging to explain how much playtime you will get out of this game, and I can not recommend it enough. The only really bad side about this game is the fact that you need other source games to run it (Like CS:S, HL2, TF2, etc.) Although for those of you that don't fully understand that, You really only 'Need' HL2 and CS:S. Aside from that, The community is really good (for the most part), and there's almost always something to do. I mean I've literally spent a thousand hours and some change playing this game.
Stealthy Wolf;-;Best game ever if your thinking of buying this ... DONT THINK BUY IT RIGHT NOW. You get murder its a game where you get to kill your friends with a knife along with countless other gamemodes if this dosnt convince you go to youtube seannaners murder or ttt that will convince you.
Alpha_GamerHD;-;is fun
Thewatcher21;-;this is the dream game of mine i love it but i feel like its not for every one try it at your own risk
J-Mann;-;Buy this game if... -you enjoy randomness -you want what is practically 50 games in one with all the diffrerent gamemodes -you enjoy creating cool contraptions from scratch -you want to have a 'what just happened?' moment every 10 seconds
Ms. Zee;-;It's pretty fun for the creative mind. It's a lot more fun when you're playing with friends and do role-play. If you don't already own Garry's Mod, then you should definately think about getting it.
RyachuGaming;-;This game is one of those games where you can pretty much do ANYTHING. Amazing and worth the $10.00!
sense;-;ahuje, narm geim0ns, very experience, such fun, many enjoys
Get Clapped Son;-;THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER SO MUCH TO DO ON IT 10/10.

IHazNewName [FM.Useless];-;This is a fun game where you can do anything you want to do you can build many diffrent things you can create a TTT server and many things.
KGB_Kirill;-;Just amazing game, you can do whatever you want in this game. This game is worth more than its very cheap price and accomplished so much more than an average 60 dollar game does.
JakieTomi;-;Awsome!!!!!!!!
Haydnn;-;I joined A Dark RP server. A hour of playing later, I owned a garage filled with money printers, owned a radio, which i took into the main part of town while running really fast because of the cocaine i had just taken. I start playing "I'm Osama" by Rukka Rukka Ali. 10/10
ForgottenUsernames;-;The game about everyone has
Dreamwicca [GBR];-;A great game for any first time gamer or even a common gamer because what you can do on here is limitless to what your capabilitys take you to, there is fun and addicting games all the way through this and once you play this game you cannot stop.
Melon;-;It's a really fun game, eats away at time, awesome to play with friends, and easy to meet really nice people.
Metal Gear;-;You can't do anything on servers that the admins don't want you to do, so you get insta-banned... But except from that, it's a solid game.
Stickdude247;-;A lot of fun when you first get. Easier to get the hang of if you have a friend to help teach you. There's also really fun gamemodes, servers, & add-ons to see. Definitely my favorite game!
Xernius;-;Garrys Mod is AWESOME I have had so much fun downloading stuff and playing the game!!!!! :D
Arkham-Fx;-;super funny game, very original, 9/10 would bang!
the twinkie god;-;this game is as awsome as a taco coverd in bacon diped in dounuts mad in valhala viking brofist
Voileip;-;This was really fun game to play with alone or with friends.
Sawbihr;-;If you like children screaming in a microphone for countless hours alongside your best friends also screaming through a microphone then I reccomend this game. If not, well that sounds like more of your problem than mine.
Daran;-;It's game what has games in it. You can be terrorist and betray other terrorists, or you can be a prop what is trying to escape from seeker. Isn't it beautiful?
Hydraker;-;This game is an amazing 90000/10
Maxzloch;-;Garry's Mod is an FPS. A zombie survival. A hide and seek game. A builder. A hunger games simulator. A movie maker. A racer. A fighter. An RPG. A murder mystery. Garry's Mod is whatever it wants to be. Or whatever YOU want it to be.
Elitist;-;This game is literally the only reason Half Life is selling any ing copies as of right now. And, honestly? It's worth it. If you love sandbox games, and this and Half Life 2 are on sale, just buy the darn game, along with Counter Strike: Source. You will not regret it, when your game is free of purple and black error text. This game is the game for those who are bored, you will ALWAYS find something to do here. Whether it's building, Prop Hunt, Zombie Survival, or the famed Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), you will eventually find your places here, and use it for many years to come, as I and MILLIONS of other users have. Enjoy. :^)
Rmaca99;-;This game can only be as good as your imagination
Sloth of Sempiternity;-;Probably one of the best PC games of all time, forget those default modes, like CTF or Free for all, this game, right here it the king of game modes. Although when buying this game, I recommend buying other valve games like CS:S, Half life 2 and TF2, just so your games is smooth without any graphical errors. This game is fun and addicting, I've played over 1000 hours on this game, and I'm still going. 10/10
Atlas;-;Probably the most fun game to play with friends!
IronRhino;-;A very fun and creative game, awesome phisics engine for building stuff and awesome to go onto gamemodes like TTT which is one of my favorites, I highly reccomend this game to anyone thinking about it. (You should probobly get CS:Source to help with the textures which is also a great game)
Flaperjacker;-;I DONT NEED TO REVIEW THIS. ING YOUTUBE REVIEWS. 8.09x10^45(SIN X)/ 20
Cman3144;-;Garry's Mod.. What more could you ask for? A game where people can build, roleplay, do custom gamemodes, and what ever you could imagine.. Its just a remarkable game... Anyone who says other wise is either a little 8 year old troll or some idiot.. I mean really.. This game is awesome.. If your into roleplaying there are over 100 servers to choose from! And many diffrent gamemodes.. I can't say anything else really.. Its just amazing.. I HAVE To Recommend This Game.. All my friends play it.
Juju!;-;This game will provide you with many hours of gameplay with your fellow players. Highly recommended if you like multiplayer.
NiggaTowel;-;Shanking 10 year olds is fun
Waffles;-;Fun for the whole family. Especially if you wanna be a drug dealer, policeman or traitor to a terrorist organization.
Po;-;you should own this  ;p
A Rare Kinda Piggle;-;Can build a tub full of babies and ride it down a icy hill..... 11/10 would play again
Columbidae;-;You can't go wrong with this game. With an endless sea of mods, gamemodes, and maps, you'll never get bored, and you'll definately find something you love in this game, no matter who you are.
Deciduous Pineapple;-;Be forewarned! Ye of which hath bought this game, shalt waste precious time wasting many-an-hour into all of the various gameplay modes, maps and such. Once in the clutches of this beast, ye cannot return from whence ye came in the gaming world. "Also, 10/10, best game 4 life, great story, could've used more dogs." - IGN
Period;-;i lost a portion of my life because of this  buyers beware
Nat_the_Potato;-;Played 2000 hours Still takes me 30 minutes to join a new server 10/10
Elly;-;It's a really great game! :) I highly approve it for people who prefer sandbox games, or games that you can alter/modify. Sure, I recommend this game because I have a bias. But, hey! That's what that little button's for. I really enjoy this game because of the other modes, and the multiplayer mode. I also admire that you can download High QUality mods, and they still turn out that way. It goes the same way if you have a lower quality model. I really recommend this game for people starting out on Steam, or starting out with any genre of games as well. Have fun! See you in game! <3 AnimalGalaxy
Cesis;-;Its fun cool and lot of players
Rhaphidophoriddae;-;Epic. (Nothing more to say because it's so good)
Rick;-;Best game eva 10 out of 10
Spessarite;-;One does not simply hate Garry's Mod.
The Joker;-;The game is fun but gets boring at times
BiscuitFarmer;-;Its a game
Soricfull;-;Verry fun game to play with friends! For me it's the best mod for Half-Life 2! 10/10
Chacal Transcendental;-;Awesome game, totally worth the money spent (if not a little underpriced). Its sandbox mode is pretty cool, because of all the gameplay possibilities (even making movies... wow). Also has tons of gamemodes on the workshop, thus it never gets boring. The only con is that some gamemodes and maps require having counter-strike's source installed, or else your whole gameplay gets messed up, with missing textures, etc.
Time_Lord_Ninja;-;I'm not going to say this is the best game I've ever played, but this is one of the best games I've ever played. Aside from brutally amazing destruction and gore games which also have a plot and even sometimes multiplayer, this game is amazingly fun alone, if you like, or with friends and strangers. It's major variety of game modes and its friendly interfaces and idea of building upon itself with other games is superiorly amazing. I suggest you buy, it's not too expensive and pretty easy to use. Also, I suggest buying the games it supports for its addons, and their DLC. This game gets a 10/10 for me even with less graphics than expected, it's ability to change what it is in all cases makes up for anything, even glitches(which can be funny as heck anyway, except for when you get stuck.) Kudos to the creators.
[UNAA] Wrappy Wrap;-;If you like derping around, this game is made for you.
Donald Trump for US President;-;For a game with almost no goals, the possiblities are only limited to your mind (and Garry's Mod's capacity to work). I myself have spent far too much time laughing, exploring, and goofing around playing the game, and the many gamemodes that go with it. Even if your not interested in the particular gamemodes, sandbox mode still is a great feature to play around with. Great game, funny people, win win situation with CS:S
Monkeyoi_;-;awesome. just pure awesome :D
Kate|Rainsobow;-;Nice game . You can build hydra walking chair . Scenes of TF2 CS:GO and add Dopuruujem kupit :3
[MNI] Mr. Derp;-;Endless fun! Loads of different gamemodes in one game, so when you get bored of one...you can just go off to the next!
Codissius;-;This game is a highly addictive gaem to play around with. Wether just in the sandbox fooling around, or trying to figure out who is the traitor among you, This game will have you hooked like a fish. Although I must throw in a disclaimer as well. If you don't have Counter Strike: Source in your list of purchased games, then you will find yourself staring at a map convered in a checkered patter and objects showing up as an error sign. NOT FUN. But I would still play this game true or not.
Riekelt;-;Really that one game where you can do everything. Also a wide variaty of maps makes it a great game. And it keeps increasing everyday. It can handle from Half life 1 maps to the groundbreaking graphical quality of Black Mesa. Really a great game.
MrBobSomething;-;I think this game is great. It has all the fun ragdoll physics of the Source engine and a bunch of wacky stuff you can do. All Source games add content to Garry's Mod and even if you don't have any Source games, you can download tons of content off of the Workshop. I love this game.
Sean bean;-;The only competetitor is "Dom s'yrrag" Garry's Mod pirate brother from a differnt planet, brought up together but become bitter and jelous of Garry and betrayed him
Dexterity;-;Really funand there is limitless gamemodes to play! Would definately recomend buying!
Davefarious;-;It's Garry's Mod. What else?
xXPHANTOM__REFLEXx;-;Brilliant sandbox game i would recommend to anyone, and the servers are a big bonus to add on to the game Franchise
Steverino_;-;it is the most fun i can have
HoZzMeBeazt;-;Great fun when you've got a friends :D
Ch tch H Ch Minh;-;This is a great game. It reminds me of an old game I use to love called Roblox.
Beasty;-;this isso freaking awesome add me and we playtogheter :D
Jesus  CSGOFAST.COM;-;Garry's Mod is Great! I have about 300 hours total on the game so far and it still hasn't gotten boring. With hundreds of different gamemodes Garry's Mod appeals to a very wide variety of gamers. Some of my personal favorite game modes include: Dark RP Trouble in Terrorist Town Deathrun Sandbox Zombie Survival Pirate Wars Garry's Mod is loads of fun. I highly recommend purchasing it.
Swaggyllama;-;Fancy
EllisC009;-;Garry's Mod is a game which offers a wide variety of gameplay due to its ongoing growing list of addons and mods the game has to offer. When you think you are bored of it, just go and download a bunch of addons to try out or even join the online community in a wide expanse of gamemodes to try. Just make sure you have the Counter Strike Source files from the following website: http://kajar9.wix.com/2#!downloads/chgd. Just place the map and content files in your addons folder and you'll be good to go. 10/10.
JerzachZ;-;I recommend this game to anyone who likes to play games with their friends. Gamemodes like Trouble in Terrorist Town or Prop Hunt should be played with your friends. The game has an amazing workshop with endless possibilities. 8.5/10
Orangegamer;-;Sandbox + Source Engine = Fun! Buy it now!
Master Hunter;-;Best game ever but even this isnt enough to explain how awesome it is!
Simply;-;Do you like mucking around? Do like being a d*ck to people? Do you like doing random sh*t with loads of fun and a ton of mods to download? Then this game is for you, probably one of my favourite games.. EVER!
VitaminZeth;-;Im no critic when I say get the game alright... After a total of nine hours playing the game, NUMEROUS mod testing and observations I`ve come to conclude that this game is meant for ANY type of gamer. Lots of ideal game modes, game maps, mods for extra weapons and the above. I really like how skins just make a whole diffrent experience while gaming in a new world as one of your favorite characters by Valve and etc. Lots of sick block busting weapons call out to you when subscribing to mods at the workshop. I highly recomend to check out what I am subscribed to (thanks to a little someone) and to TRY out the parkour mods. Adds realism to the already fictionized game world. This universal game gets you addicted after you finnally load that level, whether or not your online with peeps or just experimenting on your own blank canvas. I highly recomend a decent computer video card (NVIDIA if i spelt it right! Or anything that can run Fallout 3 - Elder Scrolls IV - Oblivion (Bethesda) ) and at least good internet to get a good ping. Most of my friends play Team Fortress 2, and my ping level to MVM servers or regular comunity servers is at your standard 69 -70. Not all bad, especially for Gmod, but besides some lag spikes and frozen computer screens you need to close down immediately with the task mannager, the Game is not that all a PAIN! I really like weapons and the maps, umm... Not really much to say now but to thank again those who also recomended Gmod to me, thankyou! Im just passing down the torch to one of the BEST FPS of all time! Side Notes - I may add more to this if i find more stuff out but so far besides how my PC handles it, its fine. Its worth the $9.99, but sometimes they hype down to $4.99 or one time: $1.99 on the market. But really all togethger just get the game!|
PurpleQuacker;-;Ah Garry's mod. The game with most under 14's since call of duty. Garry's mods possiblities are pretty much endless as their are tons of mods out their, and more coming everyday. This allows for good filmaking or just plain diccking around. The multiplayer is something to be wary of as there is pretty much a pre pubesent child in every server going around killing people or deleting everything your trying to create. Some servers try to restrict this by allowing no killing or deleting but this can also lead to other types of trolling like someone puting a fence over a door so no one can escape. Its pretty much a lose lose situation. Just be prepared to deal with these problems or make your own server with a passcode so you save yourself the brain tumors that are the trolls. Another problem you might face is the downloads on custom servers that will take 10 minutes and might not even work. Mind you this is only one mode of the multiplayer. As the name gives away Garry's Mod is pretty much a modders wet dream. Their are mods galore. Some of note are TTT-Trouble in Terrorist Town (best played with friends), Murder and Prop Hunt. These are game mods that add a whole new gameplay experience but you can also get mods for guns, cars, people...pretty much anything you can think of, its in the workshop. The singleplayer for Garry's Mod is pretty much for testing out your mods or just having fun with them by yourself. It allows you to set up scences or build awesome contraptions without any interference from the high balls. All in all Garry's Mod is a good experience with some friends in the multiplayer and is a good tool or filmaking and fun, the communtiy more or less is pretty cool, where you can find some pretty humorous blokes aye. I give Garry's Mod a 9/10! Just bring ear protection....
Col. BacoN;-;Garry's Mod is an essential for the creative (or destructive) mind to enjoy, In its vanilla state, GMOD provides many opportunities and tools to express your desire to create toilet submarines, or explode about 50+ NPC's with the RPG. GMOD is a hugely flexible (and sometimes unstable) sandbox when you mess around with the possibilities, including adding things like Wiremod to unlock the possibilities (or confusion) . GMOD, however, is not stand-alone, and requires a source engine game to power the experience, which shouldn't really be difficult to achieve, especially with TF2 being F2P. The game is also not only a sole experience, but an amazing multi-player world where anything can happen, which isn't always a good thing! The multi-player world is a interesting one, and some addons would be needed to avoid people messing up what you make. Maps, game-modes and infinitely more pieces of content can be added at your leisure, but performance will take a hit in most cases. As a flexible, sandbox, you would probably expect to be able to do almost anything, and GMOD pretty much does just that. For a measly few pounds or dollars, you can unlock a unique world that has almost no bounds to your creativity, which is what a sandbox is all about. Highly Recommended. Rated: 9.7/10
sunaaka;-;the most fun i have had with video games truly a game you shoud buy
William;-;The RagMorph makes you a ragdoll! (test it out in the workshop)
RadioActiveCoffee;-;This game is AWSOME!
XLightningBlueX;-;Its a good game to play when you have nothing better to do, and make your imagination run wild...
The Pan Man;-;One of the best sandboxes I've ever played. If you have never seen Garry's Mod, you're in for a ride! Tons upon tons of user-created content, guarenteed for hours and hours of gameplay. Note: HL2 and CS:S are VITAL for playing this game. Without the two, this game turns into an error-box simulator.
UnpeeledBanana;-;I have almost 800 hours on this game. I think you know what my review is.
BestDkNA;-;This game is a MUST have. There is so many things you can do in it and it never gets old. BUY THIS NOW!
Herowertyer;-;Fun enough game. All the gamemodes are worth it, you just have to buy another game for the best ones to work. But all in all, it is action packed with destruction and fun!
Rhino The gamer;-;Very fun game top 10 :)
Ice Cube;-;This game is a cool game and is one of my favorite cause u can do anything u want in the game and there is no goal whats so ever so i think this is my 2nd favorite game
Pingypoker;-;game of the century
Finny Malay;-;Hilarious fun with unlimited potential, you can do anything.
Siether;-;Great game with endless possibilities!
[BA] Baron von Haxor;-;This is one of my favourite games out there. I've always like garry's mod because facepunch studios made the game in such a way so it would be very easy for people to mod and create addons for. The community are constantly creating addons for this game so it's hard to become bored. I've always said that garry's mod is really good because its the kind of game that you could re-create any other game in with some time and effort. I would reccomend that people buy this because of the low price and the hours of fun that can be had.
DoubtfulHen754;-;gr8 b8 m8 cant even h8 so I r8 8 outta 8
Brincksmadness;-;you shouldnt just make it so you have to buy a game so yo dont have errors and pink stuff

saargreen2000;-;awesome game you can do literaly anytihing
Der Nuclear Catzen;-;I spent 4 hours straight killing people by shooting watermelons at them and then crashed the game by shooting to many watermelons. 10/10 watermelons
Lieutennant Fluffy Ears;-;I couldn't poosibly think of another sandbox game I playerd for ovrt 1000 hours on except for minecraft. Let me just say, this game is ESSENTIAL to your library just to screw around with. If you like the source engine or Half Life 2, You'll like it.
MSsPkC;-;One of the best games i ever got on steam endless hours of fun!
George W. Bush did 7/11;-;Better than Sex.
Ruffles;-;i dont knoe hoe to use the addons for this

Birdy;-;Brilliant game
Sam;-;I have to review something for the Pillar of Community badge, so I'm doing this. also, garry's mod is good.
John McChicken;-;As a player for around 23 hours of playing at the time of this post, I would so far recommend this video game to those in possetion of at least a decent computer. I suffer from a few crashes here and there, although, on the other hand, I have a lot of enjoyment before they take place. The gamemodes are interesting, the gameplay varies from them, there are tonnes of maps to play on and a whole community for you to share this fun with! Rated 4/5.
Ivan Ivanoskonov Ivany Ivanovich;-;Very good game. Flexible, fun, and simple enough to settle down in a special community that you might stumble upon in the game. It might seem bare at first, but that is where the "Mod" comes in. It lets you swap and add in new things for you to toy with, and the modding community seems to have no end in creating wonderful ideas to play around in.
[Hans];-;I bought this game to play Prop Hunt, but I became addicted to Trouble In Terrorist Town. The communities are fantastic, on the whole, and they make you feel welcome. All in all, a great online multiplayer experience. Counter Strike Source is recommended too, for extra textures and content. I have yet to play with the actual Sandbox properly, but I will leave that to the pros. I am having too much fun with what's already out there.
Skygliderjack;-;THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER! YOU MUST GET IT NOW!
Lep;-;Garry's mod is a must have, i dont care who you are. Best sandbox out there without a doubt. Even my mom played it and she found it fun.
Demo;-;I LOVE THIS GAME. I mostly play for the Trouble in Terrorist Town, but I do play the single player and build , y'know, the usual.
Corrine;-;You can do everything you ever imagined with this game. Buy it, Play it, Win it. 8D
KatarnTheOutcast;-;Great game, very fun even if you're bad at it

Riptor820;-;This is a good game, you should buy it.
Zafkiel;-;Simple and easy to learn, but has advance options as well
JSW12;-;If you are planning to purchase or recieve this game, then you should kiss the next few years of your life away! In Garry's Mod, you can pretty much do whatever you want! There are tons of mini games such as Trouble In Terrorist Town, Murder, etc. Garry's Mod is hands down the best sandbox game I have EVER played! At first, I didn't think this would be a game for me. When I discovered that you could download content on about anything and play tons of mini games, I fell in love with this game! This game is totally worth the $10. I promise you that you will not be bored when you get this game!
Lomas;-;Matt Spencer's a coon.

defiaN #S;-;THIS GAME IS FUN! I recomend it for people that who likes to pose,build,making pictures and more! When you want to build anything its a little bit hard but you can learn yourself or ask your friends. THIS GAME IS FUN AGIAN!
Swaggety Ann;-;Garry's mod has provided my friends and I countless hours of fun. You can find many creative mods for the game, and as no goals are set in sandbox the sky is the limit allowing creativity unrivaled by most. If you have the funds, and don't already own it I highly suggest buying Garry's mod. Not Day one garry's incident which by no means should you even mention.
Arkangel Vigilamus;-;1787 hours spent on this game, 10/10 would play 2000 more hours.
Vadkatana;-;80% of server owners are 12 year olds who bugged their parents into submission, you can pretend to be their friend and trick them into giving you a lead admin role (takes about 1-2 hours). Use this to ban them from their own server. 86/10
Andy_mcLoL;-;Buy this game... DO IT U SON OF A NUGGET!

If you don't like one gamemode, there's plenty others to choose from. And if you don't like any of them, you always have good old sandbox where you can let your creativity and imagination run wild! :)
UltimateGam3r;-;awesome game! so much to do, endless fun!

Brown Boy;-;This game is off the chain!
Rob Schneider;-;Garry's Mod is a work of art. It helps Rob Schneider express his artistic side. By his very nature, Rob Schneider is an artist plain and simple. Although Garry's Mod has it's creative limits, Rob Schneider defintely approves of this game.

TeraVex;-;Fun as hell, not much to do in single player, but that is the only con to this game. Other than that, it's a great experience. Even on a crappy spec computer like mine.

Sav;-;Yes this game is amazing. I have 900+ hours on it, the most I have on a game I might add. I enjoy playing this with friends. Garry's mod comes with heaps of gamemodes in store like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Dark Roleplay, Death Run and Much much more. This game at the moment is $2.49 (when this was posted) the best price for any game. I suggest you buy this game.
Vomit Chef;-;I got  a couple times so far butt it's worth it.
In Need of a Fist;-;I made a dickmobile 11/10 Would bang.
BigPenguinSenior;-;This game is fun
spacev3;-;'Do I Recommend This game?' HELL YA! This Game It's AMAZING.. If You Havent Bought This. BUY IT. Here's My Description: Garry's Mod,A Sandbox Game That Defined The Greatness Of Sandbox Games. Workshop,And Using OTher valve Games (Such As HL2 And TF2) From Maps. People Create Items in the Workshop. The Game Is About As Endless As Minecraft. With Steam Worksop So -Pros Creative Defying Multiplayer Modding (Steam Workshop) Many Ways to Play not using Sandbox Mode -Negatives Laggy In Times Making A Server Isn't As Easy As They Say....
The_Architect;-;Its cool because you can do whatever you want, but if you want a storyline, this isnt for you. On the other hand... Excuse, I feel the urge to blow something up.
Shiro Queen;-;Likes -its really fun game to play with friends on :3. and u get to spawn anything! well if u download the mode :P dislike- its sometimes really glitchy ;-;
_\|/_GhostHunter99_\|/_;-;A sandbox game where you can do whatever the heck you want to do. It may seem a little cheesy at first, but it turns out its a good game with different kinds of modes to play with. 8/10 If you like fooling around and role playing, then this is the game for you.
El Padrino;-;Zombie Survival is amazing in this game.
NovusTheory;-;Garrys mod was actually one of the games that i find pretty interesting because there is a lot of stuff you can do with it such as playing servers of custom gamemodes like Stalker, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Deathrun, PropHunt. If you even want you can create your own server and gamemodes along with custom maps everything you want customized is available to you at it's source to customize. I'm sure you would definitely like this game a lot
happy;-;this game is super fun silly and the most random  can happen at any given time i suggest u get this game now
creepy_banana;-;this game is awesome,you guys should buy this game,there are a few of gamemodes,such as hunger games,ttt(Trouble In Terrorist Town)
=HSG=DJ_Drope;-;I admire Gmod couse its One of the Best sandbox Games there is ! In gmod you can do alot of fun things in multiplayer with your friends or just have rest from them by playing some fun offline maps or being creative and building whatever you like. You can play alot of cool gamemode like: 1942 RolePlay Dark RolePlay SandBox TTT Murderer Hide&Seak And More. I have 0nly good experience from this game and I think Everyone should have this one [And its super cheap!] Think of this You buy Minecraft for 20$ and all you get is some multiplayer with no voice chat and simple building an surviving its fun but its not the cool exeperience you will get from Gmod where you can Voice chat / RolePlay /Survive zombie apocalipses / Murder some folks / Have a pirate war / Build a pirate ship / Build ... I Could continue all Day just writing down this list. Also there is a workshop feature to this game and it supports all ''Valve'' Games ! You will need Conter-Strike source to get the full experience from the game but you can allways use workshop to fix this by downloading css content packs ! In overall I think this game is Amazing and everyone should have it and it would be the perfect present from some gamers !
Asphodel;-;Creativity..
Carl Boardbox;-;Funny,random and many games in one cheap package :D
UPS;-;I honestly can't recomend this game enough. For the amount of time I have put into this game, it really has given me so much more back.

Hypermonkey5 [53 days];-;Garrys Mod is one of the best games/mods i have ever played, I have met tons of friends on it, I have made money from hosting my own servers on it and it is full of endless oppertunity. Buy it!

Vintov;-;The game is GREAT! especially with friends it makes it all the better. Pros: - Many gamemodes to play online (Prophunt, Murder, TTT, and many more!) - Great community workshop that has many mods from your favorite games - Easy menu with a search bar for your props and such - Very cheap for the price, especially on sales (2.49 - 4.99) - Can build anything you want and adjust their physics - Face Posing and Noclip!! Cons - Doesn't come with required textures from CS for some gamemodes like Prophunt (though you can find them online) - Sometimes crashes such as freezes or just closes the whole game out while loading in servers or changing maps You definitely get what you pay for and I have had a lot of fun with this game :D
Kum Blowme;-;Perfect game that has polite and helpful community
Nukes | Terraria anyone?;-;Great game garry. It's perfect for the people who LOVE to crash all the time, Spend ages setting up a server and people who like to argue all the time!

tuxedo!;-;its a fun game to keep you going just imagin and bulid
Lone Wanderer <(");-;Garry's Mod's a pretty good game. Lot's of things to do, and I do mean LOT'S. There's always new content in the forms of addons and even new gamemodes (different unique games that differ from the base sandbox entirely), and thousands of different servers to try them all out on. Some people say it's a dieing game, but it's growing everyday, and new things just seem to show up weekly.
Bonnie MTD;-;My most favourite game GET IT
Rich Homie Vinyl Scratch;-;This is possibly the most modded open world game it is, after awhile it gets boring but when your new to it you got a world to explore so get to it

The Freezer 2;-;Naked man took my child. 11/10
WaffleGamez;-;Its one of the best games i have ever played even without addons but with them you can do anything
Totally Not Insane [Chat];-;This is possibly one of THE most creative yet destructive games I have ever played. When it comes to multiplayer, you and your friends can do anything! From taking on a horde of combine soldiers, to leisurely relaxing and building something of your imagination. BUT! This game does not only have sandbox mode, it has plenty of others, all of which are very exciting. Trouble in Terrorist Town is a game where you use your wits, skills, or your weapon to kill the traitor or the innocents. Prop hunt is personally my favorite in Garry's mod, you can disguise yourself as a prop in the map, and the "hunters" will have to find you. But be careful, you only have 30-25 seconds to hide. There are plenty of other things to do in Garry's mod, but I am afraid if I list them all, I can waste your time explaining it to you when you can be playing it! Consider getting Garry's mod. -Alucard Hellsing approves of this game and message-
dRAGZ-;-;Really fun game modes such as TTT and Prophunt
Re-Kleiner;-;One of THE BEST multiplayer games of all time, although if you want play this game- youre going to have to spend your life.
Erik | DDPAT;-;So many possibilities, but not enough time :( I LOVE IT! You can do anything, duel with friends, replay hl2 with custom weps or TTT, prop hunt, INFINITE FUN!
My Name Is Jeff;-;i've got it and um, IT'S pretty awsome. but now it get's awsomer. with the addons and the new garry's mod. THUMBS UP
Pink Guy;-;Made Link and Master Chief fight to the death 10/10
Gonzano;-;If you are gonna buy this game then be ready to have so much fun with crazines  stuff bad screenshots and funny shitz and gigglez
RoDogs;-;This is the best game since sliced bread... ;D
MyUserName;-;one of the best games ive ever played with friends
Refrigeraptor;-;Better than sex and friends
[TAW] Gaben Ewell;-;you can spawn naked chicks. 15 breasts/15
CarsonButt #EllyBelly;-;Garry's Mod is pretty great. I've used it for school projects a couple times, although I don't recommend this for people who are doing a serious project. Lots o' ways to use it, and always hilarious. :)
Hardstyle;-;Garry's Mod, Published by QuickScope Studios, is an RPG, FPS game. You play as John Hardwood, a man travelled back in time by his physics teacher to face his greatest enemy, 'Faze Clan'. You journey through endless maps, ranging from an open jungle - to a snow mountain. The story is set in a western theme, with cowboys and indians chasing you through the landscape. The Qui2CkScope Engine runs this game very nicely, with clean, hardcore 3D polygon models for a bit of eye candy while playing only makes the game that much better. The real gameplay flys in when you reach the alpha stage - also known as the Trickshot 420 Stage. The stage involves you trying to hit a 750 noscope double tap yy to semtex cancel 420 snoop lion blaze shot, when there standing infront of you, Faze Clan. The ending was quite thought out and well done, with you finally taking the last hit and teabagging the Faze clan. Overall a must have for any hardcore noscopers out there! - 10/10
Thing;-;Very fun game for alone making stuff or letting bots fighting eachother. But also very very fun with friends on server I recommend playing with 2 other friends a Dark RP server and making your own base I had allot of fun but only if those 11 year old admins would be a little smarter it would be more fun!
Lazermaniac;-;It's a physics sandbox where you can build a car out of a vending machine and some trashcans. If you have ten bucks to spare and already own a Source game, you owe it to yourself to try this out.
Matches;-;Make and do anything you want,no excuses for not liking this game.
Canned BREAD;-;Garry's Mod. whats not to like about it? It is literally a game in which you play games and do whatever the hell you want! I have nothing bad to say about this game at all. Im writing this review to tell you that if you dont have it get it and if you were to only get one game i would totally recommend Garry's Mod. Im not going to list the pros because it would take forever. But for those of you who do have it i know you agree with me when i say this game is totally worth the ten dollars spent on the game. I rate this game 11/10
PsychicBeetle;-;I can't stop playing!
{SuN} BitBananna;-;Put thrusters on the back of a chair and it sent me to space 10/10
Testosterone;-;Most certainly a must-own title for any casual PC gamer or Steam user. Definitely a classic indie game among many others. This game can easily provide hours of entertainment to those of nearly all ages with or without friends!
[MoDz] \_ABLAZED_/];-;This game is cool and funny. I play it everyday.You can play with your friends,killing, and having fun. I recommend you to buy this game, but in order to play this game you need to get Valve games. If you bought it already, ENJOY!
Bamarin [IT];-;If you like The Orange Box you will love this game... wait i said this game? I meant those mods. Infact buying this game you'll be able to play tons of games. You'll never be bored, and you can't even try all the mods because there're too many! The most important thing is that this is NOT only a game with Gmod you can also make amazing videos using as characters your favourites from TF2, Portal, L4D and everything else just downloading them from the workshop!
{BB}-Cpt***ken kaneki***l||E||l;-;Great game loads of fun with friends cant get enough
St3oR | Mephisto;-;Awesome game nice mods fun. Such WoW.
hi im Vibbe;-;a fun game with alot of gamemodes
Generic_Blog;-;The only problem with this game is that the majority of servers rely heavily on CS:S content, so if you don't buy the CS:S bundle, you have to limit the amount of servers you can play on.
G33kIsMe;-;Love this game it has to be the best sandbox mod game on steam. MAYBE THE BEST GAME.

{}Inderpminus Rex;-;Game is fun! You get to do anything that you want to! But paying more money to get rid of pink and black squares is not fun. 8/10
SoldierJ115;-;It's basically everything you could possibly want in a game. For $10. Just make sure you buy the CS:S + Garry's Mod Bundle to get them both at a discount (since Counter-Strike: Source is required for most things). Also get Half-Life 2 and the Episodes, because those are required for a lot of stuff too. Anyways, buy it as soon as you can. Or wait till it goes on sale for $4 during one of the Steam sales (but that's basically highway robbery). Either way, well worth the money. This game has nearly everything you could think of on its workshop, not to mention various other sites where you can find even more addons. My only complaint is that this game is somewhat poorly optimized for Macs (imagine waiting 1 hour to get into a normal server and then crashing upon loading in). And my Mac works fine with every other Source game I own, with super quick loading speeds and everything, so it's a problem on the game's end. Fortunately, there are some things you can do to make it run faster, like verifying the integrity of the game cache and uninstalling and fully deleting old addons. Anyways, 9/10.
Johnny 2x420;-;I loved this game eveer since the early versions were out. Now that you can add in creations and do a whole lot more stuff in Gmod, it's one giant mess of awesome.
ZeusMeus;-;this game's awesome and hilarious xDD
AGC | Neff's Lady;-;Garry's Mod is so much fun! I play it everyday lol It is my go to game.
-==- xB4|\|\3/_$M4$H3|\x -==-;-;Play this game once, and your thirsty for more. Play this game twice, and you want to try more. Play this game thrice, and use the rest of your life playing this one game.* *Warning only for people who are sad enough not to go outside OR people who want to try every single gamemode, mod, weapon, NPC, Player Model, Script, blah, blah, blah, blah. This game is more about finding your fun with friends or in a community of a gamemode or a server, than spending most of your time playing alone. And then there is the programming side, map making, server hosting and admining etc etc. Go play it, go enjoy it. Find your fun.
Steve Da Panda;-;This game is like Pancakes its delicous
Analcrabs;-;Shrek is love, Shrek is life
pokemon;-;Ever had a good imagination? Then this game is for you! In this game, you can do everything you want. :3 Go get this game now! Or else Painis Cupcake will come and eat you. :)
frostbitetjones;-;Garry's mod is a great game about creativity and roleplay. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes games.
CirmelAcade;-;this game is so good and only at 10 to 20 punds you cant go wrong
Entebbe;-;Honestly this game is a must have if you would call yourself a PC player over a console player. It is just a game everyone has as it is... well... Garry's Mod! It continues to always be updated with new gamemods and items, and there is a ton of variety on the several hundreds of servers per gamemod. I don't like saying something is a "MUST BUY" because it just seems cheasy and fake, but honestly I would find it surprising to find a single person who playes on this platform that dosen't have Garry's Mod. If you want any cons the only ones I could think of is the dumb way the originized server browsing where servers are constantly jumping around. I suppose maybe the graphics is another con, but honestly no one plays this for graphics. They play this for the originality.
Pasta J;-;Garry's BOD, more like. Damn this game turns me on.
Excellent Name;-;fun, but only in a pinch, wouldnt reccommend playing it 8 hours a day, every day like SOME people
BAXTER;-;Beacuse it is awesome
ImTwoBasic;-;Very neat and great game for creative thinkers and people who are interesting in building and the fact that you get to put ragdolls in a position to make it look like there ing each other so all in all great game and 10/10 P.S it crashes a lot oon mac///like i mean a LOT
Yellow #roadtosilver3;-;Fun, get creative!, Kill Headhugger and meat boys, and get trouble in terroist town.
Ori;-;Garry's Mod is peremptorily the biggest sandbox ever made. You can either use it to create "scenes" with characters from different worlds (like Gordon Freeman meeting Pyro) and also download many addons created by people around the world or play on many gamemodes. One of the most popular are Prop Hunt (Hide n Seek) or Trouble in Terrorist Town. [+] Many gamemodes [+] You can play games or play sandbox creating a scene [+] Billions of addons downloadable from in-game menu or just from Steam workshop. [+] Addons are like models You can use to scenes, character modesl (how You looks like), weapons, different maps and also gamemodes but it's not everything. There is maaaany many others things You can use just with few clicks. Just search and click "subsrcibe" or "download". [+] This game is fully customizable. You want to have that weapon - just download it. You don't want to have? Don't download! It's easy - You add what You really want and need :) [+] Compatibile with CS: Source, HL2 and TF2 games [-] You won't be creating great thing like on YouTube GMod's videos just from the beginning - You have to learn the settings etc. This game isn't ideal but I think it's great!
Cypher;-;This is pretty much fun. I can build anything i can do. The Best server is prophunt! I really enjoy this game.
Spy z Backstab #Valar Morghulis;-;It is wonderfull .
chiken;-;This game is great. You can set up your own little world where you can do whatever your heart desires. Make a companion that follows you. Create an army of crows that you can crush. Make a giant fortress that not even the Hulk himself could smash! ...Or make a giant flying  that shoots .
BANG;-;Pretty alright
Salami Tsunami;-;This game shows the fact that creativity is must for all games these days. The pure ability to let your mind run free in this game makes it a 10/10 for me because it is so great. Except for trying out a plugin and I need Half life 2 or CS:GO but it is still a great game
Snort Cannon;-;Garrys mod is a game where you can do any thing up to youre imagination. Garrys mod is a sandbox game where you can spawn charecters from youre favourite Valve games or diffrent games in general. You can build stuff and do stuff if youre bored. Apart of the awesome singelplayer theres also an Multiplayer mode thats even more awesome. It adds awesome modes like Trouble in terrorist town, Prop Hunt, Slender, Murderer and tons more to name. There are some minor things. First of all this game has a steep learning curve you will have to learn the hard way and then of course the infamous texture problems which some times annoys the living hell out of me. But overall the game is amazing and if you dont own it by now buy it immiadetly. I give Garrys Mod a 9/10
(   ) CROpunisher!;-;THIS GAME IS ING AWESOME BEST GAME ON STEAM ITS AN MUST HAVE!
[PhG] DarkLord;-;Amazing. I cant stop playing. I swear this comes before my work. So many games and new people to meet. A good buy!
lM[xzW];-;this game is gg m8
SuperMcAwesome;-;I found myself putting in hundreds of hours in this masterpeice of a game, there is so much stuff to do it will be near impossible to get bored, from making buildings, to playing on a WIDE veritiy of servers this game beats it all, this is TRULY the ultimate sandbox!!!!!!
s14yer369;-;overall a good game
Xx_Dank420m8_xX;-;The game is awesome! I've been playing it since its was Garry's mod 9/10. Anyway it was boring back then, but now that there were added a lot of gamemodes like Dark RP(srry that one was available back then), Trouble in Terrorist town, Murder, Prop hunt, ELEVATOR SOURCE(THE MOST EPIC ONE OF ALL), Battlefield Of Duty, etc. Overall the game is awesome and for the low price of $7.99 i recommend it for you to buy! See ya ingame! :P
pixelice;-;A must have game!
Marko[MKD];-;Garry's Mod is a sandbox game. You have a wide variety of props from various Source games (depending on which you own), and multiple tools at your disposal. With these, you can build different contraptions, make vehicles, construct buildings, etc. As well as all the content included in the game, you can find a ton of mods online via the game's website or Steam Workshop. You can also make/script your own. But the fun doesn't stop there. Multiplayer is a totally different thing entirely. You can find sandbox servers and build with up to hundreds of other players, or you could dive into one of the many user created game modes. From Hide and Seek to Role Playing, there is a huge variety of unique modes to play. A few I would recommend are: Trouble in Terrorist Town. A group of 'innocent' terrorists must work with the detective(s) to discover who the traitors are and kill them. The traitors must take out the innocents, preferably without alerting anyone else. No one knows who is innocent and who is not, making for a sometimes tense experience. Morbus. A group of humans must hold out for a certain amount of time against aliens, or kill them all. There are two types of aliens: Brood aliens, and Swarm aliens. The Brood aliens get upgrades, and can transform into humans. Allowing them to get into groups and pick off people one by one. The Swarm aliens are what players spawn as when they die (assuming they were killed by another Swarm alien, or human). These have a melee and ranged attack, but no upgrades. Their role is to weaken the humans, and try to kill them. The humans have needs. Every now and then you will have to either sleep, eat, shower, or pee. You cannot move during this time, so must be wary of those around you, in case they are brood aliens. Overall one of the best game modes. A ton of fun, especially with friends. DarkRP. DarkRP is one of the more casual RP modes in Gmod. You spawn into the map as a citizen, and can choose a job to play as. From drug dealers to civil protection, there is a wide variety of roles to pick. You can go around earning money, commit crimes, buy and furnish your own house, etc. Great if you find the more serious RP servers to be boring. Overall the game is absolutely brilliant. One of the very few that I can keep going back to and not get bored. I purchased the game around 2-3 days ago for 1.99euro, and have since put almost 24 hours into it. One of the best purchases I have ever made.
Animlizerus;-;This game is really fun and has lots of cool game modes. Worth paying!
de_dick;-;Its a great game, there's so much to do and you'll never get bored. Its pretty cheap too, so its amazing for its price. There's hours of content in the workshop and already in-game content that can have you hooked for hours. There are many game modes to try out and you'll just fall in love with one of the game modes. Some of these game modes just never get boring, kinda weird actually..but awesome at the same time! This game is waaayyy more fun playing with friends, but its just as great messing around in sandbox by yourself. If you like to experiment and mess around. Definitely try out sandbox first, there's loads of workshop content and in-game content to mess around with as i said before. Even if you don't like that sort of stuff, there's still some fun and exciting game-modes to play, such as TTT and Prop hunt. Its a must buy, and you dont have a reason not too. Its cheap, fun and exciting! I hope you guys come to your senses and buy this game since its probably one of the best games on steam. 10/10
2 Sexy 4 U 2 Handle #Taken;-;This game is only good when your playing on the VGN Servers XD
Tim The Wizard;-;sooo much to do in this game!!
dickkickem.v2 <memeware.net>;-;This game is a great physics-sandbox game made by the mind of the intellectual Garry Newman. Here's some things that you should know. To start off as a noob at this game, it doesn't look like much. It's just a bunch of props on a menu. But WAIT. There's this thing called the Steam Workshop where you can download all kinds of awesome crap. 100 or more mods + GMOD = One of the best games of all time. You can seriously have a lot of fun in this game. You can mess around with ragdoll people and do whatever what comes in your mind to them. There is also NPCs. They're EXTREMELY fun to mess around with, but don't mess with the wrong ones *cough* Metro Police *cough.* If you find some gibs on the Steam Store, get it. It will add an extra-gory mess to your ragdolls and NPCs, which makes it 100x more fun. Three great maps for first-timers are gm_apartmentcomplex, Freespace 13, and gm_tornadovillage. In gm_apartmentcomplex, you can just go running around in a realistic apartment, either robbing people or causing a massive siege with NPCs. The only downside to it is that the map is relatively small, and you can't really drive or fly that much. In Freespace 13, the name says it all. In gm_tornadovillage, it is just OUT OF THIS WORLD fun. It has a large open map, and not only can you commit drive-bys and blast away destructible homes, you can chase tornadoes while you are at it with the cars add-on SCars. I guarantee you, it will provide you hours of fun, but you need a somewhat good computer to play it, otherwise there will be LOTS of lag. Three great add-ons for first timers are M9K weapons, SGMcars/TDMcars, and SCars. The M9K weapons are your basic weapons. However, if you get all the packs, you can have the ultimate server battle or the ultimate standoff with the Metro Police! With the SGMcars/TDMcars, you will be AMAZED at what these guys did! The cars have the ultimate graphics, and basically, they're from the same engine source. However, they are not good with the tornado maps because they have a LOT of weight on them. Last but not least, there is the SCars. They are cool, reliable, and fast. They are perfect for any medium-sized to large-sized map, if it is roam-able. They are the PERFECT add-on if you want to be a GMOD Tornado Chaser. Unfortuantely, they are a tad too light, so it will be easy for a GMOD tornado to pick up your car. Otherwise, the SCars are the way to go. In conclusion, this game has endless possibilities. This game is perfect for anyone, and in MY opinion, I think EVERYONE should get it. If you don't get it, you're missing out BIG TIME. So fork out only $9, and go and play one of the most critically acclaimed Indie games of ALL TIME. Believe me, you'll be glued to this game every day! 9.8/10, 97/100
Evoldo;-;Garys Mod is such a great game that I can't even emphasize enough on how much I enjoy this game! Everytime there is something completely new and fun to do, you can join multiplayer servers, which is a blast! Or you could also host your own GarysMod server for free, like a do. You can install hundreds of thousands of mods for this game, no joke, or you can make your own with a little time! If I had to give this game a rating I would give it a solid 10/10 for sure. I think i found the love of my life!
Nia Teppelin;-;In this game you will have a lot of random moments ... actualy this is the most random game ever ... TONS OF GAMEMODES ( getting cs s content pack or buying the game is recomanded ... improves gameplay) its a game that i have a lot of fun
Tuba;-;This game is so fun. The amount of mods and maps for it is just so huge, it's infinitely playable. Wanna sell drugs and avoid getting caught? There's a gamemode for that. Wanna try out an obsticle-course like game where the track is controlled by a player? There's a gamemode for that. Wanna sit in a movie theater and watch YouTube videos with your friends in first person. There's a fricking gamemode for that. This game is worth every penny. 10/10
Mild Autism;-;this game is like lamp. i love lamp
Padyda;-;It's fun
LOYZ3;-;100 games in 1. Lots of fun playing specially with friends. You get to meet lots of people too. I def recommend it.
Krazy Kranky;-;Greatest autism simulator I have ever played.
Hazzy;-;The one game that I've spent over one thousand hours on. You can do ANYTHING in this game, all it takes is a bit of creativity and imagination. This mod has something for everyone, whether you're into roleplaying, building, surviving waves of zombies or even trolling... BUY IT NOW! There's nothing to lose, and you'll never regret it.
[MNI] IceCreamJimmies;-;Garry's Mod is a very cost efficient game! It's one game with a whole bunch of games within it! It's a great game to play with your friends and have a great time with!
Thomas The Dank Engine;-;10/10 makes me want to turn into a lesbian and do meth
rawj1213;-;Just plain goofy fun with friends. Hate having so many missing textures though and having to own all the source engine games to fix it. Wish they would make a standalone of this. Would be great in my opinion.
SuperLlama57;-;so awesome!!!!!! i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
McCook;-;I bought It and I didn't even know about how fun the MulitPlayer is. Amazing game and the servers are so much fun. Hard to get started in the sence of being able to make cool things. So much fun and addicting. I got it after I had so much fun in rust. I haven't played Rust for 2 days after getting this game.
Mamsy;-;This game is basically community drivin, you can hours of fun in the sandbox mode or if build and glitching the game out isnt your type it "find multiplayer game" and see a variety of gamemodes appear before your eyes (much more than COD ever had) and most of them are a great blast with a laugh or two. WARNING: this game does need Hl2 and Counter Strike: Source (Not Global Offensive) and you may just want to download the texture files from the internet but these are very fun games and also worth the price of admission (Even if they are old)
MaschiiN;-;Very fun game with many different maps and gamemodes. It's a cheap game too! You can even earn Gary Mods trading cards.
Wosic;-;What is good with this game is that you never get bored of it. It is always something to do. You can play sandbox and build you own things or you can spawn things that other players have made. You can do absolutely what you want. It is also a big selection of game modes you can play like Trouble in Terrorist Town, PropHunt, Stop it Slender and many other game modes that players make. Something that is kind of bad with this game is that you need other Valve games like Counter-Strike: Source if you shall play Trouble in Terrorist town and some other game modes. And if you are inn sandbox you get a much larger variety of things you can spawn if you have other Valve games. And if you spawn things that other players have made it comes a big errors because they use objects from different Valve games. For me it was also hard to learn how to do things in this game, first time I played it I didn't have a clue how to do things and just joined random servers. But after a while I figured how to do things in this game. (Now it is alot of guides to Gmod you can read but it wasn't that when i started playing it so now it is easier) I really recommend this game to everyone since it is so much different things you can do, if you get it you will probaly play it alot (like me) and I recommend that you play with some friends it's just so much fun with friends. I will give it 9/10 (Because it is hard to figure everything out)
Based Skeletor;-;Very good game, bit erish at times but still good. It just shows behind every black man, is a ragdoll trying to be set free <3
Buck Tooth Billy;-;Great game. So much fun.
Pouya;-;Very fun game, you can honestly do anything.
Aquila;-;What else is there to say other than this is my number one personal favorite.
Soniea;-;I would highly reccomend this game if you seek for fun and have 'friends'. It's not an ordinary shooting fps game like cs, or smth, so I don't reccomend this game for ragers and russians (sorry no offense)
flare;-;It's a billion games in one. Goes on sale frequently, it'll be the best 5 bucks you'll ever spend.
Birthday-Boy lsnana;-;You can pretty much shove everything into this game.
Mini-Strekki @allied-gamers.com;-;Probally one of the best and most unique games i've ever played.
Faded x Sunday;-;this game is so good, it makes me cry
[LP] Trippy;-;This is just an all around game made for everyone.
Ethon;-;This game is so hilarious that it hurts.
Psycho.O;-;You can destroy watermelons 10/10
Fb||Rabbid;-;Garry's Mod is a great game. You can download many gamemodes for it so you can do things like roleplay, trouble in terrorist town, etc. Or you can just play in sandbox mode. The graphics are realistic. I would rate this game as a 10 out of 10.
100% Ant;-;Awesome game and it gives you so much freedom to do whatever you want to do!!! If your a person who likes freedom in games then this is the game for you!!! But it you won't regret it and it's at a low price. So really you getting a great game which gives you a ton of choices to choose from and have tons of fun all for a low price!!!
CoNPleX;-;not played it that much cant judge it yet
Lil' Poot;-;I recommend this game it is my favorite game ever on steam. It has Workshop items custom gamemodes Etc. You should get this game if you have'ent already. This was also what started my steam account! Epic game!
[40-1] SexyZarsu;-;I love how you can do almost anything in it and its fun as
Logan M. Schrdinger's Cat;-;How can you review Garrys mod theres so much stuff for every kind of player It has so many gamemode and so many servers and is SO MUCH FUN Buy it if you dont have it already (but who does not?)
Lars $oRich;-;Gmod is one of those games that'll entertain the player for a long time. With an infinite amount of things to do, it never gets boring. The community is what makes the game fun though. Fan-Created Mods and Maps provide unlimited amounts of things to do. Plus the gamemodes inside of Gmod, such as TTT or Prop Hunt, also provide some fun things to do. Overall, I would rate this game 10/10 because it's one of the funnest games I've ever played with friends, and it still keeps getting better because of the fans.
BiteTheBlade;-;Garrys Mod is a open sandbox game,you can practicaly do anything you want.Its tons of fun,and for a cheap price! I recomend this game to people who like sandboxs games and even the people who dont
xXx_NativeBus_xXx;-;Garry's mod is an awsome game , it is fun , creative and you can play multiplayer with your frineds or on a server .If i needed to rate this game to 20/ i would put 20/20 you should buy it.Have fun
Acerius;-;Acerius Review - Garry's Mod What can I say? Garry's Mod is probably my most favourite game of all time due to the extended variety of gamemodes included. Multiplayer is bundles of fun no matter what gamemode you play and it's a haven for programmers. Home to a wide palette of different audiences such as roleplayers, FPS gamers and so forth Garry's Mod is most definitely a great community to be a part of. The only issue with Garry's Mod is that it's still rather buggy in some respects but nonetheless it's exceptional. Recommended game! Gameplay: 5/5 Graphics: 4.5/5 Community: 5/5 Singularity: 5/5 Quality: 3.5/5 Overall score: 23/25
black;-;Garry's mod is the best game i played so far .. there is no goal on the game but you can make anything .. you can have fun with friends on such many mods for example :p love it so farrr !!
i luv this gam;-;Buy it. Now. 10/10
Skyms2663;-;Have been playing this game since it was first released. Absolutely worth every cent.
SamiGDaBoss;-;You can spawn watermelons. 10/10 SamiG :3
bigusdicus (FernieFresh/Leon);-;Surprisingly great. Amazing game. It's a great sandbox game one of the best for sure easily ties with Minecraft at the very least. YOu would have to be stupid not to give it a try. The mods are great and reliable workshop items as well. Anything can happen in this game literally.
GodOfSandvich;-;This is actually a pretty good game. You can mess around with random objects on random game maps, or even play some Prop Hunt or Trouble In Terrorist Town. :) But to load the maps correctly, you're gonna need some source engine games such as: TF2, L4D2, HL2, CS:S, and Portal (most importantly CS:S) in order to play Prop Hunt or other mods or you'll have errors around the whole map (you can still play tho). In sandbox mode (messing around with items), you can always load the map. 8/10
The215;-;What is a "Life"?
My Name is Secret :3;-;Really Fun, Reliable Sandbox. The different mods you can add on to this game makes the game loads more fun. Also Gamemodes like Trouble In Terroist Town, Prop Hunt and many others makes the game what it is. The freedom you have on this game also makes it surprising fun and lets you have a great time with friends. I would suggest this game for anyone with and gaming ability! Definatly worth the price too!!! Enjoy :) xx
Ziox;-;I would highly recommend this game especially for only 5.99 you can't go wrong the best thing with garrys mod is that you can do so much. You can do practically anything you want and the games modding community is awesome and there is hours upon hours of fun in this game just on its own with things like trouble in terrorist town but with mods there are even more hours of content one of my favourite games. There are only a few downsides the game sometimes crashes but not too often and im using alot of mods so thats probably to be expected and although the graphics aren't anything amazing its on the source engine so most PCs can get a decent fps on this game. I would give this a 9/10
Fb||Someguy;-;U can do whatever u want. Totally epic, buy it.
Ace;-;It's almost 2014. If you don't have garry's mod yet, you should just quit.
Carlos;-;Simmply the best game to build and just have a good time
Al;-;Probably one of the best Sandbox games out there, Garry's Mod is unique like no other. With tons of gamemodes, addons, and other content, Garry's Mod is a name I will remember for a while. (Just remember, if something doesn't work, blame Gawwy.)
[RFAI] Draconian Overlord;-;A must have for those who just need something they can make by themself, so they can make an epic battle the way they want it, or make a weird contraption. Make a picture of a Rebel Vs. Combine fight, or make a picture that will make anyone go "WTF LOL!". The best part? if you get bored with what gMod has to provide, vist the workshop and get some new addons for endless entertainment, because there is an addon for everything. If you get bored making things by youself, play with friends, or enjoy one of the many multiplayer gamemodes gMod has to offer. The possiblities are endless, and thats why I give gMod a 10/10 rating. It's worth it.
Oscar Alex The 24th;-;Ah, the amazing land of gmod, where the people do what they want to do. The sky is the limits and nothing can stop you. there are a bunch of interactive gamemodes where you can play with a bunch of other interactive people. I play alot of this mostly because... Well... It's fun of course. You can never run out of fun in this game. This is such an amazing game.
Pixel;-;Very funny and addictive game! Try it!
Toxic Farts;-;so worth the $10 <3 prop hunt :)
Paws_327;-;If anyone would buy me orange box that'd be great. FUN GAME
Mega Man;-;It's sooo creative
Eddy Nolan is a NAZI.;-;One of the best sandbox games I have ever played. This game was a success when it first came out and I'm not surprised at all. The only problem is that it causes me alot of viruses on my laptop and crashes my system. Only one downside with this game, everything else is just pitch perfect. I realised a couple of days ago that it also teaches you programming when it comes to scripting. One of the best Indie games I have ever played. Thanks, Valve! Eddy Nolan
Dark One {in HELL};-;It allows you to use your imagination and test your creativity by thinking things and then trying to figure out a way to make them happen... a fun 'game' that requires a bit of mind, too ; )
a can of seductive silly string;-;This game is extremely entertaining, it's dumb. If you like games with no objective, a game that you can virtually create your own buildings/world or just killing ... It's made for you. You'll end up being stuck in the workshop at one point looking at all of the badass mods that keep coming and updating. Clicking the green subscribe button, over, and over again.... It just doesn't stop. Overall, if you love games just to do mindless stupid things, then it's a no brainer.. Get it immediately. Rating: 9/10, a must get for new steam users who want a simple game to  around in.
Nathanjm11;-;YOU CAN BUILD NUKES AND NUKE OTHER NUKES!
Turtle;-;The game is Awesome,there are too many things to do.You can make a big car or rocket ship,or just spawn too many people and killing them with any weapons from mods or usseles weapons. I Love This Game Very Much!
Wanhan;-;Great game! So much fun to just mess around with; there is so many possiblites!
Hanz the Soviet;-;It's game without limits that gives you the tools to do anything! With a great modding community and a finite number of things to do, I must definitely say this game is worth every penny!
Mikeblast;-;Best game ever, with a -ton of content, different gamemodes,addons, playtime, and addiction. And all that for 10? Just buy this.
TheBeatsGoBoom;-;Now this is the perfect game for d*cking around with stuff. If you like doing utter nonsense and wasting your life then this is the game for you.
ryandarkshadow;-;this game is nice to mess around with the addons and do what ever you want and i recommend you get this game cuz this game is fun so still give this game a 10/10 there will be haters and likers
Professor Anal Fiddler;-;I am addicted to Garry's mod, ever since I downloaded it I have never stopped playing it! I have made many new friends because of this brillaint game, I adivice getting this with Counter Strike: Source for jailbreak which is the best gamemode!
Dick Bandit;-;10/10 would play again.
PewPew187;-;11/10, It was born as Sandbox Game, and now, its grown. AS EVERYTHING!
superSuspect;-;This is the best game ever. 10/10 would .
RUN-C.M.C.;-;Probably one of the better, if not the best, games i have ever played.
Zapperator;-;Having a great time playing Garry's Mod. Enjoying the great selection of different gamemodes and the servers that people are kind of enough to set up.
TacodudarousREKT;-;This game is by far one of my favorite games. You can do so much in this, and theres so many different gamemodes you can play and so many things in this game that will always make you want to play this and stay on it longer! i recommend this game! You won't regret it!
Gecko;-;halarious game, fun and creative
drlemon;-;The only game i've ever played that manages to be EXTREMELY deep while still having the option to inflate breasts to gargantuan sizes and shoot them with bazookas. Fantastic.
Vox3000;-;All I can say is use the workshop! Addons make the game better and better!
The Graceful Monatee;-;Amazing. All the modding, support, tools, and anything else the community can think of. Anything you can think of, you can build. Loads of gamemodes, which range from Prop Hunt and TTT to the more relaxing atmosphere of Space Build (Haha, it's a pun), and are all a blast to play. This is definitely worth at least $10.
Ayylien;-;Has a Doge Ragdoll wofe/10 must buy
beasticle1199;-;I recommend this game because...um...there's not really a way to put this game or the way I feel about it in words, but it is what led me to discover Half-Live, Team Fortress, all of Valve, and Steam, and PC gaming in general. If you like sandbox, multiplayer, many gamemodes, a good laugh, like, every time you get on multiplayer, then this is no doubt the game for you. And you should just get it anyways, because I said so. So yeah, that's it.
Froman;-;every one neeeeeds this game it has too much stuff to do in it
No Wax;-;I played a few jail break modes and instantly noticed a HUGE difference in customization VS jailbreak on CS:S or CS:GO. It's ridiculous how much better it is. Not only that, but there are TONS of other custom game modes. Build a boat/flood is a good one too (other than the 2 servers that run it charging $10 for VIP, so you can use the rope tool and vote to extend the build phase, etc)... I'm just now getting into it, so I haven't discovered everything it has to offer yet, but I know it's got much more that will continue to amaze me. I'm glad I bought this.
Shadowhand;-;Be creative, play this!
ClassyJavelin;-;Let's face it, You only bought this game because Let's players like Markiplier, Pewdiepie, etc. were playing it, I have no issue with it, I just know that's why most of you want to play it, either way, this is still a fun game. Sandbox, Prop Hunt, Ultimate Chimera Hunt, Lots of things possible. I'd give it 4.9/5
Skware;-;Great game, buy it on sale though. If you can't wait, then buy it anyways. Defff worth the hours of fun and trolling.
GUFIJ1;-;this is a really cool game to just pick up and play i dont regret buying it XD
FlameFox;-;I like this game and im making this for the xp so yea buy this game
[BFF] COMMANDO SNIPER;-;this isnt a game its a world u can do what ever u want to do so
iHEX;-;This can be a fun and entertaining game when you play it with at least 2 other people but boring by yourself.
Zachary (Pablo Taco);-;Greatest sandbox game ever worth more than you pay there are millions maybe billions of addons/mods/dupes I rate this game 10.5/10
Dino Dan;-;If you don't own this game,  you
Dolan;-;Quite a good game. I've never found such an amazing game! BUY IT! IT'S AWESOME!
ASDF;-;This is a mod. U spawn watermelons. Nuff said.
IDontKnowWhatToNameMyself;-;This is the adults playground :)
Teh Neon- New acount in Profile;-;Epic Like Epicness!
Dinozzy;-;This is not a game. It's a playground. An enomous digitalize playground with several sections devoted to different type of game modes. A murder game? Check. A racing game? Check. Even a literal Role Playing game? Double Check. A playground of infinite possibilities. That's what Garry Mod is.
Ima Panda;-;A mixture of sandbox, roleplay, fighting, action, adventure, survival and tons more. Basically if your looking for a game that you will never get bored of and love to bits, I recommend this game by-far one of the best games in the universe
Deja Vu;-;Creation and destruction at your fingertips, and for the $5 that I paid for it; it's well worth it for all the time spent within Trouble In Terrorist Town (an awesome game mode unique to Garry's Mod) -- Get it, now. Why are you still reading this?
DICKENSTEIN;-;very good game 100/10 would buy again
snacks;-;Fun, creepy, just stupid, awesome, running man with tnt. And G-Man
JaM3s34o;-;This is officially the best game i have ever played in my entire life. Like legit, can't beat it with anything.
Jukebox;-;Amazing Game! Everything you need to have fun !
Ever Temple;-;Garry's Mod, or Gmod. I started playing Garry's Mod when my friends told me to try out it. After few hours of playing I'm in love with this game. You know, the huge community building and crafting different type of game modes, which allows player to use their imagination to contribute the world. It's a fun game to play, I often play Garry's Mod now instead of other games. If you're a gamer who don't know which game to go for, I definitely suggest this game to you.
Waifu #100;-;Once you find the right server, this game is really amazing. You need to keep an open mind about EVERYONE who plays this game though. I usually go for very talkative servers and a few misogynistic guys pop up but overall smaller servers seem to have the friendliest people.
Renny;-;ohmygosh this game is freaking amazing, its exactly what I've been looking for, this sandbox game has sooooo much range and all kinds of different gamemodes, definatly worth the price
Big Red Brick;-;Their is absolutely no reason not to buy this game RIGHT NOW.
DJ-Bubblez;-;A awesome game with alot of replayibility SO BUY IT.
Awkward is indeed a pleb;-;Given that I've wasted 325 hours of my life on it in the past 3 months, I think it speaks for itself.
Hoomer Simpin;-;it is awesome you should get it!!!
Rex.;-;Ruined my life. 10/10
Astrofox115;-;This is what sandbox really is. You want to build something, make it. You want to kill something, spawn it then kill it. Not that hard.
[2O2S]Rabbidrabit5;-;(Short Verison at the Bottom) I feel that this is among the greats here on steam. It has one of the most active and varied communities of any game Ive ever played, and for the most part a good community at that (if you dont like voice chat Id recommend against playing on RP servers). The game is great if you have no idea what to do due to its vast array of content both official and community made. Its also very easy to get into with clear labeling of all the tools you have at your disposal (Although it can get very complex and time consuming if you let it). Overall a amazing game for pretty much any type of gamer due to its shear amount of content (which is unmatched in my opinion by any other game on steam). Furthermore its not incredibly expensive for the base game, but BUYER BEWARE you will need all the source games in order to have the FULL experience; although its very easy to have fun with none of them or very few such as CS: Source and, TF2 (these are all you really need if you want to play online to the full experience). I personally would recommend this game to everyone I know that has ANY interest in a physics based sandbox with combat elements or just to mess around. For the price its a great game to look into, and it goes on sale often so even if you dont pick it up at full price consider getting it during a sale. SHORT REVIEW: Pro's: Good physics engine Near unlimited content (workshop) Easy to get into Great multiplayer (lots of modes) Good price for the amount of content Single player is just as good Ability to have complete freedom over what you do (Great Sandbox gameplay) Cons: (May) Have to buy additional games to have to complete experience Mic spam Poor combat model Graphics are dated in some places Resource intensive (may need a good computer) May need to download packs for servers manually Greifing is common in some multiplayer game types Little help from ingame tutorials (Lots of tutorials online)
Captain Koolaid;-;This Game Is Very Good:) .. The Game Does Not Have Lag. The Game Modes Are Very Good Habit To Pick Up haha. But I Recomend This 10/10 Get It Its Cheap And Fun. If You Do Not Get Counter Strike Source Dont Worry They Have A Website You Can Download The Missing Texters. Just Look Up YouTube Videos. I've Bought The Game And Anyway Is Fine.:) BUY IT
NONEXISTENT;-;Great game! I love it!
Crafty;-;Great Game fun to play with friends.
Taiga Fujimura;-;This game is amazing, but the only problem is that it gave me down syndrome
Plads;-;This game has the easiest mod insallation the best maps the best Npc and the best quality of any sandbox game to date i love this game every one should have it and will enjoy it
loveless;-;Garry's Mod (GM) is a virtual world developed by Linden Lab launched on June 23, 2003, and is accessible on the Internet. A free client program called the Viewer enables its users, called Residents, to interact with each other through avatars. Residents can explore, meet other residents, socialize, participate in individual and group activities, and create and trade virtual property and services with one another, or travel throughout the world (which residents refer to as "the grid"). Garry's Mod is for people aged 16 and over.
< blank >;-;My life disintegrated when I bought this game. ... 10/10.
FluffehBoo :3;-;There are no limits to this game. 10/10
BongoBoyLA;-;You can spawn watermelons.
Kiwi;-;Hours upon hours of great fun. Do whatever you want, make whatever you want. Don't like the ultimate freedom of sandbox? Play a community-made gamemode or even make your own! 10/10 would screw around for 10 hours straight again.
Mystery Man;-;it is the best sandbox game i have played it has a good community u can basicly do any thing
[Ancient] [ONI 0] Camwarp;-;Fun to Play!!! I recommend the Carters Addon Pack T.A.R.D.I.S Addon Sonic Screwdriver To play with diffrent people
ScaryTerry;-;Overall, This......... Game is phenominal, Buy CSS(Counter-Strike: Source) And it isnt need but you could get HL2(Half-Life 2) which is an equally amazing game.
Davehkiin;-;This game is the sandbox game of all games. You can make literally whatever you can imagine, with the right tools that is. There are a host of online servers with various gamemodes that you can try out, such as Deathrun, DarkRP, CityRP, Trouble in Terrorist Town. LIterally no two servers are the same! Ranging from a ton of various, custom content to try and make theirs stand out, so it's really just up to you to find one with a good community!
Balmer;-;Garry's Mod. Pretty fun game when you think about it, theres gamemodes such as TTT, RP, Darkrp, Stranded. And sandbox you can also pose ragdolls give them items such as weapons or acceories on. You can make NPc's bigger, smaller i have great times in Gmod There is a pretty great community i would defiently reccomend this :-) worth the money.
foo;-;basically HD Minecraft
Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin;-;This is one of the Greatest games i've ever played. Amazing multiplayer system. Different kinds of gamemodes. it has everithing that a player needs.... Despite the Errors in the game, It's still AMAZING! I would recommend this game to all of you Sandbox-loving gamers. If i could rate this, i would rate it 9.5/10
I'm back :D Message to play;-;I love Garrys mod so much fun makign npcs wage war in eachother
JBoyTheGreat;-;Where to even start? Garry's Mod really has to be my favorite game on Steam. Garry's Mod offers a variety of user built game modes that any player can really find anything to enjoy. You may prefer jailbreak while others prefer trouble in terrorist town or prop hunt. For player wise, you can find something that you will enjoy. For developers this game uses lua coding engine so you can make your own custom scripts for your server or for others. Garry's Mod really is an amazing game, if you don't own it, GET IT NOW!
Fem!Canada;-;this game is fun to play with friends and others or just mess around
ComfortableShooter;-;This game is awesome! You should seriously buy it.
Stevens96;-;Pretty good
flipout42;-;It says that I dont have the rigth program to run the game can anyone help me?

bpasky;-;dont really get the game... but its fun anyway
thewitness13;-;extremely addictive
ALKINDA [NO-SOUND];-;woot a customizable game. cant wait to mess around with it.
mickey;-;Wonderfull game! Compleatly and totaly recommend!
TRICKY 9LIVES;-;garry's mod is a sandbox game where there is no linear path. really there isnt anything specific you have to do, you can do whatever and the multiple game modes for multiplayer make it more then that. you can do sandbox and just build random stuff, or you can play TTT and compete to find who is going to murder everyone, or you can play jailbreak which is basically alot like jailbreak servers on counter strike. the possibilities are litterally endless, and with steam workshop support you can not only add even more extra stuff to the game, but you can even see what your friends have made too, and this game never ends at this point with so many new gamemodes, playermodels, weapons, character skins, npc's, and so much more. i definitely say garrys mod is worth the 10 dollars you pay, and is worth by CS source to use part of it which is about 25$ which i can safely say that this game is worth.
Cathnater #Proximity;-;Garry's Mod is a popular sandbox game that is played all around the world! But my favourite gamemode is Troulbe In Terrorist Town. It's a fun gamemode where it's innocent vs traitor. I highly recommend this game!
Mysterioushusky;-;this game is a lot of fun and promotes friendly activities
Rikka;-;It's Gmod *-*
Joshuacn;-;did not get it at first but now its EPIC.
skullhead51;-;Really nice sandbox with lots of replayability. Just make sure you have counter-strike: source before getting this.
Just Tooney;-;Warning: Possible effects of Garry's Mod are as follows: Addiction, Insane periods of playing time, Jumping to different gamemodes every 20 minutes, and completely impossible to avoid. Unless you or your loved ones have a life, i recommend you dont get this game... If you dont have one, BUY IT.
MYSTERY_?;-;Do you like sandbox games? Of course you do! Do you like making Gman do weird poses? Yes you do! Do like playing all kinds of different gamemodes including TTT and Prop Hunt? Hell ya! Do you like crashes and slow load times? No? Ah, well 3 out of 4 ain't bad... 8.5/10 -
[WWKF] fadedman;-;its really fun but dont overdo spawning of NPCs, vehicles, entities,etc. And to get started heres a link for a weapon addon called fire arms:source-http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=104502728
JesseM200;-;the best eva
y0_m4m4-714;-;great game
Fukboi Tweek;-;If this game was a potato, it would of been a good potato.
WonderWab;-;When you actually get it to work it is tons of fun!
WheresMySuperSuit;-;This game is pretty much like when you were in 3rd grade lunch and everyone is sitting there with their sh*tty food and you tear open your lunch bag to reveal a lunchable and all of a sudden the weight of the sun moon and earth all come crashing down on your tiny little 8 year old skull and you spontaniously combust.
Coltr1;-;This game is an amazing all-around game. Some may call it a sandbox, but not only is it limited to this title. There are some many different games and experiences to have with this game. Its even better with friends. I give this game the medal of honor when it comes to games. It is my favorite game to date.
Late Niles;-;If you like to troll, this is the game for you.
Hulsey;-;You Should Buy This Game As It Is Cheap And You Can Do Anything Would Buy Again And Have Had A Lot Of Memorable Moments
Dr.momo;-;Garrys mod is amazing! you get everything you need and do what you want. usallly the path is set but this is just where you can have fun and play to your hearts content!
Mickey Mouse;-;This game is for people who loves to use their imagination, without it, you'd be weldin' a tire to a barrel to a ragdoll, and putting thrusters on them bodies and blast off. Good game
ninjariles;-;it is so good :D i love this also has addons and you dont have to download anything to get them :D also you press the subscribe button smack dat button with your forhead
Finesse;-;Man I get betrayed, lied to, and shot everyday i play this game. 10/10
Field-Tested Mr.Nixon Doll;-;You get sent to prison when you publish a workshop item,and it reaches 1000 likes 10.5/10
full time jesus lover;-;if you dont have this game then your not living
peanutsondabeach2005;-;ttt is the only thing youre ever gonna play
The Goblin King;-;"I'm happy knowing my hypothesis of Steam users being functionally autistic is accurate." Positive highlights of my great time spent on Garry's Mod: -Getting two children banned from a DarkRP server -Killing everyone innocent and traitor in TTT without evidence and stating over the mic "I had DNA." -Killing off a HL2RP community that circlejerks over eachother with their dark and edgy characters/usernames -Dealing with admins with superiority complexes -Hearing the cries and lamentations of children as I RDM them senselessly -Building "Outer Toll Gayt Heaven" in conjunction with a fellow friend -Meeting new friends and restablishing old friendships with those who know how to have fun -Roleplaying as a white supremacist -Roleplaying as an abusive cop -Becoming a space marine and having everyone laugh at your toned upper body -Becoming a whale hunter -Learning how to be a better father Cons: -Admins -Community -Screaming children -DarkRP -Trouble in Terrorist Town -Half-Life 2 RP -Waiting two months to join a server -Bronies -Furries -Stoners -Youtube celebrities turning this game into more of a daycare -Friends becoming addicted to Garry's Mod 5/10. It's okay. The community and lack of new gamemodes really make this unreplayable after a while.
SillyLittleGoose!;-;What can i say about garrys mod? Well it's the kind of game that you find yourself putting in countless hours of your life into. This game is very fun but if you wish to play multiplayer like TTT, or prophunt you also need other games like Counter Strike: Source, Portal , and Half Life to get all of the textures to play. So if your wondering about buying it you should i give this game a 10/10 by far.
JeffBrah;-;This Game Is Just Simply Amazing. Creative And Fun! Best Game to play with your mates
Ryasberry';-;Taught me Haw 2 Physx. Dan Outta Dan
{SK}GameGod311;-;Awsome Game :D
Adam West / Predator;-;Do you like Garry's Mod? Then you should buy this. Do you not like Garry's Mod, then you should buy this.
NPC Gamer;-;In a word... AWESOME!!!

Orphanzombie;-;awsome game well worth mone and expanding all the time
Redumulis;-;THIS GAME IS SO LIKE LIKE LIKE COOL LIKE YOU LIKE KNOW?
Bedroll69;-;One of the best purchases I have ever made. I have had countless hours of fun on this game and it is extremely good for the price. The best part is the steam workshop because there are so many great mods for this game and if you get bored (You Won't) Just simply download more mods and add another 100 hours to your total playtime!!! IT's great! 10/10
FoRgE;-;Better than eating a sandwich.
#rektinator;-;Singleplayer is awesome Multiplayer is full of roleplay servers with srs 12 year olds.
PotatOS Gaming;-;Garry's Mod is a game to play when your feeling sad or down, Its really nice to play it when you have Valve games installed, its nice to pose things and make things, like a flying car, a giant roller coaster, just about anything you can think, you can take screenshots to show off your skills or put something on the workshop to share with other people! Its also fun to play the multiplayer when your tired of singleplayer, in multiplayer, you can play with friends, play the gamemodes that people make, Or just mess around in the spawn menu! You can also make really funny poses and spawn in really silly stuff. Installing addons in the workshop is really nice if your making very professinal scenes or poses. Garry's Mod also has a really fun community with some very intresting achivements. If you would like to earn them. Remember! Your imagination... Is the limit!
Admiral Raven;-;While Garry's Mod is one of the most fun games I've ever played. The gamemodes is where all the fun is. From Trouble in Terrorist Town to Darkrp. There are so many things to do even if you get bored with the base game. In my opinion it get's a 10/10
Agent 69;-;This game is cool
CollisionxD;-;I LIKE THIS GAME SOOOO MUCH! i recommend it to everyone :D
GiddyArmadillo;-;Amazing in every way. Hours of fun, and the online games make it even a better deal! Prop Hunt anyone?!

LeBaguette;-;AKA The Answer to the Life, the Universe.
Escort Evan;-;Wait, you haven't bought this yet?... *Yeah Valve... Uh huh... You see him?... Take him out*
Axxy;-;Garry's Mod is an incredibly fun game, the amount of possiblities are endless, akin to the popular game series, Scribblenauts. This game has an already fully equipped arsenal of goodies to enjoy, as well as downloading player-made addons. Garry's Mod seems to be built off other Valve games; you should learn to expect long loading times and errors. The general gameplay is easy and smooth, despite the severe lagtime for slower computers. I have fully enjoyed this game and I think you, the reader, would enjoy this as well.
Victor;-;very fun. doge approve .wow
Comrade Silly Otter;-;It ruined my life, 5 stars.
Envy >S Unusual;-;THIS GAME IS FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A GREAT AMOUNT OF IMAGINATION
Cigarettes and a sad story;-;Perhaps one of the most evolved games I have ever played in my life. Garry's Mod can go from being Slenderman and killing a bunch of Dr. Breens running around with cameras to being a zombie and infecting an entire team of camping Gmen. Only in Garry's Mod will you ever see a bald man flying around with a shotgun sniping people across the map then proceeding to fly a helicopter made out of lego bricks.
Marcus Time;-;This is the Most Unique game i ever Played
UnderVoid;-;Amazing game, not just sandbox! has hundreds of custom gamemodes with almost unimagionable creations. Satisfy your creativity with Garrys Mod
BunPup;-;Very Garry, much mod.
BlueBull | 3D Intros at $0.90;-;This is a great game, I definetly reccomend it!
MWGND;-;There are no rules, no objectives, no gods, and no masters, just you and an incredibly intuitive set of menus and a rocket powered bathtub with burning headcrabs nailed to it like Satan's Christmas lights. Buy the game, is what I'm saying.
Kool-aid Grape Jammers hulk;-;Garrys Mod, one of the best selling games on steam. If u wanna buy a new game that you like making stuff out of anything! , RPing, Killing, Horror i would recomend this game. The sandbox , is alright, but the most best gamemodes are most likely to be : TTT, DarkRP. I give Garrys Mod 10/10 PLUS: it only cost $9 XD
katana hero;-;cool
Ringo;-;Endless hours of fun.
Youri;-;Great Game, Fun gamemodes to play
CRazyStudioz;-;Awsome game never gets old always something new to do!!!
Nite Walker;-;Awesome Game! 10 out of 10
Reesey124;-;Garry's mod has to be the best mod of all time. The things you can do are countless. I've put more time into this game than I'm proud of. If you are wondering if it's any good, get it. If you really want it, get it. If you can't afford it, commit suicide and hope you can play it in whatever your equivalent of heaven is. I strongly recommend you GET Half Life 2/CS:S before buying this, or you will have little to no textures. Everything will be errors or random colors. When you get bored, install mods. When you get bored of those mods, go on a server and play one of the countless game modes like TTT, Murder, Prop Hunt, and lots of other great game modes. And you can blow stuff up. 10/10
Aurimas8x;-;The most fun you can have! Awesome game.
spanekr97;-;Good game, there are many gamemode to play. For the price, definitely a good buy!
Creepster;-;This game is FUN. Oh man the amount of time I have wasted on this game. It's a FPS sandbox game where you can do anything you want! Though, bugs, greifers, and errors are present. If you can tolorate those kinds of things, go ahead and buy it!

Fb||Rabbid;-;Garry's Mod is a great game. You can download many gamemodes for it so you can do things like roleplay, trouble in terrorist town, etc. Or you can just play in sandbox mode. The graphics are realistic. I would rate this game as a 10 out of 10.

Logan M. Schrdinger's Cat;-;How can you review Garrys mod theres so much stuff for every kind of player It has so many gamemode and so many servers and is SO MUCH FUN Buy it if you dont have it already (but who does not?)
Element;-;Gmod is one of those games that'll entertain the player for a long time. With an infinite amount of things to do, it never gets boring. The community is what makes the game fun though. Fan-Created Mods and Maps provide unlimited amounts of things to do. Plus the gamemodes inside of Gmod, such as TTT or Prop Hunt, also provide some fun things to do. Overall, I would rate this game 10/10 because it's one of the funnest games I've ever played with friends, and it still keeps getting better because of the fans.
BiteTheBlade;-;Garrys Mod is a open sandbox game,you can practicaly do anything you want.Its tons of fun,and for a cheap price! I recomend this game to people who like sandboxs games and even the people who dont

Acerius;-;Acerius Review - Garry's Mod What can I say? Garry's Mod is probably my most favourite game of all time due to the extended variety of gamemodes included. Multiplayer is bundles of fun no matter what gamemode you play and it's a haven for programmers. Home to a wide palette of different audiences such as roleplayers, FPS gamers and so forth Garry's Mod is most definitely a great community to be a part of. The only issue with Garry's Mod is that it's still rather buggy in some respects but nonetheless it's exceptional. Recommended game! Gameplay: 5/5 Graphics: 4.5/5 Community: 5/5 Singularity: 5/5 Quality: 3.5/5 Overall score: 23/25
CL4PTPtheamberpampse;-;EVERYONE should get this game its my favorite game play with friends or solo download and upload addons from the workshop or the in game addon downloader. either way garrys mod is amazing and to get ALL the textures get half life 2,half life 2 ep 1/2 and counter strike source. GREAT GAME
Crakiie;-;they said you can be anything is this game. so i decided to become a chair in prop hunt, Because chairs.
Feel the heat.;-;Ultimate mess around game. Play this game if your are feeling down or having a  day
Edgar25;-;Great game unlimited stuff to do. Price is really affordable. GET IT NOW!
InTheCorner;-;Very fun in general. It's a great game overall
Cheeze&Gravy;-;garry's mod is a AMAZING game and it is a very good game if you are creative kind of person

SKULxPREDATOR2;-;Brilliant Game
Archie;-;one time i entered a roleplay server and ran up to the mayor and thrusted a harpoon through his chest while reciting mobey  I'm banned from all servers under that host 10/10
Ziox;-;I would highly recommend this game especially for only 5.99 you can't go wrong the best thing with garrys mod is that you can do so much. You can do practically anything you want and the games modding community is awesome and there is hours upon hours of fun in this game just on its own with things like trouble in terrorist town but with mods there are even more hours of content one of my favourite games. There are only a few downsides the game sometimes crashes but not too often and im using alot of mods so thats probably to be expected and although the graphics aren't anything amazing its on the source engine so most PCs can get a decent fps on this game. I would give this a 9/10
Fb||Someguy;-;U can do whatever u want. Totally epic, buy it.
Ace;-;It's almost 2014. If you don't have garry's mod yet, you should just quit.
:3;-;good game its like eating a cookie :3
Turtle;-;The game is Awesome,there are too many things to do.You can make a big car or rocket ship,or just spawn too many people and killing them with any weapons from mods or usseles weapons. I Love This Game Very Much!
Wanhan;-;Great game! So much fun to just mess around with; there is so many possiblites!
Hanz the Soviet;-;It's game without limits that gives you the tools to do anything! With a great modding community and a finite number of things to do, I must definitely say this game is worth every penny!
twitch.tv/14skehan;-;This game doesn't need a review...
Xx_SlaSh_xX;-;there's one thing to say this game has everygame in the world
GalaxyNoobDestroyer;-;I love this game if you like building machines you should get it but get it with Counter Strike Source with it because it takes almost all the errors out of the game.
PyZo;-;In a game where anyone can report you for killing em. Where all reports say your a hacker, RDM-er (even if they were the traitor) or just say you're a noob for killing em. 10/10 Will be reported again for no reason no h8
[FIN]Mr_TU0mas;-;Really cool and creative game. Thanks for creating Garry's Mod.
Watson;-;The most amazing game for just messing around and playing with friends and crashing servers.Overall the best sandbox game you could ever want.That's not it there's also Trouble in Terrorist Town now that is a good game to play with friends.If you want this game it's worth it.
John Snow;-;This game is reallyfun and i play it all the time i give it a 10/10
Devourer_of_Souls;-;such swag so may noscopes 15 out of 10 on the faze clan meter
PuNcAkE;-;I'm In Love with this game XD I could play this for hours and never be bored :D
MRNIGHTMAREZHD;-;This is a beast game
Dominion001;-;Alot of fun, especially if you play with friends, or even in a random lobby
PatPat;-;Really nice game to mess around with.
Scientific Porpoises;-;Garry's Mod is the best game I have ever played, even the non-workshop side is fun with friends and alone, but the workshop makes it better. The workshop provides thousands of addons to make each game session different and more interesting. Not to mention gamemode servers like Dark RP, Prophunt, TTT and GMT (Garry's Mod Tower, if you do not know what that is, google it now). So after playing it for over 500 hours, I can tell you it is worth it. After all, it is SIX POUNDS!
Dankey Kong (shitgun);-;Having spent almost all of my time playing Trouble in Terrorist Town all I can say is that GMod is worth getting simply for that gamemode. It can be daunting and confusing at first but that's the beauty of it. You will pick it up as you go along and you will experience different things depending on the server. As for the rest of the game, what I have experienced is a strong communtiy atmosphere across all the servers I visited and, although there can be some terrible gamemodes, I loved the variety of games. Pirate Wars is perfectly simple and possible one of the best gamemodes out there.
therealKx3D;-;Sometimes in life you just gotta go outside and spawn explosive barrels everywhere. Every Steam user should HAVE this game. No questions asked. 10/10
stevekillerz4;-;GMOD Is a very fun never ending game and probably one of my favorites
[DiCKS] MegaBass;-;A fun game that can turn into many and many hours of fun. I would recommend this game. Go get this game and play it with some friends. It is a ton of fun.
Silly Goose;-;Awesome game with endless hours of fun. Great if you are into sandbox games
jake_b12;-;Great game, I reccomend it to all. 29 hours might look pretty little to the people with thousands, but that is due to me having steam for a short amount of time. But if you do play, get some friend and play some TTT or Prop Hunt! Hope you found my review helpful!
Mz .;-;It's A Very Very Very Good Game I Recommend This Game To You Guys ...
Virus.Win32.ScootyBootyBlu;-;I'm addicted to it I need help
JonWithGames;-;I am the Lethargic Gaming TTT Server Owner and I have to say, I have put soo many hours into this game thus far and have had some of the best moments from gaming whilst playing. Definite recommendation, there are tons of things to do in this game, it's always expanding with the new creations people make. -Xevayne (Jon)
Kumori;-;The hard part isn't trying to find a good reason to buy this game... it's WHY WOULDN'T YOU BUY THIS GAME?! You can play with ragdolls, make movies, short clips, there's TTT, Prop Hunt, Darkrp, Sandbox, Lua scripting, Expression 2, the possibilities are literally endless. Don't just take my word for it, BUY THIS GAME!
Seth Rogen;-;If you don't have it get it. Now. You will first start a new game and not understand a thing, probably spawn some crap and fling it about. They are two things you will do at this point, you will quit or you will waste your life on it. The people who did the latter of the options explored the many different gamemodes and servers on it (that almost appear hidden to new players) and found one they liked. The people who play for ages probably found a online community based around one or more of the game modes. The people who quit played single play sandbox or tried a single server. If you explore it watch as your life disapears and this game takes up your life.
Jbraden95;-;Garrys MOd is by far one of the best games I have ever played, if you want an open world sandbox game this is the game for you
urban DISCO;-;great game
Regime;-;Garry's Mod is fantastically fun to play. Despite the graphics being quite dated in the current 'modern' age of gaming (with its various emphasis on stellar graphics, realistic physics (embodied by Assassin's Creed (series)'s fluidity, Portal 2, ...), the game is *fun*. Certain map modes such as DarkRP and TTT make the game worth the price of admission for the game.
C0mmanderB6con;-;What is better than shooting Halo Covies with Dubstep guns? What is better than playing Half-Life and Star Wars together? What is better than creating a flying boat cannon? You tell me amigo.
Mr.Wolf;-;( Sorry for my ENGLISH) If you asking me "What is the best game in the world" I would like to say "Garry's Mod" !! It's a game of creativity and fun I feel like I pay only at 9.99$ but what I"ll get is more than the price , I"ll feel like I buy multiple game at one time but in truth I only buy one Because of it has "ALOT" of gamemode such as 1.SANDBOX 2.Prophunt 3.Troble in Terrorist town 4.Zmod 5.DarkRP and alot more but this is what I found most enjoy and NEVER get bored and I feel like I'm buying Bioshock Infinite , Halo , Call of Duty , Mass Effect , ETC because of STEAM WORKSHOP that can make your dream possible. Garry's mod also not only a sandbox but also ACTION , HORROR , COMEDY , ETC this game also supported STEAM Workshop so you can GRAB ANYTHING YOU WANT FROM IT FOR FREE !! Just you pay once and the game NEVER ask you to pay more ( As long as Garry doens't make a wrong move) To gameplay section For singleplayer if you are playing alone you might just getting bored easily if you don't have much of a STEAM Workshop Item and stuff to play around. Singleplayer make me feel like a littleplayground which is fun for me (Because of STEAM WORKSHOP Item that raise Garry's Mod From 4.GB To 13 GB now) which most of a Steam workshop Stuff is pretty good and useful But when I'll move to multiplayer Trust me you will become an Garry's Mod Addict because of a friendly community and varions of great moment ! I'll have alot of friend's because of this game still alot of server are up and kicking Gamemode that I would like to recommand DarkRP If you like a lifelike roleplaying , This is for you (And me too) I believe this game will last forever as long as humanity still exist !! as long as the Garry's Mod Community still live If you still consider if you gonna buy it "STOP THINKING AND BUY IT" I BEG YOU THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL STEAM USER Oh I'll nearly forgot It has Achievment too and Steam trading card Is there any game that better than this ? free stuff , good community , great moment , cheap price , ETC And when you buy it do me a favor GO play it and make a good community or make a name for yourself on YouTube. Whatever just buy it bro !! ........... ...................__ .............//'...'/` ........../'/.../..../......./\ ........('(.......... ~/'...') .........\.................'...../ ..........''...\.......... _. ............\..............( BROFIST ...........

Juantanamo Bae;-;Pretty awesome game, if you don't have this game in your library then idk what you're doing in life.
Cake;-;The best game to start out on with steam!
Indiana9542;-;I think anyone who likes a game with half life 2 graphics,but is a sandbox. There are combines and turrets and citizens and helicopters and rollercoasters and sooooo much more! Sorry about that last sentence, i got carried away.............

InsaneBlitz;-;Okay, If you don't have this game you're just missing out. This game is possibly the best Sandbox game ever made. You can basicly do almost anything in this game. Next time you get some money spend it on this. I promise you won't have a single regret

Alpacalypse;-;They told me I could be anything. So I became a couch rocket scentist, and a flying bag of doritos. 10/10, would waste hundreds more hours on.
Salmon;-;Although personally I dislike the sandbox mode of this game, it really shines in it's multiplayer game modes. Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder & Prop Hunt are just one of a few many mini-games that have been created by the community, for the community. Although for these game modes you need the CS:S textures, you can download them for free from the 'Tools' tab in Steam itself. It's definitely worth the $5 that it is currently; and once you discover what Garry's Mod can do, you'll never be able to stop.
[FFG]Ash;-;a perfect game for anyone it is so good that anyone can download mods/addons and build amazing wiremod stuff and learn programing xD
Sonar;-;Went on a custom sandbox server. Spawned a bunch of mellons. Shot it with rpg. Mellons killed me Best ****ing game ive ever played. 16 trains/9 chairs

DevilRiddle;-;This is a really good game!With all different mod and gamemode you can play a variety of shift changes in this game
UnNamed;-;Dude this Sandbox game is like no other
Ededude;-;One of my most favorite sandbox games out there. With litterally Hundreds of gamemodes its very difficult to get bored of this game and was 200% worth the price i paid. So if your thinking about getting this then do it because you will enjoy most of the gamemodes no matter how pointless some of them are. *Cough* Elevator source *Cough* :3
CharSoWhat;-;Love this game, hours of fun to be had and so much variety! Definitely recommend it.
Zedd | Rape the rapeists!;-;I LOVE THIS GAME :D -Why? :o Because you can have fun with everything that is in the game and that isnt - just build yourself! You can build or make everything that you can only imagine, and for those people who dont care aboutthese things can go to another one of many other gamemodes! :) Basically this game is not only 1 game, it is many games packed in 1 amazing "Whatever" (I dont know what to call it, just think there stand anything that is amazing ;) ) If you dont already have this game - BUY IT! NAOW!! :D
MordeKai;-;A funny, friendly (in some places) game. With the most famous part of the game, Sandbox, making your own scenarios with the models from CS, TF2 and Half Life 2, or choose which one's you like from the workshop. Not to forget all the brilliant gamemodes like Trouble in Terroist Town, GMoD Tower and many many more. GMoD is that game you will always come back too. Even with some annoyances and bugs, it gets a 9/10 from me. A best buy (don't sue me) for any fun steam players. Good one Garry.
Luyann7;-;Really great sandbox game the physics are really good. Ragdalls are great. I totaly recomend this too you, you should buy this becouse this game is really and enjoyable. This game has allot of gamemodes, great servers. everything is great about this game !

Geralt of Rivia;-;What most games, exceptionally first person shooters suffer from is, play value. This game just took away countless hours of my life and was it worth it, With a vast community and workshop that has so many things to download, this is the definition of a sandbox game.

Umbreon;-;Genre: Sandbox Reccommendation: Anybody that likes even a little humor should play this game. Playtime: More than 20 hours, 300+ hours if you have friends to play with. Rating: 9/10 Review: If you're one of those people who are more like casual gamers and LOVE messing around and creating random things, this game is for you. Lots of derping and no goals, and there are even many custom, fanmade gamemodes available if you get bored. The game, obviously, allows for massive mod support, allowing you to use almost anything from whatever popular show, game, etc. in the game as long as it is in the workshop and is up-to-date with the latest version of the game. You can, for example, fly planes and helicopters, drive Need for Speed cars, interact with scripted (re-worked) NPCs like a Pikachu, and so on. One thing to note about this game though, the community sucks . Interacting with it can give many headaches. Most of the Gmod players are kids, so be prepared to mute players (IF the server lets you, which is another small let down).
Zyanok;-;You can do absolutely anything to your hearts desire ^^
Alice;-;Best game ever.Best mods ever.Best-HOLY SH*T *combines shooting* ;-; oh god.

AoAG Doctor MeeM;-;This game is so epicly funtastic
Cloud;-;It's hard to explain this beautiful art project of a "game". It's not really a game, it's more of a do whatever the hell you want! It's amazing I just wish I could meet Garry, the great man who created this game. Listen, it's a sandbox to play how you want, it's worth the money out of your pocket. Buy it.
CC_opaaaaa5;-;I think this is a great game. It's like Minecraft in that you can do whatever the hell you want to do. However, it's even more complex and projects will take even more time. But don't worry, there's plenty of content already available for the impatient.
ThePcNoob;-;this is a fun game that has many other games in it and for the price I highly suggest getting it
Baby Goat;-;Really fun sandbox game highly recommended, lots of laughs, really you should get it NOW!
The Frosty_Engine;-;Pros: It's EPIC! Cons: Garry broke it yet again even more!!
FOOT!!!!!;-;this game is the best on steam
Lava;-;Additive. Fun. Creative. Great to play, enough said. Just buy the game Cx
Eddy Nolan is a NAZI.;-;One of the best sandbox games I have ever played. This game was a success when it first came out and I'm not surprised at all. The only problem is that it causes me alot of viruses on my laptop and crashes my system. Only one downside with this game, everything else is just pitch perfect. I realised a couple of days ago that it also teaches you programming when it comes to scripting. One of the best Indie games I have ever played. Thanks, Valve! Eddy Nolan
Dark One {in HELL};-;It allows you to use your imagination and test your creativity by thinking things and then trying to figure out a way to make them happen... a fun 'game' that requires a bit of mind, too ; )
Hi I'm Marcus;-;Fun game, didn't know how to add blood effects though so I used my gun c::

freemanrepo;-;It's awesome. There's no limit to what you can do, I love it!
shills;-;this game sucks
Dopey D;-;I have anticipated this game for so long and when I finally got it, I played it for 4 hours on end. It is so addicting and fun, especially if you are playing G Mod with your friends. It is a quite popular game and it is unique. No other game allows the player to decide how he plays the game and what are the rules of it. Really one of my favourite games.
Jack!;-;Well you may as well download it seen as it's free to play.
Tinytombomb;-;Didn't hear about this game till recently, so I bought it. Had the most fun I've ever had playing a game, especially with friends. There is so much to do. Get it!

NeT | teddyman;-;You can spawn anything!!!!!! 10/10
FaLLeN;-;Garry's Mod is an amaing game. There is so much to do, so many possibilities. There is new content avalible everyday, from the steam workshop, or even a new gamemode. You can play an old classic like Trouble in Terrorist Town, or you can play the newer Murder gamemode. There is so much you can see and do in Garry's Mod. And I will continue to play it in the future because of the growing community that makes such amazing things. I give Garry's Mod a 10/10
Camo;-;This game is amazing for building what ever you want,There is also lots of differnt GameModes to play from jailbreak to Roleplay this is a must have game for anyone My favourite Gamdmode is Jailbreak :)
fnatic GAY-W;-;Yeah its good if you like: Zombies Terrorists Tension Murderr Weapons Mods Wardens 12 Year olds on crapy mics Hackers Swag

Ickleslimer;-;If your the sort of guy who likes inflating zombies and making them float aimlessly around a room, or building a diving board only to then blow it to hell without jumping it, then this is the ideal game for you.
AsM | Hodor;-;this it the best thing ever
Peat;-;Absolutely Wonderful. Perfect. I have no regrets. A motto i have with this game is, "If it doesn't have it, somebody made it." There is litterally an addon for everything from tanks to helicopters, to mechs and Pikachus. This game has sucked up my time. I love it. There is no looking back.
Big Sus;-;You can spend hours on Garry's Mod just fighting NPC's, ragdoll posing, building driving flying and more! And the best part about it is that if you get bored, just download more addons!
cancer poro;-;Love this game !!!!
Compsognathus;-;really fun to play
Verrick;-;Some of the best fun any PC gamer can have. I can't even really define it either, there's many layers to Garry's mod. You gotta see it yourself.
Kypari  #xGSmells;-;A must; this game is amazing. This game is full of fantastic content (as long as you buy it with Counter Strike Source), such as Prop Hunt, Murder and lots of other addictive games! I would definately recommend this game to everyone!
Lethal;-;This game is Extremely fun and it has absolutely no end to it. Download models guns and alot of other stuff from the steam workshop aswell as goof around with friends on your own personal server. even play hundreds of different gamemodes like Murder, DarkRP, Trouble in Terrorist Town, and many more, Definately worth the buy!
YekoD;-;Enjoyable all the time anywhere for anyone
Overheating Lilith;-;BEES. KNEES. this game is totally potatomunchtasticals. I like building things And blowing people up Poos and wees, Stop typing.
Dr. MoonMan;-;You can fly in a bathtub. I hope this becomes Up 2. 9.9/10
Commando950;-;Ever felt like you wanted freedom in your games?Well here is how you do it! Buy gmod, Start gmod, download addons/make them, and go play! Scars, Realistic Helicopters, all the hl2.exe assets! All those great addons and even great default assets!(If you have them) You should play this regardless of how you think the game might be, cause there is always something fun here. IT isn't always sandbox cause there is always gamemodes made for unique gameplay, basicly several games in one!
Hobo With A Shotgun(Agent 13);-;Well, It's about time I sat down and wrote a review. Garry's mod is a game that is all about playing online and all the creative user made game modes! Or you can download the mods you want, set up a single player game, and make your own story. Such as place about 100 zombies in a building, rush in with an assault rifle, and try not to die. There is no story mode in garry's mod so if thats what your looking for in a game, this is not for you. Also Garry's mod is not perfect, it often crashes and has alot of bugs. It has moments where your sitting there laughing and dying, and others where your ripping your hair out trying to get somthing to work. The other bad part about this game is that alot of those fun game modes need other games to work. Most common is counter strike and half life, but others include buying games like day of defeat and left 4 dead. I have played almost 1300 hours of this game and love it! I give this game a solid 8/10 Its not perfect but it is amazingly fun!
Aerico (add other acc);-;ing swagged out. Coding lua for it is fun.
Colonel7;-;yeah Garry's mod is so cool it give you so many mods to download and play on. For me they gave me Stargate Mod so now i can play with the the stargate stuff build a base and stop othr people coming to base.
Finder17;-;If you have ever liked a game where you can have total control then let me tell you that this game is for you. Nothing is better than having you and a friend fighting striders while in a Mech suit that shoots nukes from it that have a nyan explosion, nuff said.
terra;-;i used the phys gujn to make eli sex on alyx sexgiver64
EGC | Stringers;-;Best creator game all time. Lot of addons to download. Even better than TM. :D
Pawl;-;if u like girls then get this game
Pawl;-;if u like girls then get this game
MR. GPVMGAMER;-;where to begin. have you ever heard of the movie, ratatoutouille. WELL WATCH IT. That movie is like a cake, that inside is a bomb just so badly wants to explode and give everybody the surprise of dying on a birthday. This game literally rips the words out of my mouth. Though defining words would not give you anything since a "word" is acually a form of human communication. well whatever. in the movie there is a rat, that rat is totally not named rat a tat tat tat touille. this game however is the greatest thing that mankind has ever seen. except for blind people that is. disney acually filed a copyright complaint against this game for being... their exact words ' this game is too awesome and that it should be removed or our maids who clean our hotel rooms and get secretly paid below minimum wage, wil cry. not just any cry, no, these laughters and happiness's are acually part of a secret organization called in my butt. they specialize in GM vehicles. that is so off topic, any way this game is so bad hta ti think that need to be water with my pee ' it was very hard to get all that information out of the guy. i hope that next time i go to tinker winker dinker finker thisinker is getting oldinker. if you find any kind of carnival, go there i am there and i will sell you this game for 1000$. that is a 990$ rip off! i was once at a store and my sister was bitten by a mouse. this game is got the top notch characters. when there are acually no characters!
Pleb-tier Weeaboo;-;Oh the endless joy that you can have with this game.....what can't you do in this game?
dr.strangelove;-;awesome game u must have it
Taco Toucan;-;I love this game. There's so much to do, so much possibilities. I've always loved this game, because it have no real objective. Singleplayer is really fun, you can spawn ragdolls and pose them to make a scene, or tie them to horribly-made cars and make the car fly off a ramp. You can download new maps to explore and customize, or make a house for no reason! You don't have to be good at making proper-working things to have fun in this game, for goodness sake you don't even have to be creative. If you can move your mouse and click, then you can play this game! You can do whatever you want, you can make a monster out of chairs, you can make rainbow melons, you can milk carton fireworks if you'd like! It gets even better with the addons button. Just go to the menu, click on the "Addons" button and you have another whole world of inventions, ideas, creations, and craziness! Do you want a tool that will turn things and yourself into a melon? Then get the addon for that! (It's called the Melonificator!) Do you want a working piano that you use to play song with your keyboard? Then get the addon for that! (Playable Piano) Do you want ragdoll Pokemon? Then get the addon for that! (Pokemon ragdolls pack). There's so much more addons, which means there's so much more possibilities! Now, with all of that, it's definitely worth $9.99! (American Dollars!) But there's more- mulitiplayer! Multiplayer opens up the world of other people's ideas and creations. Do you want to watch YouTube videos in a movie with other people saying if they like it or not? Then go on 'Cinema' mode. Do you want to pretend to live another life, get a job, live in a house, and interact with other people who are pretending to be 'neighbors?' Then go on Roleplaying mode! (There's lots of types of roleplaying modes, be careful on which one you choose!) There's Sandbox mode, TTT mode (Trouble in Terrorist Town) and lots more, I can't even name them all! Now, I know this has been a long review, but if you think this is all you can do if Garry's Mod, then you are dead wrong! I haven't named much of anything compared to all the possibilities in this game. But there are a few errors- 1. If you're new to the game (which you probably are), then the instructions and tips are very confusing to follow, I had a tough time getting used to this game. 2. Very hard to create things like houses, or put up doors, and most of the time the game with glitch and you'll likely have a hard time achieving what you want to do. 3. The controls were confusing for me. That's all I need to say. :-/ There are a little bit more problems, but then there's the main question you're likely asking. "OK, so is this game worth $9.99?" (Again, American dollars) Well, in my honest opinion, yes! If you don't buy this game, you have no idea what you're missing on! I give this game 9.5/10 stars.
fluffingtons;-;Good game, cheap, hours of fun. Although you need Counter Strike: Source to play a lot of this game, it's still worth it. I'd personally rate this 8.5/10.
opwsa4ever;-;It's a must have, it's one of the best clusters ever made with all those gamemodes inside you will never be bored again
ELfreakO;-;i love this game
Malkara_Darkwel;-;I recommend this game purely because of prophunt. I mean hiding as a soda can having armies of people chasing you with machine guns unable to hit you is a blast. Or getting trapped as a stove and no one noticing you sitting there next to two other stoves while taunting them as they enter the room and surving the round hilarious or running around as a coffee cup following a hunter around just waiting for them to look behind them and spot you is pure adrenaline pumping fun.
Sypadizer;-;It's an amazing game,no,TOOL for all your wildest dreams. Because the real world sucks! You can't pitch your idea/invention to companies because of "The risk of negative profit." In Garry's Mod,your idea is welcomed in with opened arms,cake,balloons and music. Some come live in Gmoddington like the other 1+ million people who all told us that they wouldn't leave for the world!
SugarTits;-;You! Yes, You the one Breathing!!!! Buy this Game, Play it, love It!! NOW!!! Why Are you still here??? Go buy it!
SaxySavvy;-;Garry's Mod is one of the most addicting and fun games on Steam... This game is defently worth it. All the time and fun moments you get when playing online with your friends (not using Hamachi). If you got any problems with Hamachi just delete it and download Tunngle, since my friends and I downloaded Tunngle.. we didn't had any problems anymore with connecting to eachother :D Further I would defently recommend this game! BEST GAME ON STEAM EVER! Groupname: #Potato Gang
[C@$H] AverageG;-;garrys mod is probalbly one of the best games ive ever played and i think in my ipinion its probably the best game in the world
Kosherkill;-;This is the best game ever made!!!!! i have played over 300 hours and it sill never gets boring!!!!!

Jeffhub113;-;this is a good game for people who likes to build and thing like killing people on it too
Titanium2^^;-;Hi i gonna review the so called "Garry's mod" ah, i remember when i bought this.... about 1.5 year ago i bought this game for 10 euro! no regrets! its like a new game everytime you download a new addon! as a PC veteran i think its a really well made game with a few glitches, not many! this game is one of those "must play before i die" game... this game was a mod in the beginning... A MOD FOR HALF LIFE 2? this is one of the best games i everplayed and you wont regret buying this, the sandbox mode is what i play the most, i love to play alone and make up scenes where im a soldier and im in a war between the rebels and the combines! buy this instead of that... what is it called? goat simulator or the stopid bad rats! 10/10 -Spy reviews!
ace nugget;-;i regret every minute i put into this game but i keep playing it
Mike (Turek) Wazowski #POTATO;-;Alot of french and german people. 11/10
SonicMurch;-;If you buy this game you will never regret it. I seriously have never laughed so hard in my life untill i played this game. Its just the greatest! theres so many kooky things to do its so cool!
darctini;-;how do i terrorist
Commander Camel-Toe;-;Yeah Garry's mod is pretty sick, needs way more Goats and Australian servers though. It's much better with a few friends and goats overall Garry seems like a top bloke for making this. Cheers to Garry. 3 claps for a great specimen. Cheers Fellas
@TheGamingMelonCameron;-;the best sandbox game i have ever played...its what game i go to when im bored and i have a ton of fun after that it is awesome i very much recommend this game to all of you
WellingtonTheDuke;-;To do list: - Blow up hitler _DONE_ - Start an abortion clinic _DONE_ - Snipe head SS leader after attracting her to a spot on the road _DONE_ - Walked out of Prison and got Hitler's autograph _DONE_ - Kill hitler again after sneaking into his office _DONE_ - Held out aginst hordes of nazis _DONE_ This game was rather decent.
Da_bro14;-;You can pose their hands to flick people off 10/10
Putin The Mad King;-;YOU WONT STOP PLAYING THIS GAME ITS SO GOOD
Over The Horizon.;-;Herpity herp heerp 10/7 Good to have fun! I'm lovin' it
Snitch;-;One of my best games.This is amazing for people who need cheering up and like to mess around!:D
Discorded Derpy Hooves;-;One fun, cool, and the best game ever. =3
Rambonxious Puppy;-;This game is AMAZING!!! It's what you get when you inject minecraft with steroids. The Description Doesn't tell about the hundreds of gamemodes other gamers have created. And the more source games you have installed, the more props and textures you have too. Epic. 10/10
winteR;-;This is literally one of the best games ever made! There is so much to do in this game. Firstly, there is the community created content which is amazing, secondly, there is the content supplied by the creator which lets you do so much, and thirdly, there are a ton of gamemodes to play with your friends! This is well worth your $10 and eveyone should get it! MUST HAVE!
Apollo;-;great game get it now!
JakeFromStateFarm;-;This game is so much fun! Worth every penny.
AyeItsHuntah;-;this is absolutly the best sandbox game for steam. this is amazing. a must have
El Skillio;-;Is nice!!
Nic0l0;-;Huge fun, enabled through a huge part of the source mod. + many friends + Teamspeak/Skype = awesome gaming-experience (if you don't have a "low-end-PC" or bad internet = causing laggs...or even weird friends, telling you the whole time you sound like a pimp/pander...) + MANY different modes, you can spend a lot of time on... (- much time required to download ressources...) + you can use it in many different ways, for example to make a little movie/advertisement through funny images/cuts you can create (but for this reason, I'd recommend "Source Filmmaker", this one requires some time to learn how to use it, but it s way better to create a movie thorugh the Source-mod) + very good price-preformance ratio, reduced = instabuy - if you dont want to get vision problems/ eye cancer through missing textures, you practically have to install many Source-games, like CS:Source, TF2 or Half Life
ThatAfkGuy;-;If you don't buy this then... Wow... You're missing out in a lot. As you can probably tell by the ammount of hours I've spent playing this game, hopefully you can understand that it's the best game and the most fun you can ever have on PC.
Drew;-;This game is so awesome, you can play all of your favorite games that youtubers all over enjoy showing, including TTT, PropHunt, Sandbox, and much more! If you ever want a fun game to do WHATEVER you want, this is the game for you, so make sure to ask your parents to buy you this for Christmas!
Razy - Eurotruckradio.com;-;brilliant game. got many choices of gamemodes and i highly reccomend it.
arrow raider;-;One of the best games I have got on steam. Zombie Surival, Racing mellons, flying Space ships, you name it this game has it. The playability is endless. Play with your friends for hours of fun.
AshLeyTheRyuko;-;Its a great game you should buy it!
[..G] Bdg;-;this is a fun game u can do nearly anything.

ayy lmao;-;uber duber danktastic 10/10 would play multiple times
retr0;-;Yes Very Good gaem i sugest play
Mr.Illusion;-;its an awesome game
Waka Flocka Flame;-;Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. 9/10, a great game with a good community if you know where to look.
Profound Sadness;-;Wow many Garry. Such mod. Wow. Very fun . such recommend. wow .woufe.
Zazra;-;Perfect for trying any crazy ideas you may have. Pretty fun.
Cannibalcarebear;-;ITS FUN IF YOU LIKE MODS
ITS A TRAP!!!;-;this is a physics sandbox game where you can build anything you want... literaly. you can build a castle, a car, and pretty much anything else. i reccomend this game to E-V-E-R-Y-O-N-E. plus it doesnt cost that much
Tahm Kench;-;cool
Wolf;-;is very good. would want all of steam to buy.
YT: ItsGizmoYT;-;Great Game i love this and i can make my own server for my friends and i can play on :D youtube.com/TorRekTV for the video on how to set it up :D

Lie Ren;-;this game is amazing and recommended to anyone with an awesome and open mind
Sat;-;I'm batman. And let me just say. This game was gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Campaign sucked. Multiplayer servers are always empty, and then the mods for this game actually make it worse. Would play again.
Doug The Destroyer;-;Its A amazing game and i love it and you will too!!!!
Kappa;-;One of my favorite games of all time
KryOtech (away again);-;this game isjust fabulous. you cab do what ever you want and this is not very expensive game :D
The Ultimate Musician;-;I originally bought this for fappping purposes but soon discovered how fun it was to troll in terrorist town. Just wait for the weapons to go live and shoot everybody regardless if you 're a traitor or an innocent. Try baiting other innocents into killing you or vice versa get them to kill another innocent if your a traitor. I also recomend joining the serious TTT servers and pretend you are a traitor even if you arent by stealth killing people. That way theres no way to track who did it. Good fun for that. I also recommend downloading nude models and posing them in lewd ways so thats even better.
unoriginal name;-;The best game for randomly doing things that other games wouldnt allow you to do. Also, that community has made enough gamemodes for this game to fill up the sun. assuming that gamemodes actualy have physical substance, but this review has gotten off track. buy this game if you want to randomly shoot stuff, play TTT, or build gigantic monuments to your utmost awesomeness. bacicly, buy this game
Boonty Hunter;-;Great Game
OneManIceCubeZz;-;This game is the best thing you can buy. Get it.
Duck Hunter;-;This is the prequel to Garry Newman's Incident. Its nice to see how it all started.
Sempiternal;-;Nice Game, So many mods to choose from :) Verry nice

[V!P]Squishy_Goo;-;its beautiful
Mr_Fluffy_Doom;-;Garrys Mod is a brilliant sandbox which you can make thousands and thousands of things. Garrys mod also has hundreds of gamemodes like TTT (Trouble In Terrorist Town) or Prop Hunt even melon bomber. Garrys mod has an amazing community that is really friendly and helpfull Note you do come across a few horrible people but thats just the way the internet is. Garrys mod uses the workshop to its maximum potential with free dupes (Things people have made that you can spawn if they chose to publish it) mods (Mods are modifactions that make the game better or add things like maps, models, NPC's, vehicles and player models) Garrys mod got me into making things for the community such as this review or my guide on how to change it to night or the hover car I made. Anyway the point I am trying to make is that this is a great game. Thank you for your time and I hope I see you in game.
ImSpaceCop;-;you can make people hump stuff 10/10
Drunken Manatee;-;I have nothing to say about this game that anyone else hasnt said before. The possibilities are literelly endless.
Serperior2150;-;I Spawned 500 Teletubbies and blew them all up. 10/10
chef;-;A fun game that allows for a lot of creativity and various game modes. A community so toxic that it'll give you lung cancer.
Stormize;-;Pretty cool and addictive game, especially when you've so many friends build or design crazy things with. I recommend, and ofcourse the whole world does, go buy it xD
Stark;-;I don't know.. It's okay... I guess... [Tries to remember what life outside the house is like].. *Sighs...*
STicK__;-;Buy it. Download it. Play it. Love it.
namrog84;-;Never had more fun. Garry's Mod has so many mini and metagames in it. Many hundreds of hours of fun were had here!
N1ggerStoleMyPony;-;Love This Game
rbnoidea2000;-;With this game the posibabilitys of how you have fun are endless, weather your trying to build a mastermiece or just messing around with spawning things, playing games like prop hunt with friends, garrys mod will provide you with fun for hours apon hours of simple fun! all for juse $10 10/10
d3north_4K;-;Get this. its a game about whatever you want it to be about. It is what you make it.
Huddles&Cuddles;-;> very complex > very fun You can do so many things and build so many things but you got to know how to Me im still a noob at it. i dont know how to do anything cept for spawn things and shot things :D I rarely play it but when i do i try to do different things and learn different things. most youtube videos about games are sometimes made from Garry's mod. I know that there are some people who spend their WHOLE day 24/7 on something like this and their ******* pros at this and can make full working robots and trains and ****. If you're one of those people i defiently recommend this game for you
CaptainShiffer;-;Best Game EVER! always entertains me and never gets old! there are always new gamemodes and fun things to do on this EPIC game!
Alsion;-;Love this game. Especially Prop Hunt.
Lox;-;With over 1500 hours worth of pure play time, I can say with confidence that this game is one of Garry Newman's (Creator of Garry's Mod) finest. This game will let you do ANYTHING your mind and heart desires. I have spent so much time in this game and haven't even seen half of all the awesome stuff you will be able to do. There are tons of different gamemodes. All from "Role Playing" that you're an average citizen in a small town, to "Parkouring" from building to building, to playing tribute gamemodes in honor of other games such as "Slenderman" or "Attack on Titan", to playing Hide and Seek as props. All I can say is that I would definitely recommend this game to anyone no matter what size or age!
Cman3144;-;Garry's Mod.. What more could you ask for? A game where people can build, roleplay, do custom gamemodes, and what ever you could imagine.. Its just a remarkable game... Anyone who says other wise is either a little 8 year old troll or some idiot.. I mean really.. This game is awesome.. If your into roleplaying there are over 100 servers to choose from! And many diffrent gamemodes.. I can't say anything else really.. Its just amazing.. I HAVE To Recommend This Game.. All my friends play it.
Juju;-;This game will provide you with many hours of gameplay with your fellow players. Highly recommended if you like multiplayer.
Ghost Mandrake;-;Shanking 10 year olds is fun
Ghost Mandrake;-;Shanking 10 year olds is fun
Pasko;-;Fun for the whole family. Especially if you wanna be a drug dealer, policeman or traitor to a terrorist organization.
Po;-;you should own this  ;p
A Rare Kinda Piggle;-;Can build a tub full of babies and ride it down a icy hill..... 11/10 would play again
Columbidae;-;You can't go wrong with this game. With an endless sea of mods, gamemodes, and maps, you'll never get bored, and you'll definately find something you love in this game, no matter who you are.
Deciduous Pineapple;-;Be forewarned! Ye of which hath bought this game, shalt waste precious time wasting many-an-hour into all of the various gameplay modes, maps and such. Once in the clutches of this beast, ye cannot return from whence ye came in the gaming world. "Also, 10/10, best game 4 life, great story, could've used more dogs." - IGN
Period;-;i lost a portion of my life because of this  buyers beware
Nat_the_Potato;-;Played 2000 hours Still takes me 30 minutes to join a new server 10/10
ChuckleBeats;-;Listen here u lil' , this is one of the best games of all times, a must buy. The main reason to have STEAM.
"P"urp;-;Great game, i suggest you buy it!

Ninjaboybob;-;Great game one of my favorite sandboxes you can literaly do anything, Highly recomended game.
Anarchy;-;Garry's Mod is one of those games perfect for a specific audience. Although Garrys Mod is also a extremely modable game allowing the game to expand to people with different interests. Garrys Mod simply started off as a sandbox for people who love goofing around like most sandbox games. But like most good games to date the modding community took over creating quite the load of mods ranging from simple and fun addons to entire gamemodes which completely changed the game. For example on garrys mod you can do the usual sandbox and just play around or you can explore the vast majority of gamemodes that range from roleplaying servers to terrorists killing eachother. Without the modifications of the modding community to date this game wouldn't be impressive at all but with the power of modding community this game is extremely fun and time consuming, It never gets boring due to the extensive gamemodes each one reviving the game and only giving you more to do. This game is one of my favorite games on steam 10/10
Joe Dirte;-;These were my journals I wrote when I first played this game. MrClaydoeClaydoe: im playing with this er whos autistic or somthing MrClaydoeClaydoe: he cant ing speak MrClaydoeClaydoe: im laughing my  off MrClaydoeClaydoe: i felt bad for him so i left MrClaydoeClaydoe: why is everyone 6 years old You decide if you want this game.
Moist Cabbage;-;8/8 would m8 again
-MMO-crappy_cobra;-;this is the best game in the history of sandbox games!
frnkln421;-;Well Lets Just Say I Laughed, I Cried And I Mostly Died. This Game LETS YOU DO ANYTHING. Movies, Games You Name It. Minecraft With An Edge 20/10. Nuff said
Elite;-;This game it hours and hours of fun with all its different games and add-on's.
Lil' Neko;-;If you looking for a fun, silly, creative, sandbox type of game then this game is for you (Garry's Mod) It's just so funny and so addictive in so many ways you can not explain it.. really you should give it a try, you Won't regret it :D
DoCharlieBrown;-;Very well created game
Phat Stacks of Benjamin$;-;This game .................................. is Cool?????????
Cratorin;-;Very cool
Dharinn;-;this game awesome :D make me launch everyday i like Garry's Mod Thanks
Totally Not Insane [Chat];-;This is possibly one of THE most creative yet destructive games I have ever played. When it comes to multiplayer, you and your friends can do anything! From taking on a horde of combine soldiers, to leisurely relaxing and building something of your imagination. BUT! This game does not only have sandbox mode, it has plenty of others, all of which are very exciting. Trouble in Terrorist Town is a game where you use your wits, skills, or your weapon to kill the traitor or the innocents. Prop hunt is personally my favorite in Garry's mod, you can disguise yourself as a prop in the map, and the "hunters" will have to find you. But be careful, you only have 30-25 seconds to hide. There are plenty of other things to do in Garry's mod, but I am afraid if I list them all, I can waste your time explaining it to you when you can be playing it! Consider getting Garry's mod. -Alucard Hellsing approves of this game and message-
dRAGZ-;-;Really fun game modes such as TTT and Prophunt
Just Tooney;-;Warning: Possible effects of Garry's Mod are as follows: Addiction, Insane periods of playing time, Jumping to different gamemodes every 20 minutes, and completely impossible to avoid. Unless you or your loved ones have a life, i recommend you dont get this game... If you dont have one, BUY IT.
rybo :D;-;If you have Steam, you must have this game! Endless possibilites.
Birthday Vitzel;-;You can be a melon. 10/10
Pikaschu;-;This is a game where it gives you endless Opprotunitys to make Anything Come True! A sand box, Zombie Survival Ect You can do Anything Build Create Mods Saves Demos Ect Its Really fun In my Opinion. I Recomend This game Alot im on it Every Day you Wont Regret It. Save Memorys! After You Buy it You will be on it 24/7 Over Thousands Of mods Game modes Saves Demos Maps Cars Guns Ect Ect. This is a game Any Energized Fun communic person will play.
Nokillings;-;A game to play with your friends. It has a great multiplayer aspect you can't get out of another game. Hundreds of gamemodes from betraying your friends in Trouble in Terrorist Town to building a sled and beating random people online in Sled Race. This game has hundreds and hundreds of hours of fun and you won't be disappointed. This is a sandbox game made for everyone and their mother! Ten dollars is a steal for this game and it is one of the best game you will ever play.
TheBulginator;-;I LOVE GARRY'S MOD! I think that it's one of the greatest game ideas and I'm just wondering what it has in store for the future.
Dirk Captor;-;I highly recommend this game, if you love random play. A little confusing at first, but it gets better as you learn. great game/great price. ;3
totally not luis;-;I guess it's pretty good
ZBAZZ123;-;AMAZING!!!! You can do whatever you want whenever and play multiple gamemodes
Krazyctk;-;it, is, GREAT. i once spent an entire night playing it. So no , i love it.
[EG]JTW;-;Played for 311 hours in total, sparta kicked breen off a ledge, fus ro dah'd some NPC, and then, I made a catapult that slung a pony ragdoll into the sky. Go and click the buy button for this game IMMEDIATLY.
MrDarkTroll.EXE;-;I fine "Garry's Mod" a realy fun and multi-gamemoded game, Fun playing it with your friends and realy a realy atractive game. And this is why i recommend this game: Its Realy Fun Game To Mess Arond With.
rikkuness;-;I made a flying .
Sir Pyr0 Flamington;-;Friend built a giant  and thursted it towards me. 10/10
FrostedCaik;-;FRIKIN AWESOME!!! Best part is about sandbox, able to fool around!
samfisher47;-;Fun game, EXTREMELY fun with friends though!
Fat 'o Pedia;-;everyone needs to play! 9/10
SniperMags;-;Fun and entertaining. Each game mode may be difficult to understand at first, but after a while you get the hang of it. The only downside to it is that it is difficult to play if you do not have the textures for the maps if you do not have the files for them. Other than that it is a great game to buy and play with friends
domanick1o;-;First of all if your reading this You Must Love GMOD 2nd THIS GAME IS FRECKING 10 DOLLARS OH MY GOD WHAT A GREAT DEAL FOR A FULL ING GAME. I mean seriosoulsy you'd be stupid to not to buy it. But 1 thing The Community is Complete  i mean People Always Say Rdm and 7 years olds SAY YOU HACKER. OK but some servers are great. Like Simple TTT and WhyNotZoiUR NOT A COMPLETE  (also all the bad comments are becasue little People think there so Better than you when they have a frecking  little laptop)
ejboy7;-;Downloaded a map. Spawned a bunch of combine soldiers in a building. Gave myself a bunch of ammo. Made myself invincible. Killed them all. Did it again 11/10
tron;-;Spent so many hours on this game. So many gamemodes its like buying 5 different games; and I got it for less than a fiver! Never played a game as much as this.
Dr. Science;-;I feel sorry for anyone who puts 100 hours on this turd get call of warcraft instead.
White Ice  S> Unusual;-;This is a good game, but can freeze quite a lot.
[AGSY]sW;-;I can make anything. ..... 10/10 good game no probs...
TheJordanSixFifty;-;i've been picked on / cyberbullied on this game but im still ok! :)
Detective Chmilewsky;-;Look at my hours, that should describe it enough, right? Not only has roleplaying in this game for several years given me thousand of hours of enjoyment, but it also helped my writing skills, and made me the linguist I am today. Not interested in roleplay? How about base building? Base wars? Zombie survival of various flavors? Pirate ship wars? Running through a maze of traps with dozens of other players while three players are determined to set traps to kill you all? Space build? There are dozens more game-modes, and new ones come out every couple of days.
{=Dark MS Slenderman BOT=};-;this game is the best i ever played is fun playing if other people on :) but some time i feel lonely went i play alone :(
DavyNator;-;If you don't like 1 game mode. Is this game a game for you! Because, in this game you have hundered of game types you can play, from horror to RPG's and from jailbreaks to zombie survivals.
Oliwally2;-;i recomend this its freaking awesome
Chosnuk;-;This isn't a game. This is everything.
Daanu;-;WHO THE  IS GARRY? 9/10

Rogue Cheney [Away on Holiday];-;If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob a bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.
Hans;-;i wish i had more time to try this game out altered roleplay is the best community ever tho
Star_Hawk_;-;Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway. "Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm... _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more. _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore. _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds. _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want. _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10 Overall 8.5 Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod -Star_Hawk_

Valiantttt;-;Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.
Hoffa;-;You don't log 6000+ hours in a bad game if you get what I mean. http://youtube.com/Hoffa1337
FB||Gillan_Greenleaf | KinguWIN;-;When I first bought this, my friend said "not a game, bro." He was right. It's not a game. It is your world. Do with it what you wish.
Asian-chan;-;You can spawn watermelons. 10/10
orane;-;An amazing game. Truly the first game with infinite free DLC. With millions of maps and plenty of gamemodes, Its a win.
Squishy Tomato;-;12/10 "Like Minecraft without blocks" -Wild Lenny
Hallows Eve;-;Amazing game worth way more then 9.99!
Bill Nye The Russian Spy;-;Garrys nod is not a game. It is a tool used for making your own creations and games. garrys mod runs on the source engine which means you will need to have source games to play it mainly Half LIfe 2 and CounterStrike Source. even though this seems like alot of money just to play one game it is worth every penny.
TheyThinkImNinja;-;So lets say your looking for a game that has anything you have ever wanted, but you dont know what you want. this game is it, you can play anything from Sandbox to Melon Bomber, you say to yourself you will only play this game every so often, as something to transition between games, but no... you need this game, even if you dont know it yet this game will take over your life, say goodbye to your friends and family, say hello to jihads and spawn menus... Gmod is the game that will consume your soul!!!
sheb19275;-;Give my friend this game. name Kris19275 add him. 11/10

legoguy22[GMSC](VTX 12 leader);-;for me, gmod is the best game in the world !!! but it needs alot of stuffs: a good pc(if you have a laggy one, your game will keep crashing), a good graphic card, money(to buy the game),you must be smart (stupid people wont be able to play this game) and alot more...
10fd3nd3rm3n;-;An amazing sandbox game, really allows you to create what you imagine. And, some of the talented people can make animations in it.
Rafrasan;-;I can use a baby doll to kill my friends 10/10
vlfire;-;The worst game i have played in my life. I have played so much that it ruined my health.
Xinnji;-;Truly a sandbox game, Garry's mod is made amazing through the combination of a good graphics and physics engine (the source engine), tools that allow you to do anything you can think of, and how easy it is to make it your own. If you've thought of it, it's in Garry's mod. Play this game!
Fire Muncher (JzCraftFCR);-;As good as it is people start to think that all of the things in gmod (gman,combine,headcrab) are made from garry and that gmod is a valve game.No.Buy gmod if you know from what game are these!
jt20816;-;garrys mod is very and a good game to play in SINGLEPLAYER.because theres always a troll or little kid on a of the servers.don't get me wrong i have seen a little kid shout over a crappy mic "IM THE COP IM THE COP IM THE COP IM THE COP" for 5 mins killing anyone in sight.and there are many trolls most comon are greifers and spawn killers who place bombs on the spawn and kill people who respawn. greifers use the remove tool,bombs,grenades and RPGs to destroy buildings and people while the admin is doing something else or standing somewhere not moving.and theres that one troll that spawns in too lag items he duped but didn't release to the public that almost crashes the server instantly. garrys mod can be very fun but GOD the comunity is AWFUL Rating:8/10
Combatkitty44;-;Lot's of gamemodes and lots of fun.
Mr. Recon Tranker;-;Best game. You can do many things, can get mods, and it is VERY easy to learn! You can pose, play with friends (somehow), do everything your mind comes to! Yes, I f*cking said everything. Horror, sandbox, many other sh*t, now all in one game. You can even do HL2 campaings and other sh*t at this! How awesome is that?! Jesus! :D
ApeNinja;-;Woudl recomend if your are into doing what ever you want. Sandbox is so fun even without addons. Also being able to play other gamemodes makes it better
Devil_Dawn(Lost a bet);-;A game where you can basically do anything. I reccomend it for all gamers.
DXNero;-;Great game with friends or random players :D
Audino;-;"Valve broke the modding community... by revealing that most of them are c***s." -Garry on Twitter.
Mom3ntum;-;This  is dope yo
Latino Susan;-;6. This game is worth so much more. I've spent months on this it's that good.
(OFWGKTA)(SHG)Kayden;-;Will get boring after a while but thats why theres muliplayer and not just a few game modes but Millions such as HL2 role play campaign
spertokuz;-;this game is the best thing that i have ever played
Zerothe0_0;-;I loved messing around,spawning random stuff in, and simply jsut looking at other peoples dupes or making my own. I like it.
noRktreSS (Ermac) [Road to MG];-;Garry's Mod is a modification for the 2004 game Half-Life 2. It adds features which enable the player to have a "Sandbox" experience, Sandbox being building stuff, like houses or robots. There is also a multiplayer mode where people can show off creations or battle it out with Half-Life 2 weapons. Then there is also content that can be used from other games, CSS is almost required for a good GMOD experience. The community then expand the game to add more gamemodes and other addons like new weapons or non-playable characters. Graphics can't really be judged, it's graphics are basically of 2004 standard, and since HL2 had good graphics for its time, GMOD gets good graphics too, if it was made in 2004. Graphics - 9.8 / 10 There is no story, music, artwork, or any of that. You can't say anything about this game. Now for my experience... I wasted 400+ hours that I'd never get back. 10% of it went to sandbox, trying to make animations and screwing around with NPCs and console commands. 5% went to gamemodes like Prop Hunt, or Trouble in Terrorist Town. 1% of it went to playtesting my WIP gamemode. Now, the last 84%... I spent on DarkRP. I don't like DarkRP BUT-BUT BUT BUT BUT I CAN'T STOP! I'll tell you why, going Gun Dealer just to purchase guns so I can raid the PD as Hobo, hearing the cries of children as I RDM them, arresting admins while being in a sit, it's all too fun. Stealing cars then using them in street races, Street Racing as a taxi driver, Kidnapping a police officer, Killing that police officer, Scamming people in exchange for death, Prop climbing into bases, Destroying their money printers, It's all TOO FUN. Also, you can have fun with the other 16% I spent, it's probably more worth your time. Overall, Garry's Mod gets a 9.5 / 10, it is fun and wastes all your time, it has a wide variety of gamemodes and new content always coming out. It doesn't get a full 10 because the amount of annoying children on this game is... "OVER 9000"
Stan;-;13yr-old called me a virgin  after he found out i was the traitor. 13/10
Chief Y'Trap Nomel;-;This game ruined my life. 10/10. #740+hours
Pukychz;-;Here is my story. i created a nuclear shelter consisting entirely of bananas and bricks. I then created a Semi truck inside it. Next, I spawned an army of osama bin ladens to protect me. I spawned a nuclear bomb two feet away from the bunker. I quickly entered the semi truck and hoped for the best. The osamas died. I lived 10/10
Maze;-;Garry's Mod is amazing with all the different types of gamemodes! It is totally worth the $10 it costs!

Mr.Illusion;-;its an awesome game
Waka Flocka Flame;-;Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming.

Profound Sadness;-;Wow many Garry. Such mod. Wow. Very fun . such recommend. wow .woufe.
The Pyrorex Alpha;-;Garrys Mod can be quite a difficult game to get into but when you get into it, Its really fun. All of the gamemodes open up a new era and it is fun. I personally recommend Attack On Titan for everyone who likes Attack on Titan Manga and Anime. I would rate it a 4/5
Happy Spy;-;its awesome and fun you should buy it! you wont regret finding it and PLAYING IT :D get gmod today!
Dr. Zeus;-;really fun to screw around in :P
Burritobane43;-;Best time to be had given with friends involved.

Will Make a mod for your self Share your stuff with dupes And such more thanks to Garry' Newman for the Mod Gabe For Half life 2 Gabe For CSS GABE FOR EVERTHING Buy it is just 10 dollar worth money THAN ING MINECRAFT 27 Dollars not worth But this HELL YEA
Darker;-;Garry's Mod. I can't describe the possibilities that come out of it. It's an endless game. If building is your fancy, just select a map in Singleplayer and use the materials given to you to build what you like. If you are into mystery based gameplay, try Trouble In Terrorist Town. Maybe you are one of those guys/gals who like to roleplay anywhere, anytime, and with anyone, DarkRP is made for you. Coming from Counter-Strike Source with all the Surfing, B-Hopping, and Deathrun? There is all of that and more compacted into this game. 2000+ hours of my life has been spent on this game and I don't regret any of it. This game's rating deserves a 10/10 no doubt. Buy the game now and experience everything you could imagine!
Baby Sawngkittyburdy;-;Garry's mod is a sandbox game. If your not into sandboxes theres many more you can do. Terror In Terrorist Town, Prophunt, Roleplay, Gmod Tower, ect. The only requirements are source engines. Such as Counterstrike Source, Half-Life 2 or Day of Defeat Source. The long loading is just to load all the big stuff to make you enjoy the game as much as possible. So whats the bad stuff you ask...Just spazzing ragdolls, RDMers, missing textures...Nah. First, Spazzing models are funny. Second, RDMers can be kicked or banned by moderators. Unless you have godmode, heh. Third, Missing models can be stopped with buying the source engines. "bu7 whi doesn7 t7 w0rk in gm0d t0wa" Well, first. It clearly says download their texture packs. Exactly. I give this game 10/10 stars for not being other than good. Well, you saw this. Now go play the game! :D
officer slickdick;-;I like garry when he mods my butt
Fripp;-;Gmod can be any game you want, and thats why I think its one of the best games you can find. Its combining a FPS/Sandbox/Multiplayer game all in one. Which is a great game in and of itself. :P
The_One_Mitchell;-;you can play with your friends create new things go beond the normal limit GAME OF THE YEAR 2014 FOR STEAM PRODUCT awesome just plain awesome.
Gary;-;Very addicting! This game is for all people, no matter whta you want to do, this game is capable of giving what you want. If you want to hunt for hidden people disguised as objects, this is for you. (Prop Hunt.) If you wish to roleplay as a variety of characters in emersive areas. (Roleplay [Clockwork]) If you wish to stand along with Traitors, unaware who wants to kill you. (Trouble In Terrorist Town) This is just a few of hundreds of different gamemodes, allowing anyone to have fun.
_Cornbeef_;-;really good game got 50+ hours game time and planning to play alot more!
Lord_Kilander;-;Garry's mod is a great game that has infinite possibility. From Sandbox to Prop Hunt. The time wasting is infinite. So play now!
RagingRice;-;I can drive a boat backwards on land <3
C776Charger;-;This sandbox game will provide you with some hours of entertainment, whether that's building a vehicle, doing role playing, having fun with games with friends, making videos to show to the world, or just goofing around, Garry's Mod provides a variety of game modes and a very high amount of Workshop items for you to try!

Ojo-Cat;-;I barely play this game obviously.
Sting Ray;-;One day I was playing xbox in my room and having fun. Then I got a boner out of no were so I started to jerk off rapidly and then the worst thing happened. A en guy  mother en gorilla fly is through my window and is laying on the ground in front of me. And well  I came before I could hold it in and it landed right in his face. He stands up and looks at me with his balls and  hanging there. I was scared out of my mind because he looked at me like he was going to  me in the  hole. Then out of no were Mickey Mouse came flying through the window and hit that  in the face. Then the gorilla started ing the  out of Mickey. I backed up in the conner as those two trie to  the other in the . Grab my shotgun and was going to waste the  out them but then he showed up uncle en grandpa. When he came through the window he said good morning and we all just stared. And I aimed and shot is small little balls off Micky and the gorilla was freaken out. They both went in the corner and was shacking like es. Uncle grand pa was holding his balls or should I say hole. I took my cup and  in it hard core and make that mother er eat it. He cryed on and on when the. When it was down his throat I took my boots and smashed the  out of his face. I saw the brain and ripped it out of his en head and ate it. Micky and the gorilla was crying like es. So I blow off mickys head and pulled out my knife and stabed that gorillas but hole so my  could fit in it. I ed that monkey and made him . Then mist walked in and I cut of that gorillas balls and shoved it down mist throat. The I took my knife and cut that s head off and shoved his head up the gorillas . The what u call a ed up fivesome.

DPT.DartPower /S/;-;,         ,  Sandbox          Minecraft!   ,    ;)
jakubnech890;-;if you like sandbox games this is what you are shearching for,but this game isn't only sandbox, there are lots of interesting and beautiful gamemodes, i think is one of the best games i ever played. :D
Palmer;-;Awsome
Flappy;-;Where do I begin... This game is straight up one of the best PC games you can buy today. It's cheap, adaptable, fun, and the community is one of the largest and most friendly out of any game I have ever played. You will get stuck onto certian servers of TTT, Murder, or just sandbox by yourself testing out everything and possible having 179 addons (Well, yeah, thats my highest amount of addons at one time, but its a lot shorter now) at the same time, testing Hatsune Miku NPC's to hitting them in the face with the Gaben Hammer. This game is a hot mess, but that's the way everyone likes it, because in Garrys Mod, literally, anything is possible. And the community cement that fact in very well. That is why I have sunk over 550 hours into this game, and it is worth every penny, and is a precious jewel of the gaming library. Most of my friends on Steam I have met through this game, and they are all awesome, like this game. If you don't have this game, seriously, GET IT RIGHT NOW. You are missing out on a whole bunch of fun. So, why are you waiting looking at the reviews? Come on, get it already! 10/10
Yolo Gamer Z;-;it's f**ken awsome pose ragdolls download maps roleplay sandbox
MonkeyKun;-;This game let me know every friends from each country ;)
R|c|G SlendySloth;-;endless possibilities and you can do what ever you want when you feel like like it
Wizard;-;Garry's mod is one of the games i have played the most. Its one of those games that never gets old because it always has some amazing things you havent downloaded yet! If you are looking for fun you should really buy this game because it has a lot of different fun addons and gamemodes.
Segaco;-;after 1 year of playing (i know i have 400 hours, but i played alot in that time) i lost my interest on this game 3 years ago, i had no money, i pirated it, i wanted to create stuff in sandbox. 2 years later, i had more money, so i bought it as my birthday present, in this game i found an aweasome community that turned into sh*t, but i met ppl there, 87% of the ppl i have as friends, are from this game. ttt is my favourite gamemode, thats how i found "Town of Salem". also, if u want a game like ttt, with roles AND free, try it, it will be on steam shortly if u like sandbox, cmon and try this. if you know how to code lua stuff, do something and post it on the workshop. if u want to make friends in a community, just search a server, and try
cubic orange;-;i love this game over 544 hours played much wow
Bowser Koopaling;-;I bought this game when it was for sale in February. Didn't care how much it was. I just wanted it so bad! So then i bought it and have had a ton of laughter since then. Why are you reading my comment when you can buy the game and have fun?!
Pacnet;-;You'll always play this game once in a while to build weird and interesting things and pose people funnily. I would recommend this game to anyone. You'll never regret buying this game especially if you enjoy games such as Blockland.
Fresh Prick Of Bel Air;-;One of my favorite games, hours of fun! Lots of gamemodes!
Tyrone;-;cheaper then crack
Yes, This is Phone;-;Great for: Late nights, Morons, Borderline  children, you, your mom, porn stars, your dead twin, Gordon freeman, why are you reading this, the man in the yellow hat, simon belmont, Link, Buy this damn game, and your money. All these people approve of gmod, buy it now and give valve money Feed The Gaben

Sir Viap von Doppler;-;Best game in the whole world, I have played it for a few years now and it never gets boring. I have more Garry's Mod Playing Hours then i've got Sleeping Hours, for real... No Joke.. Seriously. GMOD 4 EVER! <3
Cali <3;-;Everyone tried to warn me that once I started playing this game I would become addicted. Did I listen? Lol no =) Gmod definitely has some of the best communities I've ever been a part of. Besides amazing people who play, the gamemodes- especially TTT are so much fun. There is so much creativity involved in this game and I love how people never stop trying to make the game better and better. I would definitely recommend this game.
b0nk;-;A truly unique game where you can build many things and activate them. Other modes besides building things, this is extremely fun!
MLGIlluminatiMeerkat;-;I mean look at my hours. (btw buy the valve complete pack aswell)
Terra;-;This game deserves a 10/10. Build anything, play with friends, and best of all, WEAPONS! ADDONS! ETC! Worth every penny

Fryro the Pie-ro;-;Would rate 1000000000/10. Very satisfying sandbox mode, along with a game where, along with others, you play a very werewolf like trust game, a game where you can pick up cans, cars, computers, and even a cow and turn into them, and many other literally endless gamemodes to enjoy. Reccomended server: Creepy's villa TTT
Toffee Samurai;-;This game..it's not just a sandbox game..no it's a new world where you can become a murderer and stab people just because, it's a place where you can be a detective trying to solve a murder which the murderer is right next to you waiting to shoot you in the head when you turn away, its a place where people turn into objects to hide from murdererous hunters trying to kill them....This is no game...It's a new life , a new world all for you to make change and live in...Just remember to have a clock around and you will understand how somebody can waste as much time I have in this game Thanks for reading My rating- 100/100 :D
NSKShadow;-;10/10, would spend life playing again.
banniiii;-;Millions of gamemodes, hours and hours of fun with friends, on public servers or even alone. A billion ways to play it, a billion ways to have fun. Tons of popular source-mods combined. Best played with a couple of friends!
Hitler is Canadian;-;Garry's Mod is an experience no doubt, an amazing experience. There are no goals in Garry's Mod other than have fun. Whether that be through the antics of TTT or the hilarity of Prophunt, i guarantee this game will have something that appeals to you. Absolutley everything is player driven, Game modes, Weapons, Maps, Props, and just about anything else you will ever want will be in this game. 11/10 would play again. P.S. Do yourself a favour and buy the damn game already, you will not be dissapointed.
TBA ThunderBrain;-;So many mods, so little time
_ReThInK;-;One of the best games on steam
FliegenderHamster;-;Awesome game, infinite possibilitys. You can build tanks, drones, spaceships(or whatever) and even code them. Workshops fine too. Not to forget, gamemodes(for the bad builders) and updaates ! :D I can only recommend this game for people who like shooters/rp/sandbox games.
2sBs;-;No game can exactly compare to Gmod. It is incredible. You can do so much and it is so fun. Whether you are sandboxing or playing Trouble in Terrorist Town, you will have lots of fun. This game has many pros. For starters, the incredible physics engine of Source combined with a sandbox game makes for some fun times. This game can be used for making animations, by spawning in ragdolls and positioning them where you want, and finally snapping a picture. You also get a lot for your $10 worth. Not only do you get sandbox (which is fun in itself) but you also have other games by the modding community build for Garry's Mod. These are games such as Stop it Slender, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt and many more. However, this game isn't perfect. This game has a few minor cons that are worth talking about. Firstly, if this is your first Steam purchase, or your first Source game purchase, you may run into a few problems. See, you need to buy a Source engine game. While that wasn't an issue for me (I personally got Steam for Portal once, now I use it much more) others may find themselves not being able to play GMod. Secondly, many of the games require Counter-Strike: Source. This was a problem for me, because I didn't want to pay $20 for CSS. I was able to get the textures off the internet (legally!) and mod my game so this was fixed, however many users may not want to do this. Finally, when you first play this game, you may have no idea what it is exactly, and just play Sandbox, which can get very boring. There's no guide or help to tell you there's anything else to do. To summerise, GMod is a great game that will keep getting better as it is updated and as the community of modders and other Workshop creators alike grows. However, because of some minor issues, this game deserves an 8.3 out of 10. I recommend this game, and you should definately buy it.
Joshuacn;-;did not get it at first but now its EPIC.
skullhead51;-;Really nice sandbox with lots of replayability. Just make sure you have counter-strike: source before getting this.
Supercalmania;-;I highly recommend you buy this game. It only costs $10.00. This can be used well if you want to mess around build contraptions, or film (Machinima) or RP. You can do pretty much anything in Garry's mod.
Rambonxious Puppy;-;This game is AMAZING!!! It's what you get when you inject minecraft with steroids. The Description Doesn't tell about the hundreds of gamemodes other gamers have created. And the more source games you have installed, the more props and textures you have too. Epic. 10/10
winteR;-;This is literally one of the best games ever made! There is so much to do in this game. Firstly, there is the community created content which is amazing, secondly, there is the content supplied by the creator which lets you do so much, and thirdly, there are a ton of gamemodes to play with your friends! This is well worth your $10 and eveyone should get it! MUST HAVE!
Apollo;-;great game get it now!
Plads;-;This game has the easiest mod insallation the best maps the best Npc and the best quality of any sandbox game to date i love this game every one should have it and will enjoy it
loveless;-;Garry's Mod (GM) is a virtual world developed by Linden Lab launched on June 23, 2003, and is accessible on the Internet. A free client program called the Viewer enables its users, called Residents, to interact with each other through avatars. Residents can explore, meet other residents, socialize, participate in individual and group activities, and create and trade virtual property and services with one another, or travel throughout the world (which residents refer to as "the grid"). Garry's Mod is for people aged 16 and over.

[OPTIC]DrPhil<ToysRus.org>;-;See now when you buy this game THAT is when you can start livin like larry
Dank Beef Memes ThePlebKing;-;This game is amazing i would recommend this to anyone! Honestly i would call this game the "King Of Games" because all the gamemodes (E.g Sandbox, Prophunt, TTT, and Dark Rp is fun too. But all im saying is that this game is the best! :).
Nahgola;-;This game is amazing. 11/10
JackRuby'sAss>>LLF<<;-;Bowl of Gravy
Kawaii As Fuck;-;10/10 Was stabbed in the  by Spongebob while an 11 year old told me why I'll always suck and how he would beat me up. Gameplay was great.
Bob [HD];-;this is a nice game for fun and building.
Red Wing;-;it's ok
Mr. Bojangles;-;Awesome game other than the fact it requires TF2, CS:S, and HL2 To get the full experience. Its great to see people coming up with all these creative modes / mods!
Ghost_ | Alex;-;Super game, super fun on all servers ... but if you like this and find a greate server you will sped all day on Gmod!
Compsognathus;-;really fun to play
Verrick;-;Some of the best fun any PC gamer can have. I can't even really define it either, there's many layers to Garry's mod. You gotta see it yourself.
Mew2Prince;-;A must; this game is amazing. This game is full of fantastic content (as long as you buy it with Counter Strike Source), such as Prop Hunt, Murder and lots of other addictive games! I would definately recommend this game to everyone!
Lethal;-;This game is Extremely fun and it has absolutely no end to it. Download models guns and alot of other stuff from the steam workshop aswell as goof around with friends on your own personal server. even play hundreds of different gamemodes like Murder, DarkRP, Trouble in Terrorist Town, and many more, Definately worth the buy!
YekoD;-;Enjoyable all the time anywhere for anyone
Overheating Lilith;-;BEES. KNEES. this game is totally potatomunchtasticals. I like building things And blowing people up Poos and wees, Stop typing.
Wolf;-;great game and stuff.
Jos;-;THE BEST GAME
rybo :D;-;If you have Steam, you must have this game! Endless possibilites.
Birthday Vitzel;-;You can be a melon. 10/10
[HLDME] God of Hellchickens;-;Awesome. You're given the ablility to spawn couches, barrels, zombies, whatever, some guns, and a gun that allows you to sticks things together and such. You're given tools to do something and left to do it. Theres no way to win, except in your own mind when you build a giant base or car. Addons make the world open up more, allowing you to pose better, build epic machinery, play something different, kill those zombies in a creative way. Multiplayer only adds to the havoc, allowing you to collabarate on bases and killing machines. Save your stuff to view later. Multiple gamemodes make the game even MORE exciting. Only one downside: except on some good servers, the community is comprised of spammers, trollers, spawn campers, and overall idiots. Of course, when that happens you dupe in your autokill machine and give them a taste. Summary: GMod is love. GMod is life. GMod is awesome. Now to find a Goat Sim gamemode. >:D Later, -Reco
[RYSE] Vapor;-;Very fun game with a lot to do never gets borring. Played for 10 hours today. I'd recomend DarkRP Murder and Trouble in Terrorist Town. Those are just some of the hundreds of diffrent custom game modes that come with this game. There is only one flaw to this game. You have to buy two games to be able to play this. You have to buy counter strike source, Team Fortress 2 and including Garry's Mod itself. Im not saying that those games are bad im just saying it would be nice to have it all together than just buyinh two seperate games. And yes ik that there is a bundel that includes Conter-Strike Source and Garry's Mod but it is still two seperate games. But Overall this is an amazing game and will always be one of my favorite games to play.
aunt joemima;-;This game is
TheReiChannel;-;Great Game. I would give it 20 stars out of 5.
MrCreeperKinz;-;Very good deal, its very cheap and addons are easy to install just click install addon and your done

BigBadAud999;-;cool
Tempest777;-;great game
25 de mayo;-;This game is very fun and you can do anythink.I recomend this game.
ExonautPrime;-;This is one of the best games you can get on steam curently if you love building mods and tons of weaponry and vehicles it can be used with many other games .Totaly recomend it to anyone .
C-trane;-;If you are looking for a multiplayer game with game modes and possibilities you cant find anywhere else, this is the game for you. Garry's Mod is the one of the only games that is simple and easy, yet keeps you wanting to play. From your first traitor win in Trouble in Terrorist Town, to your first death kill in Death run, youll continue to come back. Strongly recommend.
World's Fastest Redneck;-;It's very fun. You can play Trouble in Terriost Town, Garry's Mod Tower, Prop Hunt, or Single Player mode.
[GDC]Splatman55;-;Insanely brilliant, brilliantly insane.
Polar;-;Garry's Mod, all I got to say is that it was worth it. A great timewaster. Online is extremely fun. Single player is amusing due to player created content. I really recommend this game to anyone thinking of purchasing.
Lui.aBossunAFK;-;Gmod Is not only a sandbox game is also a: FPS, Horror, Puzzle, non-sence, Addon compatible, mistery and more. Gmod is just perfect... 10 out of muthering 10
Mard;-;Garry's Mod is been started since 2005. Now update after update. It became Gorgeous. Even More. Even some more that I can ever imagine. With the workshop, its a whole lotta better. Its a better, cheaper version than Minecraft. I have not much words to say. Final Verdict - +Garry looks good +Workshop makes it whole lotta better +Cheaper and better version of Minecraft -Please don't sue me Joe.
ian07123;-;why are you still looking at that buy button, you should give it a press then your mind will be exploded with happiness
RichBoundless;-;Still better than call of duty ghosts.
Koreaboo;-;Awesome game with tons of addons and mods and is only $10.00 FREAKIN GOOD DEAL!
mats442;-;Nice game. Many different gamemodes. Buy it if you don't have it!

Vixon;-;Spawn watermelons 10/10
Kaiser (the circumsoldier);-;I logged in to a jail server when i first got this years ago. needless to say a bunch of pre-pubescent 11 year olds forced me in to the shower where they each took turns  me. after they were all done the dragged my body into a soccer field and played soccer with it 10/10 would get  again
Casavant;-;I think this game is amazing.
Mr. Kendev;-;Escape Pedo Bear gamemode, 10/10 would play again
Jewish Nigar;-;This game is the best game I've played in a long while, this game can go from building things to trying to find who's that shoebox jumping around.
Hexygon;-;Garry's Mod is a very creative and fun game. I find it different from any game really. Garry's Mod Vanilla lets you build contraptions and structures out of props from Valve liscensed games. And for people who think that isn't enough, there are about 50+ gamemodes to choose from, and who knows how many addons and duplications there are to download from the Steam Workshop. Garry's Mod, in my opinion is very good game, only contridicted by the occasional squeaker noobs that mic spam.
Cerebrum or Anima;-;This game is just AWESOME !!
[PG:M] Donutz;-;This is a very good game w/ alot of gamemodes and l recommend it to almost Everyone :D
GameZILLA4g;-;This game really makes me want to  cats.
ChubbyNinja;-;I personally only play Garrys Mod for trouble in terrorist town XD but i've play other thing like zombie survival and......stufff.But you guys should seriously consider buying this game. :)
TaiM;-;GREAT GAME MODS MAKE IT EVEN BETTER
Rusky Petrovsky;-;Much fun has been had.
Shuler;-;A fun game that breaks a lot.
Doomguy;-;I guess i've played this long enough to give it a review. The game is pretty amazing. It uses the source engine so you don't need a beefy computer to play it. The game modes are just amazing. Im guessing most of you came here because of youtubers (Seananners, Venturian, DasBo, Ect.) so here are a list of a bunch of gamemodes that im sure you have seen on youtube: TTT (Trouble In Terrorist Town) Sandbox Hide & Seek Prop Hunt There are lots more gamemodes then this, but those are the ones im sure you will play first. Remember to pick up Counter- Strike:Source if you are going to play any of the gamemodes because most servers require CSS. The Modding community will rarely ever take a break so if your looking for a cool Addon- You've found the right place! Most Source games will work on Gmod. Including: Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode 1 & Episode 2, Left For Dead, Ect. Pros and Cons +Lots of players and servers +Tons of Mod Support +Friendly (for the most part) Community +All kinds of Gamemodes +Super computer not needed to run Garry's Mod + Lots of fun to play with friends -Lots and lots of kids - Lots of time will be sucked out of you -The odd person that is a total arsepick to everyone (AKA "The Spammer" or "The RDMER") Well that is my review. REMEBER TO BUY CSS BEFORE PLAYING GMOD IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER!!! 8.5/10
Skware;-;Great game, buy it on sale though. If you can't wait, then buy it anyways. Defff worth the hours of fun and trolling.
Alb_Lord_of_Bats;-;I RDMed a squeaker. He got banned. 11/10
Blade-On Holiday Back On 20/7/15;-;Best game ever!!!!!!!! THIS REALLY IS THE BEST GAME EVER, ENDLESS POSSIBLITYS, JUST AMAZING! A valve must have!
Spa Sapping;-;did you ever wondered, what its like to control, look, kill, play a fictional character ? or just even ragdoll it all over the place? whatever the character is, this game have it all, you can find every possible thing in the world in the workshop, you dowload it for free, and bam you do whatever you like to do with it in Gmod, not just characters, famous weapons, maps, locations, vehicles, mods, gamemods, everything you know, you can bring it alive in this game. its pure sandbox, you do the rules, you play, you kill everybody, you spare everybody, you torture anybody, WHATEVER is in your mind, ITS HERE. in this game everything is possible. 10/10 pure recomended.
Dorramu;-;Gmod is a fun game with lots of different game modes. So if you love sanbox, mystery and action this is the game for you!
Pel at E3;-;Great game, a lot of room for imagination. Don't expect the community to show off many brain cells though.
CancoZ;-;Excellent game! Everyone must have it! So many things to do!
VODKAH;-;It's ok.
AstroDolphinz;-;Got a group together on DarkRP and mugged people for compliments. 10/10.

Rogue Cheney [Away on Holiday];-;If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob a bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.
Hans;-;i wish i had more time to try this game out altered roleplay is the best community ever tho
Star_Hawk_;-;Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway. "Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm... _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more. _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore. _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds. _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want. _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10 Overall 8.5 Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod -Star_Hawk_

Valiantttt;-;Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.
Hoffa;-;You don't log 6000+ hours in a bad game if you get what I mean. http://youtube.com/Hoffa1337
FB||Gillan_Greenleaf | KinguWIN;-;When I first bought this, my friend said "not a game, bro." He was right. It's not a game. It is your world. Do with it what you wish.
Shark Bait;-;You can spawn watermelons. 10/10
orane;-;An amazing game. Truly the first game with infinite free DLC. With millions of maps and plenty of gamemodes, Its a win.
Chaz;-;this game is all about you and your creative mind and creating things. you can build towns a man hold something or just a flying . oh and that is just sandbox. there are MILLIONS of diffrent gamemodes to choose from. like TTT hide n seek DarkRP and melon bomber.
M1k3yd33t;-;Run away. Run away before it consumes you. You never leave this game. You never leave. 11/10 would be consumed again
Yoko;-;this is one of the funnest ing games ever and you know why? it basically breaks the laws of physics so buy this game and you will be throwing props everywhere!
Baz_Mx22;-;Games awesome so fun
darkness;-;its funny and innaproiate at the same time
RaidenPursuit;-;Garry's Mod is an interesting tool that uses many different mechanics and is unlike any other sandbox game i played before but if you play with friend the fun continues with many different gmes modes such as Sandbox, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Zombie Survival and more. The game has another interesting factor such as downloading various games on steam and using them on Gmod like Team Fortress 2, Counter Strike and lots of other games as well.
Pikaschu;-;This is a game where it gives you endless Opprotunitys to make Anything Come True! A sand box, Zombie Survival Ect You can do Anything Build Create Mods Saves Demos Ect Its Really fun In my Opinion. I Recomend This game Alot im on it Every Day you Wont Regret It. Save Memorys! After You Buy it You will be on it 24/7 Over Thousands Of mods Game modes Saves Demos Maps Cars Guns Ect Ect. This is a game Any Energized Fun communic person will play.
Nokillings;-;A game to play with your friends. It has a great multiplayer aspect you can't get out of another game. Hundreds of gamemodes from betraying your friends in Trouble in Terrorist Town to building a sled and beating random people online in Sled Race. This game has hundreds and hundreds of hours of fun and you won't be disappointed. This is a sandbox game made for everyone and their mother! Ten dollars is a steal for this game and it is one of the best game you will ever play.
TheBulginator;-;I LOVE GARRY'S MOD! I think that it's one of the greatest game ideas and I'm just wondering what it has in store for the future.
FALLOUTCANO FOURZOLS;-;What do you want to do? Don't bother thinking, just blurt it out. Right, I don't even know what you just half-said half-slurred at your computer screen just now, but I bet you $10 you can do it in this game. Speaking of $10 that's how much this games costs. Funny how that works. Wait wait, hold on to your  - you own Episode 2? You got EP2  in here. Portal 1? Portal . Ever played TF2? It's in here. HL2?  you don't even need to own that one, it's in here. Got a favorite Sourcemod? Most of the popular ones are available to use in here. Now don't let go of those  yet. That's not everything you can possibly have. I'd rattle it all off but I'm convinced that the list would take up a whole gigabyte of Steam's server space. Yes. A whole gigabyte. Of plain text. That's a lot of . GOD DAMN IT YOU LET GO OF YOUR BOOBS DIDN'T YOU. I didn't even get to the part about how the community is constantly making more, ...as well as the fact that there are umpteen gazillion tools PRIMARILY for MAKING YOUR OWN DAMN  INGAME.
xTcR | RetroTinfoil [IA|;-;really fun and intative
Seductive Sonic;-;A hilarious game that uses the same engine as HL2,you can download add-ons to make it more funner,and use them to annoy your friends,whom will probably see errors,overall,one of the best games I've ever played,especially if you're angry,this game is a good reliever,plus it's on sale ALL the time!
-Kn0x-;-;Awesome game very fun
TheUncutJew;-;Garrys Mod is one of the most fun yet fuked up games yet!!!
whisperrybowl228;-;awsome game
Monstercjr;-;Within the first week of owning it, I had spent hours playing the game. Even though I am no good at it, it took me awhile to decide wether to buy it or not, but it is worth it. It is really the only game with infinite possibilities.
Gravekeeper;-;It is fun.... buy it
Club Penguin Ft. Hitler DLC;-;hey so this game is a game that was originally a mod that wasn't on steam it was a mod for HL2 and now the game on steam uses hl2 textures to mod itself so the modding is moddific. modception. 9/11
Supercalmania;-;I highly recommend you buy this game. It only costs $10.00. This can be used well if you want to mess around build contraptions, or film (Machinima) or RP. You can do pretty much anything in Garry's mod.
MovingNonstop;-;In a game there is another game and in that game there is another whatever. Its the best game you can't get bored of Gmod
The Frosty_Engine;-;Pros: It's EPIC! Cons: Garry broke it yet again even more!!
Forte;-;This game have everything you need and want to have fun and to make your own fun with friends. Only way you can get bored of this game and not enjoy it, if you don't have a creative mind.
Osbornia;-;>Buy Garry's mod >Join random Server >Get into a lightsaber fight with a 13 year old >lose >Proceed to reconsider your career as a professional Jedi 10/10
Puinguin (Hearth Addict);-;I love this game
Antz;-;It's an... okay game I guess, not really my type though.
DANI;-;It's in my opinion, the only game that people can make friends very easily from different aspects of life spanning multiple countries. Most of my friends on my list are from GMOD and I am honored to know them. Pretty much you can do anything on here, nuff said.
Cyberpunk Cowboy;-;I have been stuck in the game for 2 years, help.
Chowders;-;This game is awesome! for such a low price, you can spend hours on this game, there is so much variety. Its like a infinite game.
AustineAerolSkyeAustria;-;Fun Game with Friends. Recommended for all players!
Varneon #Miragebola;-;Full freedom to do whatever you want, create things whose only limits are your imagination and physics engine.
[CBZ] The Sheep Man;-;I like going on DarkRP servers and propkilling for no good reason and Going on random servers and being called a squeaker and getting kicked and going on the CBZ server with my freinds. 11/10 would do it all again
Nickman!;-;I've played this game for about 1500 hours now. It never gets boring. The fact that you can do literaly everything that you could possibly imagine blew my mind back when i started playing it and it still does today. There are so many mods and creations it would take you years to look through all of them and the diffrent gamemode are also really fun to check out. This game will make you say :" Dang and i payed 50 bucks for for flippin Call of duty?! " I'll give it 10/10 Stars because there is literaly nothing like it out there and the only end of the game is the end of your own imagination...and knowledge about the source hammer tool.
Nixel;-;All I can say is: BUY. THE. GAME. Actually, that's not all I can say. That would be too much to list here. But I can assure you that at least 85% of the things I could say are positive! Maybe 87%. 90% maybe? I won't go higher than that, though. But I digress. One negative thing is, there's too many glitches. Although most are caused by the community. Which is generally great, though. Definitely worth the money, but it might still be best to wait until it goes on sale. It goes on sale so frequently that that shouldn't take too long. But I digress again. I think I'm gonna make 'I digress' my motto. Dammit, I digress again ! Just put it on your wishlist already!
RhiPlays;-;I have REALLY enjoyed playing this game - Hence the amount of time I have played on it. It is a great game with many different gamemodes/mods to play on e.g Murder, Prophunt, DarkRP and the list goes on... and on! I would highly recommend this game it's not too expensive and is definitely worth it! This game is very silly and fun at the same time XD
if ur reading this then ur dead;-;a hilariously fun sandbox game made by the same people who made HALF-LIFE 2! why is it not in ur library yet?!?

UrbanFury;-;This game is whatever you want it to be. Tons of fun.
[RG] seinsei3(Son of Shenron);-;If I was in garrys mod and the person sitting in front of the computer was controling me,I would have fallen off cliffs, got killed by the combine, killed wallace breen (cause he is a freaking idiot),and many more things that would have all been a crazy adventure! And thats what garry's mod is all about!
AlanShadow;-;One of the best sandbox games ever. The amount of mods is simply astonishing, and I wouldn't even think twice about getting certain mods. On the performance front it isn't as good however, it can be very annyoing on slower computers, and even the more powerful ones are sometimes having problems. 8/10, purely because of performance issues.
ItsMe;-;THIS GAMES IS THE MOST FUN YOU WILL HAVE ON STEAM!!!!!!!!
Zyanok;-;You can do absolutely anything to your hearts desire ^^
Alice;-;Best game ever.Best mods ever.Best-HOLY SH*T *combines shooting* ;-; oh god.

Crystal;-;Love this game. I'd recommend this game to everyone!
Dell (Box Spies) (Vacationing;-;Its the one game that keeps me playing. Its wide variety of gamemodes and all the addons make it an enjoyable experience and keeps me entertained. Being me, this doesn't happen very often, also if it wasn't a good game I wouldn't write a review for it xD.
Xtremememes;-;This game is complete poop, good poop. Like that poop you take and you're like "yeah".

Trex B055;-;i love this game it is the best game in the world to me
(((8*4)/2)+9)+5;-;pretty good
Track_Pad_Hero;-;With a little imagination you can have endless enjoyment. This is a must for anyone that owns Half Life 2, Counter Strike: Source, and Team Fortress 2. It's also a good first step for those that have ever been interested in modding. It includes a large amount of suprisingly fun spin-off mods that are powered by a community with no sign of winding down. Quite the opposite, it seems more people are playing.
[OL] Mr.Jaffa-Cake;-;This is what i call Digital Playground ! Fun Gamemodes, milions of differend addons that you can instal and have fun with. GMod is a game with a lot of games inside ! Plus the Source engine makes it more Fun :D

wawa;-;LULZ game. If you want a game for laugh the entire day, this is the game! the best part is you bought for the game and get more than 300 games and if you are annoyed in the mode you're playing just download and play other mode.
AceFTFW;-;It's gr8.
Yukon;-;After playing for over 1,200 hours, you'll learn a few things. For Multiplayer: Multiplayer can be a wonderful experiance that will forever change you, create friendships and learn new ways to express yourself via creation. 1. Never use the Kleiner Skin 2. No how matter much you hate the map, it'll will always be there on a Server 3. Dont expect sympathy if your new, but if you are, be friendly, dont act like you just learned how to use a computer last week. 4. Somebody will always be better at building than you, but dont stop yourself from characteristic things that really say You, You Made this. This is what I am. 5. Somebody will always be more notable than you, for better or worse. 6. You'll always meet that one guy who is a master at almost everything, but akward to be around. Chances are they are an Admin 7. Servers with custom ranks are guranteed to be a little sketchy 8. More often than not, somebody will scream out DarkRP rules on your sandbox server. 9. Ever hear the phrase RDM where it doesnt belong? Note Note 8 10. All Admins have different personalities, and odds are, you cant please all of them. Stick to rules 3 and 4. 11. Admins may have a Domino effect, so try to please atleast one as a friend. 12. Quality over Quantity? Who says? 13. DONT. Be. A child. You are guranteed to get muted or hated, unless your playing on respective, child friendly servers. This means anyone under 12. 14. You could have 400 addons. But each server you join is going to have atleast 10 things for you to get. This could go on forever, rules and situations in which they'd apply. But Id reccomened Gmod for anyone looking for an experiance unlike any other.
HELLAS ASUS;-;If you want to have fun with your friends this game is ideal for you! A supreme sandbox game that I undoubtedly reccomend!
MyWizBiz;-;One of the most coolest and best sandbox games ever created!! My favorite gamemodes are Dark RP/Sandbox/TTT and Murder. This is like a game that most gamers need to actually have. So I give it a 10/10

There are many servers and many game types to choose from, and also many mods from the community workshop to make playing this game even more enjoyabe.
MadDOOM;-;One of my favourite games of all time. You can do anything in this game, the community content is really the icing on the cake with gamemodes such as TTT, Murder, Prophunt and etc. I highly recommend this game for its price!

oh jeez;-;You cant say its just one game. Well basicly it is, but there is so much to do in this game. There are multiple gamemodes community created weapons, maps,npc's. You may need to buy some other games to make it look the best [Such as counter strike:source day of defeat and so on...] But its totally worth it. Game of the year for me.

dominator7713/TradingKnife;-;best game ever games inside of a game !!!
Joel V12;-;Now garrys mod really gets me questioning my sexualality. I always thought I was a hetro sexual type of transvestite (even though I always had a crush on Edward Cullen... but who doesn't?) But when I first spawned G-man and Gordan Freeman together, it made be so aroused that I started to make a famous series of gay porn called 'G-man's G-Spot' which can be found on {LINK REMOVED} bestgore.com. This really has ruined all my relationships in my life which is why I have to give this game a 0.5 out of 10.
Dr. Zeus;-;really fun to screw around in :P
Burritobane43;-;Best time to be had given with friends involved.
Plague;-;Make dongs and slap it on the workshop 10/10

DLqGamerssassin;-;Not sure if got addicted to this game or left the game on during all this time
Kato;-;Great game! I have a lot of fun playing this game with my friends!
Rizz97;-;Garrys Mod is a very fun game.. Theres no story behind it and for a game like this it works. There are some minor glitches that break immersion at times 7/10
PixieWillow;-;With the variety of games and player-base thanks to the community surrounding it, Garry's mod is one of the most fun sandboxes I have ever played. There are still a few issues with the game itself, but once you work around them (given that they haven't been fixed) the entirety of the game is a ball of enjoyment that one would happily waste hours of their lives on. Would recommend to any casual gamer who's looking for a laugh.
Lord Gaben;-;Fun in any gamemode, especially sandbox. (If you want to do random stuff.)
Echo;-;I would buy this game have had so much fun playing it with my friends, so many gametypes to choose from.
x3j50;-;i really like this game....it suites my creativity and i give it a "recomended for creative people"
Me Gusta;-;This game is awesome you can do anything you want i mostly play this game to make a photo
NinjaWulv [MMCH];-;Garrys Mod. Ahh, the game that has so much. From base gamemodes to workshop creations, there is something for anyone and everyone in this game. This game has more content than the newest 12GB game. I would reccomend this game to anyone.
Headcrabs;-;The Amount of hours i have played in this game should explain how much i love it :D
Killerwolf;-;Love this game
andrewmallett;-;some much fun especially the multiplayer
Toxic_Ro0ster;-;always the best game
SpY;-;One Of the Funiest Games Ever Made. If you are thinking about buying this game for $10, Do It. It will be the most fun You will have with a video game, Especaily if you have friends who can play with you. Wether It's TTT or Elevator: Source, I will always look up to this game. Good job Garry Newman. Well Played.
Doomguy1237;-;This review is very short. Garry's Mod is not a game. It is a physics toy and sandbox style tool. In Gmod, you can reluctantly do whatever you want to. You can: build things such as cars, buildings, bunkers, airships, boats, or whatever you can think up, use weapons from other valve games, as well as add-on weapons created by other people, play with physics, kill NPCs with literally anything, drive a world of vehicles, paint, destroy stuff, spawn props, spawn ragdolls to pose and beat up, make a machinima for use on Youtube or other video websites, listen to music, and MUCH MUCH more. There are addons to download, like maps and player models. The maps can vary from Counter Strike to Team Fortress, Portal to Garry's Mod, and Day Of Defeat to Left 4 Dead. A very addicting toy from Team Garry.
JeffHardddyyy;-;Okay, If you like creative on Minecraft you'll love this
Kinky Unicorns;-;Great
2-D;-;This game is slowly... slowly... taking my life away... RUN WHILE YOU CAN!!!
[SC] MrTart;-;you can do what ever you want :D awsome!!!

Aporia326;-;>Playing on DarkRP server >Get kidnapped by some people and their admin friend >Die >Admin brings me back > I g2g grab dinner, brb- I disconnect >Permabanned by the admin friend > Admin friend won't unban me even with my appeal 11/10 would get banned again
Vaskez;-;Despite its release date, this is still one of the best games out there, where only your imagination is the limit to what you can do. The base game is sandbox with Half-Life 2 weapons and it supports models from most Source engine games such as Counterstrike Source, Team Fortress 2 and Left for Dead 2. New features aswell as modifying exisiting ones can be done through modding, and the language used in the mods is lua, which is very easy to pick up on and learn.
Test;-;This game has provided me with hours upon hours of enjoyment. Highly recommend this game.
Sif;-;2 Gb installation folder is a lie.
Lora is a Lora;-;Nice game.
Jol;-;UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY!!! I've had way too much fun with this game. Theres always new content since the Workshop and it has great multiplayer with many options. This game is a STEAM ESSENTIAL
Jumpppy.;-;I only played around 1 hour and a half and I must say that I never had so much fun in a game in such a little game time like on GMod. I'm LOVING this game, I'm just... LOVING IT! I had so much fun playing Murderer.. you can't even imagine! Awesome game, very cool, funny & entertaining, and if you play it with friends it'll be even cooler! Awesome game, for real. It's cheap, it's fun and it is cool. I'd rather buy this game then DayZ (look at my analisys of it). Gotta rate this game 10/10! It's just... superb, I'm speechless with this game.
Felix Shay Nixer;-;Journal, day 44. I'm a potato in the jar. They still don't suspect anything. 14/10 would be potato again
Lightning Reborn;-;Can spawn chairs 10/10
Majora;-;HOLY FU**ING !? YOU STILL HAVENT BOUGHT THIS GAME!? WHAT THE HE*L IS WRONG WITH YOU!? ITS LIKE -50% YOU DUMBA**! GET IT BEFORE I SMACK THE FU** IUT OF YOU YOU MORONIC INBRED!
Dr. Heavy;-;legit game 10/10 would play again totes recommend ye ok
RYNO MAN;-;"What is it?" is probably the most frequently asked question about G-Mod. This ever changing game has left many with that question unanswered. Today we seek to have that question answered. Today we will leave that question unanswered. Welcome to Garry's Mod. I suppose I should start with the gameplay. That is just the unique thing about G-Mod though. It has no one set gamemode. The whole point of G-Mod is to test, create, and try out the many different gamemodes you can download from the Steam Workshop. They are fun and there is a great variety to chose from. The game also comes with two preloaded gamemodes. Trouble in Terrorist Town and Sandbox. Sandbox is basic build/do whatever you want gamemode, while Trouble in Terrorist town is a murderer/detective style gamemode. Both are fun and intuitive. The sandbox gamemode gives you more freedom, but has a bit of a larger learning curve. The Trouble in Terrorist Town gamemode is a bit more for those who are accustomed to games like Unreal Tournament or Counter-Strike. I personally prefer playing on the Sandbox gamemode as it allows you to build anything you want via the tools provided within the Source Engine. You might still be wondering: "What exactly do you do in Garry's Mod?" Well to answer your question, just about anything you want! That is what makes Garry's Mod so amazing...the freedom limited by unlimited boundaries. Now as for the graphics. They are good. The Source Engine does an excellent job of creating a beautiful, fluid, and realistic world. For being an engine almost 10 years old it still does not falter in it's quality. The sound is anything but a disappointment. It is loud, powerful and moving. Because this is primarily a Sandbox game it gives the user freedom to add on their own sounds or sound effects from the workshop. I cannot tell you how many times I have been playing on some kind of a Horror Map and the key element was the loud and pulsing sound. A screech coming from behind, sounds like a real screech from behind. Ok, now for Lasting Appeal. Ummmm...hmmmm. About as unlimited and ongoing as you want it to be. Simple as that. All in all, this is a great game for Minecraft lovers (14 and up :) and Source Engine developers alike. Why? Well...cause it's G-Mod of course! And what is that exactly? Well, let's not go down that road... Overall Rating: 8/10 Presentation: 9/10 Multiplayer: 6/10 Gameplay: 7.5/10 Graphics: 7/10 Sound: 8/10 Lasting Appeal: 10/10 Overall Rating: 8/10
Dan;-;Let me see, 47gb of shizzle I've downloaded from the workshop because of this game. Want a game that is customizable, fun, different and allows you to play so many games inside a game, this is it! Only had this game since November 2013 (7 months), and already have 1200hrs and climbing!
SnipeAF;-;10/10 I would personaly say game of the games you could have so much fun with friends Buy it do everything to get it (^_^)
ShaneThomass;-;Great game. nice to meet and play with people around the world. A great laugh.
Conor3D;-;Great game, you never run out of things to do!
NinjaHawk;-;Funny SandBox Fun Its Just GMOD BUY IT NOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!
Drunken_Pickles;-;I modded batman into best buy... 11/10
Radical Mac;-;Garry's Mod. One of the biggest time wasters. One of the most played games on Steam. One game with a large quantity of players. It is also a game that I have grown to love and learn new things as that pertain to building/creating in the game. As well I have met many players in many servers, gotten plenty of friends, and my Garry's Mod Journey still continues...
awesomeiceman;-;wtf is this... iv never played a wierder game amazing
Baxie;-;Cons: DarkRP is normally filled with minges and kids who don't even know what the hell to do TTT is filled with RDMers and kids who think its some kind of form of Counter-Strike Sandbox is... No, Just dont go to Sandbox Pros: If your lucky enough and you find a server with a good community the game becomes instantly needs some kind of ing Oscar or Emmie
ScrubLord420;-;so fun and awesome cant ever wait to play it !!! better than most games
Bardarlands;-;a very good game
Junkatastrophic;-;I strongly recommend you to buy this awesome game! It's a lot of fun to play!
Count Bob;-;Good for messing around and a good game to play in your spare time
(._. );-;It's ok. Get it if it is on offer.
Timmi;-;IT IS THE HISTORRY OF THE OLD AND NICE GAMES WITH NEW STUFF TO ENJOY IT !!!!
Dragoboss;-;I just mainly love how this game is practically limitless. Basically, dev's can create their own gamemodes and scripts, modelers can create their own models, etc, etc. Everyone can customise this game. Which is awesome. I love some of the gamemodes that are available for this too, mainly Prop Hunt. GarrysMod is simply a great game!
LaDDence;-;Garry's mod is a fun game with construction, shooting and prop hunt? Totally worth 10 dollars and I give it a over all rating of 9.5/10
sonicsasha;-;I play this game almost every day because it is so awesome.
[Celty]-Connorbeaz;-;This game is awesome. The only problem is, is that you need CSS but the the is great. Its an awesome game that is worth the money for 100% safe and trustful. Anyone out there who is thinking of not getting this game then rethink cause it is a really great game and youll have fun with it
TEEM ROKIT |LAB|;-;Best sandbox ever created lets you do your hearts desire nothing can hold your creativity back
The Fancy As Helvete Rabbit;-;This game is fun to play around and have fun with yourself or with others you build and also fight! i definitly think this is the best game ive played on steam and if you get board get more addons their free and fast
Fairuz #BalikKampung;-;Best game + Free addons
LancerG2 | My fucking internet..;-;A true Garry's Mod player does posing, animations, building, playing Dark RP and zombie survival. A true Gmod player plays on an online sandbox and keeps to himself but respects others, A true gmod player uploads good dupes and saves, a good gmod player makes workshop content. If you've ever been called a mingebag/minge or have called a minge a "clone" or only played past gmod 12, spawn dupes on servers or makes  sexual themed dupes or play's TTT, or Prop-hunt, you're likey to be a massive thundercunt who should GTFO and go find a completely new game. I do reccomend this game because the amount of good players there are out there seemingly just make the experience a whole lot better. Don't worry about the  mingebags.
Master Wolf;-;I have no life anymore.
[Baklava]TattaSlayer38;-;Kill everyone get banned 10/10 would kill everyone again
titanica25;-;Garry's Mod is a silly fun sandbox game that allows you to make or play with lots of things. I enjoy this game a lot, especially in multiplayer. Anyone who like minecraft or roblox will love this game. Shooters will enjoy too!
Song Name?;-;First you must ask your self am i ready? You might be but then it happens! The minges, the Badmins, The annoying children that flocked there because of youtubers! But i am making this sound like a horrible game. It is not it is such a creative game but the people who play are mixed. Do you like to RP, build, kill? Well this is a game for you. Now if you came like this "Oh boy i saw seananners play this i think its called prop hunt and ttt seems like so much fun!" Then dont play because the people will tear you to the ground. Let me explain RP. its fun with friends can be even more fun with good people. But minges are everywhere so prepare for them. The worst thing your going to encounter in this game is ADMINS!! These beast are 12-16 year olds who are power hungry or are always angry if your lucky you will find the good admins. TTT: can be fun if you like mystery this is a game for you Murder is like this so it won't get a seperate thing Minges get dealt with quick But admins will perma ban you on a instant for one mistake If you are lucky you will get a good server hard to come by Prophunt: This is the most known one i believe. Haven't played much but haven't seen much badmins. Fairly simple be a prop hide and get hunted. Hide and seek is alot like this so it won't get a thing. That sums it up pretty much. Don't suspect to have fun all the time. The game can be really fun. Good luck and prepare for fun and hardship. Sincerely,Kungpow Chicken
B_udgie;-;Pros: Do what you want Alot of varied gamemodes aswell as sandbox Great game to play with friends Cheap Cons: Loading Screens Basically perfect game 10/10
a wezr;-;This is obviously approved by me. If it wasnt, then i wouldnt be typing this. I havent played much of it, but it goes without say. This game is awesome.
Proof M;-;Feels good Sand table games feel the best one
[104th]Lars11290;-;Gmod is one of the best games I've ever played if not the best, extremely enjoyable if you use some mods like ACF for example and make a tank or DarkRP. 10/10

noRktreSS (Ermac) [Road to MG];-;Garry's Mod is a modification for the 2004 game Half-Life 2. It adds features which enable the player to have a "Sandbox" experience, Sandbox being building stuff, like houses or robots. There is also a multiplayer mode where people can show off creations or battle it out with Half-Life 2 weapons. Then there is also content that can be used from other games, CSS is almost required for a good GMOD experience. The community then expand the game to add more gamemodes and other addons like new weapons or non-playable characters. Graphics can't really be judged, it's graphics are basically of 2004 standard, and since HL2 had good graphics for its time, GMOD gets good graphics too, if it was made in 2004. Graphics - 9.8 / 10 There is no story, music, artwork, or any of that. You can't say anything about this game. Now for my experience... I wasted 400+ hours that I'd never get back. 10% of it went to sandbox, trying to make animations and screwing around with NPCs and console commands. 5% went to gamemodes like Prop Hunt, or Trouble in Terrorist Town. 1% of it went to playtesting my WIP gamemode. Now, the last 84%... I spent on DarkRP. I don't like DarkRP BUT-BUT BUT BUT BUT I CAN'T STOP! I'll tell you why, going Gun Dealer just to purchase guns so I can raid the PD as Hobo, hearing the cries of children as I RDM them, arresting admins while being in a sit, it's all too fun. Stealing cars then using them in street races, Street Racing as a taxi driver, Kidnapping a police officer, Killing that police officer, Scamming people in exchange for death, Prop climbing into bases, Destroying their money printers, It's all TOO FUN. Also, you can have fun with the other 16% I spent, it's probably more worth your time. Overall, Garry's Mod gets a 9.5 / 10, it is fun and wastes all your time, it has a wide variety of gamemodes and new content always coming out. It doesn't get a full 10 because the amount of annoying children on this game is... "OVER 9000"
Stan;-;13yr-old called me a virgin  after he found out i was the traitor. 13/10
Chief Y'Trap Nomel;-;This game ruined my life. 10/10. #740+hours
Pukychz;-;Here is my story. i created a nuclear shelter consisting entirely of bananas and bricks. I then created a Semi truck inside it. Next, I spawned an army of osama bin ladens to protect me. I spawned a nuclear bomb two feet away from the bunker. I quickly entered the semi truck and hoped for the best. The osamas died. I lived 10/10
Maze;-;Garry's Mod is amazing with all the different types of gamemodes! It is totally worth the $10 it costs!
Bungus;-;I have almost 2,000 hours in this game 11/10

ePoC-ZaMuL;-;9/10 because of the missing textures :)
[IDL] Black Yoshi;-;I am the mayor of a small town. I must be honest, life here is rather odd. The hobos are planning an uprising for no apparent reason and one of them seems to be a Taliban supporter. Crime rate is sky-high here, i keep getting kidnapped for that 15 i have stached away in my bank account and the Terrorist group, "Ponysquirts.jpg", want me to remove the law that legalizes money printers and drugs. Also, there's this restaurant which also sells drugs in which sometimes people randomly light up on fire and then speak complete and utter gibberish such as "waaiiit weiaiatt mus tll u bout mikerosuhpht XL". We are also at war with the sewer demons, intent of enslaving us "surface dwellers" by slashing us with Damascus Swords. Luckily, we're able to combat them with our elite SWAT unit led by an 8 year old who is currently running around the fountain telling everyone to "RAISE YOUR DONGERS!  ". I decided to abdicate from mayorhood and look for other oppertunities. I found myself as a security guard in the theatre for my friend who had joined me on the server. I return from having a  to find out he's turned the theatre into a strip club and the cinema shows graphic, sexual anime scenes. After I saw the video "ME!ME!ME!" up on there, my life changed forever. You know those videos which are so weird and scary that you just can't explain? Yeah, this was one of those. It's even worse than Hentai. That's all I can say really. Also, hobos have taken over the bank and have turned it into "The First Church of Shrek". So, I quit my job as a security guard and became a Police Officer. My friend i mentioned earlier became a hobo and renamed his job to "Yoshi's Pet". The new Mayor (who was swag by the way) granted him permission to be in the PD and even store a printer in there. Unfortunately, it seems the rest of the police force are illiterate. They keep arresting him for being in the PD even though the mayor keeps telling them he's allowed inside. Then, on a fateful night i realise there are 5 armed men raiding the PD. I decide to take action and arrest EVERY. SINGLE. ONE OF THEM. \(^_^)/ Unfortunately, this is when things take a turn for the worst. All 5 of them start yelling "RDA" (random arrest) in the chat and the admin comes along and looks into it. He was obviously gullible enough to believe those boring sods because the next thing i know, i've been banned for a week for "Mass RDA" Oh yeah, the sandbox and trouble in terrorist modes are cool, too. 9/11 All the Admins are horny pre-teens or younger.
[cG] Blue;-;Find your Silliest friend, set up a private sandbox server, spawn the maximum number of bots and have them kill eachother while you passively throw bananas at them. The classic gamemodes to play right now are TTT, Deathrun, Murder and Prop Hunt. Noice game, thanx garry.
Roasty Mc Toasty;-;For not playing Garry's Mod much I can say it is an amazing sandbox. Not even including mods or mini games its amazing. Like others have said you can RP, do parkour, and the list goes on and on. I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes sandbox's or building. 8/10.
Hanky (   ) Perry George;-;This is a FANTASTIC game that you can build, Fight, roleplay, play with others ETC! This is worth buying and will blow your mind! I might learn how to write a guide so i can help you all! I recommend this game because it is one of the greatest games in steam made by Valve! I recommend this game, it is worth buying! GET IT NOW!

[MG] Darzaz;-;GARRYS MOD on sand box is amsing beacuase of the malleus gamming sever if it wasent for NETBLITZER to make that sever i wouldent be on garrys mod or writting this review and that is wie i thank NetBlitzer
BlitzKrieg - Back on the 27 !;-;#YOLO This, comes in mind when you think about everything you can make. Garry's mod is the ultimate sandbox game. It does crash many times because of addons, or you need some source game, other then CSS, you will usually need all source game to be sure to have every single addon to work. You can do wahtever you want, Workshop allow you to add more content to this game, which add more stuff, to maximise your experience of building, roleplaying, Ragdoll posing ( making scenes with ragolls ). You can choose to play with the game itself, the "basic" choice, or add more complex addons like Wiremod, which will introduce a kind of logic to Garry'smod, and this will allow you to make Ingame computers, Automated Contraptions, and even more like holographics fancy stuff ! 9/10 Because of the stability
mvp;-;Something is creating script errors!

[Ynot] Chibi Roka-chan~;-;At first I thought this game was trash, but during the Steam Summer Sale 2014, I bought myself and my best friend a copy of this game for $5 each, and the game was fun and hillarious!!!! Long, addicting, fun, and silly gameplay guarenteed, with lots of fun mods, maps, modes, etc. for ONLY $10!!!!!

Engineer;-;I have played this game for over 1,000 hours, (curently when posted 999, i know :P)and here is my opinion, This game is great. I would recomend this game to anyone still, this game has been through alot, and i have stuck with it for a while. This game does not really get old. The are many diffrent things to do here. However, i think this game has its limetations, and i have no clue what they are :). I hope to see many great things to come. P.S : I am very tired of seeing Five Nights at Freddys dupes. Yes we know there is a new teddy in the workshop, no need to dupe it if you must install the addon- bla bla bla. And dont get me started with the 6-10 year olds. I mean some of them are quite nice, but 9/10 times there anoying little- well there "idiots" who think the world revolves around them. somtimes i actuly request an admin to ban them just for breking one rule. I do somtimes meet friendly kids, and i reward them for being friendly. Im not going to say what it is, but they like it.thats why i hate playing multiplayer on this game on the weekends, i do somtimes, but still. I blame PewDiePie. Millions of kids want to copy him or somthing. Thanks.
seabeds;-;Great game for it's age. You can just pick it up and play. Many golden moments happen when playing; just get or make a few friends then play on a server. Many games have used gamemodes originated from here so you may be familiar. Overall very fun game.
tvilogt;-;>university roleplay gamemode ... :)
David Mihail;-;You can spawn watermelons 10/10 :)))

F3V0R;-;very differnt and very FUN GET IT
Lawlstorm;-;I think my hours played speaks for itself on this one but in case you're still not sure about whether or not to get Garry's Mod let me help you out. There are a seemingly infinite amount of ways to enjoy this game. So much content for such an incredibly low price. My personal favorite game modes are Prop Hunt and Murder. Not only is it fun to play but it's made for some excellent youtube content. The best Prop Hunt and Murder server I've been on is Lobster Build. I would definitely recommend checking out their servers when you get this game. www.lobsterbuild.com
KingCourier;-;Waisted alot of time on this game. But I would still give it an 11/10 "Would buy again" -Kingcourier
Bovril Freeman;-;10/10 would bang
Erron Black;-;This Is A Good Game Forn Role Play Action And Fun I Say
Otter of Toast;-;Do I really even need to say it? A HUGE workshop, pleanty of content and hours of building random junk, you can do almost anything, the mods are free (Thank GOD), and... Well... Gmod.
Reiska;-;its ok
such a big boy;-;i use this game to make sex scenes with anime characters
Ken Shy;-;Garry's Mod is a sandbox game. You have a wide variety of props from various Source games (depending on which you own), and multiple tools at your disposal. With these, you can build different contraptions, make vehicles, construct buildings, etc. As well as all the content included in the game, you can find a ton of mods online via the game's website or Steam Workshop. You can also make/script your own. But the fun doesn't stop there. Multiplayer is a totally different thing entirely. You can find sandbox servers and build with up to hundreds of other players, or you could dive into one of the many user created game modes. From Hide and Seek to Role Playing, there is a huge variety of unique modes to play. A few I would recommend are: Trouble in Terrorist Town. A group of 'innocent' terrorists must work with the detective(s) to discover who the traitors are and kill them. The traitors must take out the innocents, preferably without alerting anyone else. No one knows who is innocent and who is not, making for a sometimes tense experience. Morbus. A group of humans must hold out for a certain amount of time against aliens, or kill them all. There are two types of aliens: Brood aliens, and Swarm aliens. The Brood aliens get upgrades, and can transform into humans. Allowing them to get into groups and pick off people one by one. The Swarm aliens are what players spawn as when they die (assuming they were killed by another Swarm alien, or human). These have a melee and ranged attack, but no upgrades. Their role is to weaken the humans, and try to kill them. The humans have needs. Every now and then you will have to either sleep, eat, shower, or pee. You cannot move during this time, so must be wary of those around you, in case they are brood aliens. Overall one of the best game modes. A ton of fun, especially with friends. DarkRP. DarkRP is one of the more casual RP modes in Gmod. You spawn into the map as a citizen, and can choose a job to play as. From drug dealers to civil protection, there is a wide variety of roles to pick. You can go around earning money, commit crimes, buy and furnish your own house, etc. Great if you find the more serious RP servers to be boring. If you plan to buy the game, be sure you own Counter-Strike: Source too. A lot of maps use textures from CS:S, and if you do not own it you will see purple and black squares everywhere. Overall the game is absolutely brilliant. One of the very few that I can keep going back to and not get bored. One of the best purchases I have ever made.
6ty|BOOM!;-;this game is filled with opetuneties and you will liturely never get bored of playing buy this game
S3pirion (gone till the 20th);-;Dont even take time to look at the reviews, they will all say the same thing. GET THIS GAME. If your still doubting me, and want to read the reviews, fine by me, but youll just be wasting your time. GET THIS ING GAME. DO IT. THINK ABOUT DOING IT. IF YOU GET IT ON SALE ITS EVEN BETTER BECAUSE THE GREATEST, WACKIEST, BEST PHYSICS/SANDBOX/CRAZYIMULATOR2014 IS CHEAPER. Get this game. In all seriousness, please get this game. youll be glad you did.
Dragoboss;-;I just mainly love how this game is practically limitless. Basically, dev's can create their own gamemodes and scripts, modelers can create their own models, etc, etc. Everyone can customise this game. Which is awesome. I love some of the gamemodes that are available for this too, mainly Prop Hunt. GarrysMod is simply a great game!
LaDDence;-;Garry's mod is a fun game with construction, shooting and prop hunt? Totally worth 10 dollars and I give it a over all rating of 9.5/10
sonicsasha;-;I play this game almost every day because it is so awesome.
[Celty]-Connorbeaz;-;This game is awesome. The only problem is, is that you need CSS but the the is great. Its an awesome game that is worth the money for 100% safe and trustful. Anyone out there who is thinking of not getting this game then rethink cause it is a really great game and youll have fun with it
TEEM ROKIT |LAB|;-;Best sandbox ever created lets you do your hearts desire nothing can hold your creativity back

oober_;-;All you need in Gmod: Shrek ragdoll
Fairuz #BalikKampung;-;Best game + Free addons
LancerG2 | My fucking internet..;-;A true Garry's Mod player does posing, animations, building, playing Dark RP and zombie survival. A true Gmod player plays on an online sandbox and keeps to himself but respects others, A true gmod player uploads good dupes and saves, a good gmod player makes workshop content. If you've ever been called a mingebag/minge or have called a minge a "clone" or only played past gmod 12, spawn dupes on servers or makes  sexual themed dupes or play's TTT, or Prop-hunt, you're likey to be a massive thundercunt who should GTFO and go find a completely new game. I do reccomend this game because the amount of good players there are out there seemingly just make the experience a whole lot better. Don't worry about the  mingebags.
Master Wolf;-;I have no life anymore.
Yung God;-;Joined a TTT server and a 10 year old pushed me into a corner and threatened to sexually assault me. 10/10
Hipster Panda (vacation);-;this game is the best game i ever bought and i bought ALOT of games. If you got the money for the game now and you and thinking about getting it, stop thinking and get it NOW. Its just plain AUWSOME !!!

[CSUNC] Bonkaholic;-;Garry's Mod is a massive, growing game with a mostly friendly community. (There is always an occasional jerk.) Anyway, Garry's Mod is 100% worth its money: There are seemingly endless gamemodes to try! It doesn't matter what you want to do in this game, whether it's building creative things, fighting multiplayer wars inside a city, commanding a starship, or even drawing a  on the wall, you can do it! This is one of those games that if you haven't tried it out yet, you need to now!
PLA;-;Was killed by a watermelon. 101/100 would get killed by watermelon again,

DSM;-;I had to buy three other games to make this game fun. 11/10 Would buy three other games again.

user_registration_name;-;Garry's Mod is a very popular and active sandbox game, where you can build ANYTHING, and do ANYTHING, no matter WHAT you use. You can download other people's stuff in the workshop, or make your own in The Sandbox mode, one of the best, and maybe THE BEST, mode in Garry's Mod. You should be glad it's only $9.99. I got banned from a server for spawning in a rocket bathtub. 11/10. But really, get Garry's Mod.
suada gg;-;its a good game
Shock 'N Awe;-;This game is truly the new 1000 games in 1! The possibillities with this game are endless.
Mandrew the Great;-;This game has come a long way since its start as a small mod by some unknown publishers. One of the most played games on Steam, and almost always guaranteed to be on the most popular page on the Steam front page. Buy it now if you like sandbox games or just ing around with your friends!
RomneyRoundworm;-;Alot of people attack gmod because they go into it with the attitude of 'I'll join a multi-player server and ask for advice on how to play' and then they cry like a little  because either it's too confusing or people online are 'mean'. Well good for them. Garry's mod is an absolutly amazing sandbox game once you understand it and alot of people don't. If you don't have a friend to guide you like I did, then watch a youtube tutorial or something. For 6 It's fantastic what you're provided with and the amount of stuff you can do. Plus it's got something for everyone (that aren't the morons I mentioned previously). You can build whacky contraptions in Sanbox, play an intense game of Trouble in Terrorist Town, roleplay in... well... RolePlay. The gamemodes vary from being chased by slender in a fast, epic search to find the eight pages all the way to relaxing with your freinds and watching YouTube videos in the Gmod Cinema. Like I said, the game description is a lie, theres so much more to do than just Sandbox, it just takes some getting used to. It really is one of the most addictive games out there! It's such a shame that it was dragged down when little kids started to play. If your'e a child playing this game, for the love of all that is sane in the world,  off and go back to call of duty where you belong.
[23]ThEpAcKsWaG;-;When I first started playing this game i didn't know what to do.Then i started joining servers, and then asking poeple what to do then, I realized how to play it.Then i keep getting better and, better and, better.But i still haven't got to know what to do on some of the servers.
DeLiGiT;-;Very good. no flaws. Everyone nice yes. No bad manners.
S;-;One of the best games Ive ever played. One of my all time favorites :yay:
Danny_playz;-;the creativity is real i have played the first half life teamfortress 2 and minecraft. its all those combined with easy to get maps and addons getting in servers arent realy a problem but its not like they're all empty. i rate this 35678554u4984638956894 out of 10. yes i know i put a "u" in there.

Good job Garry Newman. Well Played.

Vaskez;-;Despite its release date, this is still one of the best games out there, where only your imagination is the limit to what you can do. The base game is sandbox with Half-Life 2 weapons and it supports models from most Source engine games such as Counterstrike Source, Team Fortress 2 and Left for Dead 2. New features aswell as modifying exisiting ones can be done through modding, and the language used in the mods is lua, which is very easy to pick up on and learn.
Test;-;This game has provided me with hours upon hours of enjoyment. Highly recommend this game.
Sif;-;2 Gb installation folder is a lie.
Lora is a Lora;-;Nice game.
Jol;-;UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY!!! I've had way too much fun with this game. Theres always new content since the Workshop and it has great multiplayer with many options. This game is a STEAM ESSENTIAL
Jumpppy.;-;I only played around 1 hour and a half and I must say that I never had so much fun in a game in such a little game time like on GMod. I'm LOVING this game, I'm just... LOVING IT! I had so much fun playing Murderer.. you can't even imagine! Awesome game, very cool, funny & entertaining, and if you play it with friends it'll be even cooler! Awesome game, for real. It's cheap, it's fun and it is cool. I'd rather buy this game then DayZ (look at my analisys of it). Gotta rate this game 10/10! It's just... superb, I'm speechless with this game.

RYNO MAN;-;"What is it?" is probably the most frequently asked question about G-Mod. This ever changing game has left many with that question unanswered. Today we seek to have that question answered. Today we will leave that question unanswered. Welcome to Garry's Mod. I suppose I should start with the gameplay. That is just the unique thing about G-Mod though. It has no one set gamemode. The whole point of G-Mod is to test, create, and try out the many different gamemodes you can download from the Steam Workshop. They are fun and there is a great variety to chose from. The game also comes with two preloaded gamemodes. Trouble in Terrorist Town and Sandbox. Sandbox is basic build/do whatever you want gamemode, while Trouble in Terrorist town is a murderer/detective style gamemode. Both are fun and intuitive. The sandbox gamemode gives you more freedom, but has a bit of a larger learning curve. The Trouble in Terrorist Town gamemode is a bit more for those who are accustomed to games like Unreal Tournament or Counter-Strike. I personally prefer playing on the Sandbox gamemode as it allows you to build anything you want via the tools provided within the Source Engine. You might still be wondering: "What exactly do you do in Garry's Mod?" Well to answer your question, just about anything you want! That is what makes Garry's Mod so amazing...the freedom limited by unlimited boundaries. Now as for the graphics. They are good. The Source Engine does an excellent job of creating a beautiful, fluid, and realistic world. For being an engine almost 10 years old it still does not falter in it's quality. The sound is anything but a disappointment. It is loud, powerful and moving. Because this is primarily a Sandbox game it gives the user freedom to add on their own sounds or sound effects from the workshop. I cannot tell you how many times I have been playing on some kind of a Horror Map and the key element was the loud and pulsing sound. A screech coming from behind, sounds like a real screech from behind. Ok, now for Lasting Appeal. Ummmm...hmmmm. About as unlimited and ongoing as you want it to be. Simple as that. All in all, this is a great game for Minecraft lovers (14 and up :) and Source Engine developers alike. Why? Well...cause it's G-Mod of course! And what is that exactly? Well, let's not go down that road... Overall Rating: 8/10 Presentation: 9/10 Multiplayer: 6/10 Gameplay: 7.5/10 Graphics: 7/10 Sound: 8/10 Lasting Appeal: 10/10 Overall Rating: 8/10
Mr_PunchBang;-;Best Physics game where you can build your own things,stuff and more....
Highly Educated Pot o' Noodels;-;Slapped a guy with a fish on DarkRP got banned for RDM 10/10 would slap again

Captain Ginger;-;heres why you should buy this game. cause you should. that is all. ok fine i'll tell you...jackass...anyways, buy this game because 1.you meet...interesting people...like the doctor...yeah... 2. murder...not the game mode, just murdering poeple in game 3. ing with mother nature. it is beautifull 4.why are you still reading this list? it is a good game, now go buy it!
PAUL SHART THE MEMER;-;if you like to screw around in game's. here you go. and have stupid mod's you can download. and play with your friend's and mess around and just do what ever you want, here's the game. garry's mod.
RedstoneManiacHD;-;Garry's mod. It is a realy good game if you injoy a first person shooter, a roleplay or just an ordenary sandbox game. Also the workshop makes this game much better with over 1,000,000 Mods, maps, playermodles, and much more. It is based on half life 2 and has the gravity gun and all the wepons from it. I strongly recomend you to get this game. I give it a 9 1/2 out of 10
GLOBALPREDATORx;-;Every steam user should be Obligated to have this game in their library
The Achievement Hunter;-;I like this game because it gives you the spare time to have fun with your friends play and meet new people on steam and it also is game to basically roleplay or do anything really
Chap Chappington;-;Meh its decent, personally i only play it for the fun gamemodes but no one makes any good ones anymore, the only ones that are good are Dark RP (for trolling), zombie survival (gets old fast) and a couple other ones. People just play gmod for TTT and roleplay but none of those get updated anymore and since the developers are making Rust then gmod is just forgotten now which makes me sad as this has so much potential! Good news is most of the 10 year old s of the gmod community are now gone! Thanks to rust :D. Also the developers are greedy s.
SoggySocks;-;A good indie game for all who is creative. includes tens of selections of "minigames" for Garry's mod, for example; RolePlay, Jailbreak, PropHunt, Stop it slender and obviously alot more. In my own opinion this game is great for artistic/creative types of people over the age of 13. most people on Garry's mod seem to be 'Squeekers' as Elder's seem to say. This game is very educational, you can learn basic science and alot of techniqual difficulties able to easily solve. The main feature of Garry's Mod is SandBox. The 'GameMode' where you can do anything! You can also create a server to allow your friends to play with. If you're going to buy this game i seriously suggest buying counter strike source too. (and halflife) Take my advice on this game. like seriously... I downloaded this game in 2008 and have been playing it every day since. It NEVER gets boring. There is allways someone or something to keep you occupied. You can take my advice because ive been playing this game for years. you can easily tell. Look at my game time. Over 2,300 Hours! Thats a long time. I hope this helped.

Iplaygames54 (realy sticky);-;this game it the best friend me i all ways accept.
Fluff-Kevlar;-;I can't -not- recommend Garry's Mod as it's whatever you make it. Make things yourself in sandbox modes, or join one of hundreds of custom game types, some of which are incredibly well done and truly don't even make you realize you're playing Garry's Mod. Like mini-golf, kart racing, hide and seek, prop hunt, slender, obstacle courses list goes on. It's always cheap and has tons of possible games for you to try out for free once you get it.
{GoDs};-;10/10 "I'd tap that." (   )
RocksAndMan;-;If you like melons and flying chairs this is the game for you.
Senior Spicy Wewe;-;Become a terrorist, blew up friends with jihad bomb. 10/10
coolsuper333;-;This Game Is A Great Sandbox It Has Realistic Gravity And Its Fun To Just... Mess Around With. Of Course There Is Mutiplayer And Lots Of Gamemodes Even Lots Of Addons I Recommend The Realistic Damage And SCars But You Can Choose What To Get I Have Over 300 Addons That I Found Very Intresting. If You Love To Build You Can Make Your Own Addons And Maps. You Can Even Play The WHOLE Story Of Half Life 2 In Gmod And Use Whatever Weapons You Like! You Can Also Play TF2 Maps And Maps From A Few Other Games. If You Think Gmod Sounds Like Your Type Of Game You Can Go On Youtube To See More Or You Could Buy The Game! I Would Rate It 9/10 Not 10/10 Because Of Errors, Lag, Well Thanks For Reading!
Ass Mushroom King;-;Best game on PC
[SLO]Hana3502;-;Great game for fun! Really fun,this game has many gamemodes like murder,sandbox,... THE THINGS I DON'T LIKE: -Maps take so much to load -Textures sometime wont load -On some textures it says: ERROR -Laggs -The game should be like 5(its overpriced) I rate this game 6/10.

Long, addicting, fun, and silly gameplay guarenteed, with lots of fun mods, maps, modes, etc. for ONLY $10!!!!!

Unicorn Balls;-;You can always play this lovely game called Garry's Mod! :-)
Enjgine;-;I haven't played much, but from what I've heard on my mums pregnancy chat rooms' "Kids Zone" IRC, this game is amazing. Comments such as: "I built a house", "What does 'q' do" and "Stretching often enhances birthing speed" are just some of the literally seven comments I've heard of it. As an experiment, I put my three year old brother on the game and within 12 seconds he was in control of the entire mafia and running an illegal drug operation out of a shabby 4-walls-and-a-fading-wall house but then the admin came on and said he can't shoot people walking past for being 'over 15'. None-the-less the superadmin came on and banned that admin, before celebrating his 13th birthday with his mum. If I had to say one thing about the game, it would be something really good but I'm not sure what because my 16th birthday is tomorrow and I'm not really thinking. Edit: This game is so  now that I'm 16, I play CSGO I have 23 Knives you can't get knives in Gmod this game is  and gay and you can't shoot everyone Edit: I play this game with my friends sometimes, but I usually just lobby with them for a CSGO match. I don't have much time anymore because I work after leaving school, but this game is okay if you didn't have to put up with the 12 year olds.
Doge;-;maybe this is one of the greatest game in the world ?

Mmarz11;-;A fun game to play with a lot of various gamemodes for one to choose from. I primarily play the Trouble in Terrorist Town gamemode which is loads of fun especially when you have a lot of people on who know what they are doing. You really need to be sneaky and skilled in such a situation. Will push you to do your best.
TheDragonFruite;-;A very intresting and fun game to play. Or not just one game but many games. Its one game with tonns of different game modes to play. Everything from jail brak to deathrun and darkRP. If you love to have fun and meet other people who like to have fun in a game this is a game for you. And you can build youre own gamemodes and maps in this if you want. Its a sandbox game called Garry's Mod

Rictalspace;-;A great game with tons of available modifications that will keep you playing for literally months on end.
Yayo;-;the community makes this game if it wasnt for the community it would be a poorly coded piece of  uninspired mod made by a guy who doesnt want to hire people to help him and wants it to remain his singular masterpiece of a creation which he breaks every update wait its that too okay yeah i sort of hate this game but i have 1600+ hours in it and that is only due to the community the community made ttt, dark(no)rp, and all the other gamemodes that make gmod stick out garry didn't garry doesn't do  garry breaks  every update that ends up killing off good gamemodes i dont like garry okay
VAC;-;great game :D
MrBuzzKill;-;This is one of those games that gives you hundreds of hours of entertainment for a low price... It has something for everyone theres hundreds of different modes in the game itself. TTT,Murder,Deathrun,DarkRP,horror maps those are just some of the few. This game really is a great buy specially when it goes for 1 on sales (   )

Toasty;-;one Awesome Game / Mod
B4;-;Awesome game. Had to fix it to get it to work on Linux properly though.
Corndog;-;One of my favourite games on Steam. It's only 5.99, and with literally hundreds of thousands of add-ons and custom gamemodes, it's definitely worth the price for the amount of fun you can have on it. You may want to get a group of friends together to play it at first as some of the tools can be hard to use, but after an hour or two, you can make anything you want, with a few Youtube guides maybe.
Jejetsky;-;Trouble in terrorist town, i walk into a room, pull out a Jihad Bomb, kill 9 people and win. 10/10 would play again.

Derplord560;-;Fun game to mess around with freinds and you can do anything.
Comet;-;Garry's Mod. Well, there's a lot I can say about this 'game'. It started as a simple modification, and it's now one of the most popular games on Steam. How, you ask? Because it's Open Source. [en.wikipedia.org] Sure, the game has its cons, like times where framerate gets bad, but there's a lot of fun to be had, like constructing things with friends, or roleplaying on DarkRP. -MY Pros- >Expansive list of Gamemodes. >Completely user-populated. >Never the same experience. >Co-op playability. >Overall, a fun experience. -MY Cons- >Large amount of griefers. >Underage mic spam. >Immaturity. >Framerate loss (at times). >At least 1 source game required (TF2 counts, but I strongly suggest CS:S). >Crashes relating to addons. Despite the cons, this game is worth checking out. I hope you enjoy playing this, and have fun! (Source: 1,693.4 hours.)
NewBlu <leekspin.com>;-;Became a big flying fat chicken and smacked a cop with popcorn. 420/10
Kraven;-;This game is... many games in one, any person will find something to enjoy here!
Spooky;-;Yet another Briliant game from VALVE, if you are thinking about getting this game GET IT it is the most addictive game in the history of games TO BE WARNED: #1 As i am in Australia i can not connect to well to american servers, But there are still 100's of communitys out there who play the most common gamemodes. #2 Do not judge the game via the single player, Multiplayer is the way to go with 100's of game modes and 10's of thousands of players every second All the popular gamemodes (as of 31/01/14) Gamemode number #1 Ttt (also know as trouble in terrorist town) is a game were you can be picked to play as 1 of 3 "classes" if you will, they are: Innocent: Were you are to kill all the traitors before they kill you (note do not kill anyone for looking sus) Tratior: You are there to kill anyone with any means possible But do not get caught doing so this will result in people killing you Detective: You are basicly an innocent but with a twist. if you find a dead body you can id it finding the dna of a tratior, You are a huge influance on the game therfore you are a target to the tratiors Trying staying in a large group. (my fav)Gamemode number #2 Darkrp, darkrp is a game all about roleplaying you can become anything from a cop to a hardcore murderer, do make sure you read the rules on this gamemode as there are a lot of way to be banned or kicked on this gamemode Gamemode number #3 Prop Hunt, Prop hunt is a game were there are two teams these teams are: The prop: you can turn into anything you can see, Make sure you blend into the enviroment or you will be found and killed by the Hunters: This class is the class that goes around looking for the props by searching the enviroment for "differences" and then if they feel the need that can shot it, but if they get it wrong depending on how many props they hit they loss 5- 95 health so be warned. So this is garrys mod, i would recomend this to anyone even my grammar! i give it a 10/10. And i see my self playing this sucker for a long time to come :). (sorry for grammar and spelling mistakes i wrote this up in 2 minutes)
Garrus;-;I was abused by a chair that was being controlled by a npc. I also made a cake
Terry Crews;-;The only game I know were you can start to build a fort then give up and make it look like Katy Perry is swimming in a pool of babys made out of stop signs.
Quinton, Gaurdian of Fine Salts;-;You see how I put a positive review? This is the thing, Its a 50/50 negative/positive, you see, the game itself is fun because you can do what you want, however, too many minecraft 6 year olds came on and ed the game up with $500,000,000,000 donates just to be able to spawn something. So theres my review, I say buy the game, but prepare yourself for some  people. (DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON DARKRP THESE DAYS.)

Fernando the ManWhore;-;Amazing. Get the anal lube!
THE DOCTOR;-;JUST LOOK OUT FOR HACKERS
[SM2] KairaWolf;-;A real bunch of laughs for everyone who plays it, Garry's Mod is a true piece of art. Whether you are new to this genre or a seasoned professional, I reccomend this game to everyone. You can create wonderful contraptions, glorious views or, if this does not appeal to you, just plain and simple beating the crap out of random objects and NPCs. There are thousands of modifications to the vanilla game, like extra maps, vehicles and weapons. So many weapons. So, in conclusion, wonderful game. The only real downside is that it tends to crash a lot if you have a lot of addons. Despite the downsides, I rate this game an 8.5/10.
Karl;-;Nice game takes a lot of time to create good stuff but i supose it is agood game at a nice price especially as i got this game for free
Anders;-;So entertaining and fun, defo a game spending some time on :)

Ariana Grande's Papa;-;This is by far the best multi gamemode game I have ever played. This game lets you defy the laws of physics, Play about 500 different gamemodes, such as sandbox, Prop hunt, and Trouble in terrorist town. Sand box lets you do almost anything by placing itens in the air, welding two items together with the tool gun, or making a car out of a mattress and wheels. by far the best multi gamemode game out there
Wekk;-;Hey have you wanted to do almost everything int Half-life 2? This is for you then this like the creative mode for HL2. I highly recomend it to everyone. it gets 10/10 for me!
JewShoe;-;I love this game! You can make whatever you want in it! You download addons which let you have almost anything you can imagine! And if you have other source games, you can have all the maps and materials. The multiplayer is great with so many gamemodes! I highly reccommend this game!

Bestimmt nicht Jger;-;Kind of ruined my life 10/10 would play
Ryan Draconis;-;verry nice game and you can play around and spawn random stuff alo you can create alot of fun stuff the minigames are also verry fun
Opiziite;-;Garry's mod is a great game for both casual and hard-core gamers, with plenty of game modes and its well-known 'sandbox' feature it is pretty hard to become 'fed up' of this stupendous game. Although this game is currently priced at a very respectable 5.99 it is much more expensive overall, for instance "missing textures" is a big f****** nuisance in this game (pardon my French), to make things easy this game requires you to have certain games installed in order to not see 'bright purple' and black' checkered squares everywhere or the well know "Error" instead of your desired 'object' in game. So to overcome this you may need to buy some of, if not all of Valve's games. Yes from CSS to HL2, as the game does indeed run on the 'Source engine'. Negatives aside this game is extremely fun, especially with friends. Inviting a group of friends and then just spawn killing them with 'duplicated dynamite' or crushing them with the random prop is freaking hilarious and oddly amusing. And of course the odd immature player that spawns in Barney and the Metrocops in, the relentless anal sex posturing with Alyx Vance. Aside from that, Gmod consists of 8 game modes and dozens of others that are made by the almost infinite online community, 'Trouble in Terrorist Town' (TTT) and CityRP being my favourites of most of the game modes. Building may look pretty 'daunting' at times and trust me it is, but with practice it becomes a subconscious feat. But not to worry making a pretty basic and cool looking 'build' that can easily impress or annoy your many friends can only take a few hover balls with the stay 'upright' feature on and a 'muscle' rope that can move in all directions, and "Shabam" you got a pretty easy build right in front of your eyes. And for all the lazy buggers out there Garry kindly added the 'Dupes' button which allows you to spawn and use other people amazing "creations" that can kill and impress the people around you. Overall this game is a must buy and I recommend it highly to anyone who just wants to have a good time with friends or the vast community... Opiziite - 9.7
TheRustySandwich;-;you make ragdolls do stuff. 10/10

Nice Rexi;-;"Oh. Okay. G-Garrys mod. Alright, lets do this. ...I don't know. it's a game that isn't always the same game. that's good..i suppose." That was what i said about this game a year ago. Lots have changed. So, I don't enjoy this game anymore. It's just getting to the point where it's painful to play, due to simple boredom. If you haven't played something like it before, great. Go get it. But, i can't play it anymore. 1247 hours, man. Anyway, Recommended it. But, it gets INCREDIBLY boring after some time. Go team.
noth1ng;-;Perfect sandbox with great community, but sometimes (always) Garry breaks things with new update.
SaGeD ActiOn;-;amazing game. With millions of maps
Xoct;-;Game is fun when you play with friend , amazing community and of course lots of minigames and mods and mods in garrys mod are very easy to install with workshop!       ,      !

_53732_;-;The variety of games, plugins, addons and mods this game has is what makes it stand out. The Simple sandbox singleplayer, and the limitless games of multiplayer adds countless entertainment value, for 10 bucks you will be playing, hour, after hour, after hour. Whether being paranoid in Trouble in Terrorist Town, or playing Cops and Robbers, this game is the best mod of the Source Engine to date.
Miss Shitsherself;-;You need to buy this game if you don't already own it
x227man;-;Amazing game. If you know Lua there is a whole other side to GMod because you can make mods and  around with code.

Rasputin;-;Thare are no words to describe this game. It's that good. If you do not have this, stop reading this right now and get it. The game can be almost anything you want it to be. Want a FPS, sure! Want a Zombie Survival, Sure! Want to blow up Chuck Noris at the White House as a My Little Pony with a Neuclear Rocket Launcher? Yes, you can do that to. Any thing you can thinck of can become real in Gary's Mod, makeing the game a different Expirence every time I launch it. And with the active community, thare are constant mods and creations coming out. Just get this game. Best $10 I've ever spent, and make it yours too.
[RS] Snow;-;A largely grown game with a great community, Garry's Mod Has to be the most fun experience anyone will have whether that be playing sandbox,DarkRP,TTT,Murder or any other gamemode you find enjoyable. Its a fun experience for everyone. 9/10 Worth Buying

Mod the game with 100s of mods in the Steam workshop that range from weapons to maps to playermodels (your character) and much more! Play to you heart's desire in this crazy game!

Vhilltex[DKA];-;Garry's Mod is a great example of what more sandbox multiplayer also games should be doing! This product is a extremely fun sandbox, that is entertaining. It doesn't compare though to its open community! Garry's Mod's community is great! Because of that it is still rapidly coming out with gamemodes the community is making tons of gamemodes, items, props, etc. From Trouble in Terrorist Town (personal favorite), and extremely recommend to Prop Hunt (another personal favorite)! it has tons of options to do with friends and more. ( Each divided into categories of 5/5 ) +: EPIC Gamemodes 5/5 +: Cheap Price of $10 +: EXTREMELY fun 4.5/5 - : Needs multiple games to work properly TOTAL SCORE: 9.5

{Cas} [MCSN] CasualGaming;-;Alot of fun. This is a game I rush to to play. It is just a sandbox game where you have control of everything. But when you are in a server and you are not the admin. But It is just something that you could enjoy. you can make mods, artwork, c creations, anything you can think of. But there is one thing I'm a puzzled on. Is it like a cartoon or like a real life thing.
Super Splash bro;-;Tottally worth the $9.99, there is so much to do with all the gamemodes and add ons
Dade;-;Tried playing on a server. Got kicked for having an "Uncooperative name" Joined back 5 times until I was banned for life. 01/01 I give it my Nickelodeon's Kids Choice award

dead;-;This Game.... This ING Game...is the best Thing that ever happend to Me.
Prototype VA;-;This game is great for builders
Archie;-;This game wasn't the best before the update, but thanks a lot garry, you ed over garry's mod and all your former fans. Propkilling is filled with gays, autistic kids, and general bonehead shitcunts. Builders are filled with 8-12 year olds, DarkRP is just ing stupid, and you invited wannabe gamer ing s like pewdiepie into the game, and they act as if they've known gmod and played it since the beginning. Overall, before update, 8/10, after update, 1/50. I hate to say I hate the new gmod and everyone in it. All the gmod Veterans are gone, and all that's left are autistic wannabe  trolls, and  like mikethanh (AKA Kelvin Evan). The game actually just infuriates me when I play it, I've never seen such a paradise be destroyed except during the great hurricane of chile, and the islands around it. You ruined the game garry, you ing ruined it. The community is ruined too, nobody with an IQ over 10 plays the ing game anymore! It's an autistic child's paradise, and it ing pisses me off, I officially quit playing codependently with anybody on this ing  game.
THAT NIGGA BAD;-;Not having an Objective has never been that entertaining!
BlueGoat12;-;One of the best games i have ever played!
UBER THE VODKA;-;I spent 30 minutes of this game throwing Heavy around cp_egypt. Most fun 30 mins of my life.
Travingel;-;i dont know how to explain it, but i recommend it
[IMI] Dr Moose;-;simply, quite the ticket
NoxiousDakota *CNC*;-;Garry's Mod is the best Sandbox game in my opinion, NPCs, Props to build, mechanics, and even mods created by other people!
Ol'nessy;-;I've played this game so much that I actually feel sorry for it when I don't play.
Bovril Freeman;-;10/10 would bang

[TGC] Jannik;-;Garrysmod is a sandbox game, but have become so much more. I would even dare to say that its on of the most well designed games for a very long time! - I recommend this game for players who like to play first person shooter games.
Manstercote;-;This game just can't be reviewed... IT'S TOO AWESOME TO BE REVIEWED!
dominator7713/TradingKnife;-;best game ever games inside of a game !!!
Joel V12;-;Now garrys mod really gets me questioning my sexualality. I always thought I was a hetro sexual type of transvestite (even though I always had a crush on Edward Cullen... but who doesn't?) But when I first spawned G-man and Gordan Freeman together, it made be so aroused that I started to make a famous series of gay porn called 'G-man's G-Spot' which can be found on {LINK REMOVED} bestgore.com. This really has ruined all my relationships in my life which is why I have to give this game a 0.5 out of 10.
james;-;I found Garry's Mod from Seananners when he played TTT. After playing the game myself, I soon fell in LOVE with it. I currently have 1000+ hours, and I have met about all my friends on this game, as so as other amazing people. This game has amazing gamemodes like TTT, Deathrun, Jailbreak, GMTower, Minigames, and so much more. This game gives a unique experience you will ever have. It is not like Minecraft or any regular FPS shooter, but it mixes just about everything you will ever play in this. I recommend this game a lot, and you will not regret spending under $15 dollars for this game.
Think1n;-;Short Version - Fun and great to play with friends
Valiton;-;Garry's Mod gives you a ridiculous amount of freedom with tons of ridiculous tools which translates into a lot of ridiculous fun. The huge amount of Workshop content and the ability to do just about whatever you want with it gives this game truly endless potential and diversity. At its core it's a sandbox but if you're the type that needs an objective to have a good time there are plenty of gamemodes that can completely change the way you play. For $10 or the price of one of the packages that includes it, Garry's Mod really is a must-have for anyone that enjoys stupid fun from time to time.
[Brigada]_Fedor;-;Realy nice game (  )
Maverick;-;Great game with alot of gamemodes for alot of playtime. Huge community =D
Astrah |ZSU|;-;one of the funniest games ever and possibly one of the best games ever playing sandbox with addons with friends is very fun
Ken Shy;-;Garry's Mod is a sandbox game. You have a wide variety of props from various Source games (depending on which you own), and multiple tools at your disposal. With these, you can build different contraptions, make vehicles, construct buildings, etc. As well as all the content included in the game, you can find a ton of mods online via the game's website or Steam Workshop. You can also make/script your own. But the fun doesn't stop there. Multiplayer is a totally different thing entirely. You can find sandbox servers and build with up to hundreds of other players, or you could dive into one of the many user created game modes. From Hide and Seek to Role Playing, there is a huge variety of unique modes to play. A few I would recommend are: Trouble in Terrorist Town. A group of 'innocent' terrorists must work with the detective(s) to discover who the traitors are and kill them. The traitors must take out the innocents, preferably without alerting anyone else. No one knows who is innocent and who is not, making for a sometimes tense experience. Morbus. A group of humans must hold out for a certain amount of time against aliens, or kill them all. There are two types of aliens: Brood aliens, and Swarm aliens. The Brood aliens get upgrades, and can transform into humans. Allowing them to get into groups and pick off people one by one. The Swarm aliens are what players spawn as when they die (assuming they were killed by another Swarm alien, or human). These have a melee and ranged attack, but no upgrades. Their role is to weaken the humans, and try to kill them. The humans have needs. Every now and then you will have to either sleep, eat, shower, or pee. You cannot move during this time, so must be wary of those around you, in case they are brood aliens. Overall one of the best game modes. A ton of fun, especially with friends. DarkRP. DarkRP is one of the more casual RP modes in Gmod. You spawn into the map as a citizen, and can choose a job to play as. From drug dealers to civil protection, there is a wide variety of roles to pick. You can go around earning money, commit crimes, buy and furnish your own house, etc. Great if you find the more serious RP servers to be boring. If you plan to buy the game, be sure you own Counter-Strike: Source too. A lot of maps use textures from CS:S, and if you do not own it you will see purple and black squares everywhere. Overall the game is absolutely brilliant. One of the very few that I can keep going back to and not get bored. One of the best purchases I have ever made.
zigi|Sergei;-;this game is filled with opetuneties and you will liturely never get bored of playing buy this game
S3pirion (gone till the 20th);-;Dont even take time to look at the reviews, they will all say the same thing. GET THIS GAME. If your still doubting me, and want to read the reviews, fine by me, but youll just be wasting your time. GET THIS ING GAME. DO IT. THINK ABOUT DOING IT. IF YOU GET IT ON SALE ITS EVEN BETTER BECAUSE THE GREATEST, WACKIEST, BEST PHYSICS/SANDBOX/CRAZYIMULATOR2014 IS CHEAPER. Get this game. In all seriousness, please get this game. youll be glad you did.

DolphinPOW;-;Money well spent...One of the best games i have ever played
FaGGamer;-;pretty fun to play with mates
NinjaZ.in.PyjamaZ;-;Possibly the greatest sandbox mod to ever exist. Combining Source games with this mod is revolutionary! No mod has ever been this creative. If this game didn't have the Steam Workshop then this game would never be as good as it is now. And the fact that they made this back in 2006 is incredible! If any other company tried to make a replica of Garry's Mod in 2014 I reckon It would be awful. 10/10
MoonMan;-;Great Game! 10/10
Saint Aaron;-;A game where you can make goofy movies or just make amazing things!!
Njlamp;-;My favorite game, it just has infinite content, does not require much to run, its a truely addictive sandbox.

Dramawind;-;Nuclear watermelons, Kleiner fireworks and rae guns.
Arnaldo Beowulf;-;Funny and weird, you're gonna laugh in the dumbest times, perfect for playing with your friends or for meeting people on other servers. I totally reccomend it.
xXxHoboGodxXx420D0ngsqu4d;-;I dont know how to write a review. I DO know how to tell you if something is good. This is good. Also, heres a recipe for pancakes (4 servings): First, heres what youll need: 1 cup of flower. 1 tablespoon of baking powder. 1 tablespoon of sugar. 1/2 teaspoon of salt. 1 egg, beaten. 1 cup of milk. 2 tablespoons of vegtable oil A Frying pan/Griddle/Skillet (not skrillex) A source of heat. *now your ready to get baking... or is it cooking? idk* Mix together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Combine eggs, milk, and oil. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients, stirring until just moist. Let mixture rest 30 seconds. Spoon or pour onto greased, hot griddle or nonstick skillet. Cook pancakes on the first side until bubbles appear on the upper surface. Turn over and cook until the bottom is golden. You can make a nice variation on these by adding a mashed black banana and 1/2 teaspoon of cinammon to the batter. Yum? 11/10 would burn pancakes again.
Cynical Chorros;-;wow such fun.
Radek;-;I don't even know what to say about its awesomeness.
Reed;-;Join a French server of DarkRP. Become a medic because there was no medic on the server. Players/cops asks to get healed. Some RDA'er (random arrest) arrested me for no reason. Got released from jail Went back to the PD in order to say what a  this RDA'er is (in English). He responded in the chat with 'English guy on the server' in French i believe. Asked help from an admin. Admin speaks no English. Get kicked. Rejoin Ask for help of what just happend 3 mins ago. Get banned 10/10 would complain again 11/10 would ask from French admin's help 'Do you recommend this game?' Answer: Hell yeah! Once you buy this game, there is no going back by then.
CEAON;-;Garry's mod is basically the everything game. 10/10
TTM~Ferrerman1;-;Wanna know how good of a game it is? Just check my hours on here.... + Achievements
Clucker2808;-;One of my favorite games of all time. Mainly because it isnt just one game, as there are many mods that turn it into other games. It could be a fun RP game, or a Sled building racer, or a Prop Hunt game. I also love all the fun maps that the communtiy makes, its fun to run around a Horror map with a friends, or have a nuclear war in a large desert with lots of secret areas.
Wislyd;-;One of the best sandbox games I have ever played. The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing, and it's just a lot of fun to play. Highly recommended.
FlashNightburst;-;Great game.
Metal Dragon;-;Just Shut up and Buy it.
Foxy the Physco Fox;-;awsome game!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Qahriil;-;A long time ago, on my first day, I was massacred by man-made drivable bathtub tanks. I give 10/10
Robin;-;Should you buy gmod? Well I will tell you how I became Robin to give you a rough idea of what gmod is like. I hadn't been on garrys mod in a while and needed to uninstall some games so I tried it out. I instantly went online and looked for a new server to join and came across a server known as DerpRP under the DarkRP section of multiplayer. As soon as I got onto the server I was confronted by a rocket launcher wielding Hitler and Batman. I attemtped to pee on Hitler and he responded by pulling a shotgun and demanding I get in his sex dungeon. They locked me in the room for 10 minutes and give me a baby doll covered in blood to play with before executing me. When I respawned I came out into the street to see a large group of people get blown up by Batman and my goal became clear to me. I must... Team up with them and build a bank where we steal peoples printers. Unfortunatly by the time we had finished the bank I had to go so they requested that I left gmod running. When I arrived home I found that Batman and Hitler and stolen all my printers destroyed my base and murdered me before leaving the bank alarm on for all my neighbours to hear coming out of my full volume speakers. Seconds after I respawned I was then mugged by an angry group of hobos who eventually pushed me infront of a train but when it looked like I was going to die again Hitler and Batman showed up wielding swords. The hobos scattered and made dolphin noises as they ran away getting chased by a  off Hitler. Batman placed a couch that he had in his pocket on the track and escaped with only a split second to spare. As me and Batman emerged from the underground train station I looked up into the sky and thought to myself damn this is bad  before Hitler reappeared and blew us both up. Garrys mod isnt only a great game its a great game to make friends. To this date me and Hitler and Batman still go round invading french servers which dont have any admins and murdering innocent civilains. But thats what makes gmod so fun. You can do litterlay anything. I would reccomend Garrys Mod to everyone that has a sense of humour and/or a soul. Gmod is love. Gmod if life
TypicalRookie;-;Garry's Mod is with out a doubt the best game on Steam I own. You can spend countless hours playing and still find new and intersting things to do. Almost anything can be created wether you build it in Sandbox, or develope it in LUA, the possibilites are endless. Garry's Mod ships with two default gamemodes, Sandbox and Trouble in Terrorist town. Sandbox is simply what you make of it. The main point to sandbox is to create new contraptions, and play around with them. Sandbox has no real goal to it unless you make one yourself. And the other gamemode, Trouble in Terrorist Town, actually has a point to it. In Touble in Terrorist Town you spawn [randomly] as a Traitor, Innocent, or Detective. The Traitors goal is to try and eliminate the Innocent and Detectives, while the Innocent and Detectives goal is to find out who the Traitor(s) are, and try to eliminate them instead! Garry's Mod also supports customgamemodes. Every other gamemode, besides Sandbox and Trouble in Terrorist town have been made by the community. Gamemode creation takes time, patience and knowledge. There are many different gamemodes that have been created, ranging from Sandbox and Trouble in Terrorist town spin-offs, to roleplay, deathmatch, survival, and more! Finding a new gamemode to play is as easy as opening the in-game server browser and joining a server. Every server in Garry's Mod is run by the community, there are no server's hosted by the games creators. Server's run any gamemode they choose, and how the choose. Server's are able to add addons, created by the community, to make the experience more enjoyable for everyone. Addons are another thing that Garry's Mod shines at. Addons are made by the community, like most everything, and usually help to heighten your overall fun while playing. Thousands and thousands of addons of every sort have been made through Garry's Mods existence. There are addons ranging from roller coaster creators, new and different weapons and tools, new maps, and almost anything you can think of! Overall, I belive that Garry's Mod can be an enjoyable game for anyone. What you get out of playing Garry's Mod is what you make it. Since Garry's Mod has no pre-define goals, you can really do just about anything, and then some. Garry's Mod is worth the amazingly cheap price tag.
Sabdab;-;Not only does this game host a sandbox for tons of possibilities, it holds player-made gamemodes to play for thousands of hours (as you can see by my number of hours played). Once I heard of Garry's Mod, I got it for TTT, but then I found other gamemodes like DarkRP, Spacebuild 3, Pirate Ship Wars, and Sledbuild. These things made me a busy man for a very long time, and that time is still going on right now!
Moo Goes Cow;-;Got the game, played with friends, and an hour later, We created a bathtub propelled by 27 thrusters attached to the back and 4 usable chairs inside. And the day after, I joined the same server my friends where on, and I got hit by another flying bathtub, followed by a giant snack machine with an explosive barrel welded onto it. Ten out of 10.
Agenticy07;-;You can throw bathtubs at people. 10/10
Jack| TotalRevolutionGaming.com;-;An amazing and creative game, I would definitely recommend this game!
aeroleet=aeroleet=aeroleet=ALG;-;This game is way too addicting, don't play this if you have a job or if you are doing exams, seriously. TIME FOR WIKI SPAM: Garry's Mod (often abbreviated as GMOD) is a sandbox physics game using a modified Source engine, created by Garry Newman. Garry's Mod has been available on Valve's content delivery service Steam since November 29, 2006.[1] In the past purchase of Garry's Mod required the user to own at least one game on Steam based on the Source engine, such as Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Portal, or Team Fortress 2,[1] however as of May 2014 the game can be purchased by itself on Steam. It is also commonly used for the creation and publishing of videos[3][4] on YouTube, mainly from Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2, Portal, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. Garry's Mod was originally a modification for Valve's Half-Life 2, but was later made into a standalone Steam game that was officially released on November 29, 2006 dubbed Garry's Mod 10. The current version, Garry's Mod 14.04.04, was released on April 4, 2014. In February 2014 it was revealed on Twitter by Newman that the game had "just broke" US$ 30 million.[5] As of November 2013 the game has sold 3.5 million copies. Although Garry's Mod is usually considered to be a full game, it has no game objective and players can use the game's set of tools for any purpose whatsoever, although sometimes when playing on a multiplayer server it may have role-play or other types of game modes. Garry's Mod allows players to manipulate items, furniture and "props"  various objects that players can place in-game. Props can be selected from any installed Source engine game or from a community created collection. The game features two "guns"  Physics Gun and Tool Gun for manipulating objects. The Physics Gun allows objects to be picked up, adjusted, and frozen in place. The Tool Gun is a multi-purpose tool for performing various tasks, such as combining props, attaching them via ropes, and creating controllable winches and wheels. The Tool Gun is also used to control add-ons created by the community. Another popular Garry's Mod concept is ragdoll posing. The player can instantiate a ragdoll model from a Source game and pose it using a variety of tools.[7] This is a popular tool for making fan-made videos and machinimas. Garry's Mod takes advantage of the Source engine's modified version of the Havok Physics Engine,[8] which allows players to build contraptions that follow the laws of physics. In winter 2009/2010, a contest was held for Garry's Mod by the game's developers to create the best new game mode using a programming framework called "Fretta".[10] Fretta, Italian for "hurry", allows developers to quickly and easily create new game modes for Garry's Mod with commonly required functionality already implemented so the developers can focus on unique aspects of their game modes. Fretta was inspired by a similar fan created framework "Rambo_6's Simple Gamemode Base". However, for inclusion in Garry's Mod, Newman decided to rewrite it with input and contributions from the original author and other developers.[11] The winners of the contest range from a recreation of the Mafia party game to an aerial combat game mode.[12] The contest winners have been included in Garry's Mod with their own Steam Achievements.[13] Three of the winning games have been shipped, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Dogfight Arcade, and Prop Hunt. On September 7, 2010, Newman added a feature called the "Toybox" to Garry's Mod.[15] It utilizes the Amazon S3 service to download third party content, such as weapons, props, maps, game modes or models, directly to the users' machine while in game. In an interview with GMod news, Garry Newman said that "One of GMod's biggest draws is the amount of third party content. I want to make it easier for people to utilize that. I really want to move away from having to download files from websites and drag them to folders, thats old school. So thats what Im heading towards. Maps, models, saved games etc., all saved on the cloud and accessible with a click. Everything should be accessible from in-game. If it isnt, Ive failed
Finwey;-;OH MY GOD WHERE HAS MY LIFE GONE THIS GAME IS JUST SOO AAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11

Mary Fields;-;This game is great fun if you like screwing around in sandbox. It has great game modes like TTT, Prophunt, Murder and more. It has plenty of great addons in the workshop as well. I definitely recommend this game if you like sandbox, screwing around, and building.

MultiKelvin |;-;This game is and amazing Sanbox game! It has many games in one! But the only problem is that u need textures for the game from CSS, Half Life 2, Portal, L4D2, TF2 and more..
2 <3 Gar;-;By far other than Minecraft best game EVER!!!!!! A MUST GET.
Octomelon;-;Garrys Mod is great as a multiplayer experience. It's fun to mess around with friends, build contraptions, and battle each other. Exploring and manipulating content from your favourite supported games is great too. There are also lots of gamemodes that you can play, which arguably turn Garrys Mod into a number of smaller games in their own right (i.e 'Murder' which is basically like a violent first-person Cluedo). To say that Garrys Mod is a one-size-fits-all roleplay, shooter, building game, etc, etc is pushing it a bit. You can do all of those things, but often in a watered down way... to get the most out of the game, drop any expectations and go with the flow. Embrace the wacky physics, open freedom, and virtually endless user-created content. It's the best, and at times, iest game you never knew you needed. It's the quintessential Steam sandbox game.
Tierison;-;Buy this game or you will not enjoy your life :P

Baconator;-;There is so much to do on this game I literally think I'm going to be playing this in about 80 years. I hope I live that long, I feel depressed knowing I may not be able to play GMod for that long.
ChackenBurd;-;Allah Akbar, death to the infedels!
mationn;-;Garry's Mod is one of those games that everyone has and everyone should have. You really can do whatever you want with it and is amazing with friends.
Bunny404;-;One of the best games i've ever played. Very versatile, you can do basically anything you set your mind to. Wanna make a vehicle? You can do that. Wanna pose characters? You can do that. Wanna slaughter combines? Got it. Wanna slap Gman? ....Got that too.
SmashingEmeraldz;-;Garry's Mod is an extremely fun game, because it functions mostly on workshop addons you can turn it into amost anything you want. However because anything besides the normal sandbox vertion of the game need other textures from games that also run Source you need to own about half the games valve makes. So, if you wish to play Garry's Mod it would be best to own most of the games in the valve complete pack. Normally this is around $100 but goes on sale for $25 every few months. So I would suggest waiting until the valve complete pack goes on sale and buying it along with Garry's Mod. All of the games that I have played in the valve complete pack are extrememly fun anyway so youll want to own them just to play anyway.

Shadow;-;best game ever. can do anything, be anything, your imagination is the limit!
Toasty;-;one Awesome Game / Mod
B4;-;Awesome game. Had to fix it to get it to work on Linux properly though.
Corndog;-;One of my favourite games on Steam. It's only 5.99, and with literally hundreds of thousands of add-ons and custom gamemodes, it's definitely worth the price for the amount of fun you can have on it. You may want to get a group of friends together to play it at first as some of the tools can be hard to use, but after an hour or two, you can make anything you want, with a few Youtube guides maybe.
Mr President;-;This is by far my favorite steam sandbox game! With the server aspect it allows you to play with all of your friends and have tons of fun with strangers. Personally my favorite gamemode in it is Jailbreak but thats my opinion, theres also TTT which is loads of fun, Deathrun and MUCH MUCH more!!!! I highly suggest this game to everyone who wants to have fun.
Mquin1026;-;that was the best game i ever played thank you for making it Awosme
Kukli Style *TRADING*;-;Made a giant  with barrels and put wheels and thrusters on it then ran over some gas mask dudes. 10/10
thomas1up;-;Garry's Mod, the reason I got steam, the reason I joined the glorious PC master race! Garry's Mod isn't a game in the traditional sense, you aren't put somewhere and given a goal, you are given many tools and pretty much can do whatever the  you want! Wanna build a rocket ship? Go ahead! Wanna create a movie? Go ahead! Wanna create a porno in it? Uhh that's a bit weird... but go ahead! The possibilities are ENDLESS, there's soo much to do, and this is just the single player experience, don't forget the hundreds of Game Modes like DarkRP, Surf, Flood, PirateShipWars, StopItSlender the list goes on, if you can, BUY THIS GAME!
dvd_robles;-;This is one of the best games I've ever played and will keep on playing until i get bored or start playing something better.
Frosty;-;Garrys mod is a good game to play with friends and have Some fun and a giggle also there loads of things to chosse.

PuppyBurns;-;This game cured my herpes.
QueenPirateBae;-;One of my favorite games on steam! I love the mods in the workshop and playing with my friends.
Destroy All Weebs;-;This game is great to kill time in. Build giant  out of propane tanks and barrels, or drive a car around and ram Spongebob into a house you just made out of ragdolls. 9.5/10
Mega Houndoom;-;This game is for people who like diversity. As in the name, there are many mods in the game like Trouble in Terrorists town, in which you try to figure out who is the enemy, or go on a bloodthirsty rampage. Mods like DarkRP and 1982RP makes it so that you roleplay with many others. Then there is the famous sandbox, where you can create demon zombies, pool parties and even terrorist dinosaurs! I give this game 9 out of 10 stars.
PlezRekMyRectum;-;Want to f&@# around with your friends and never get bored, like ever? THEM GET GARRY'S MOD. Have to option to play regular sandbox and let your imagination run wild with your friends, like ride pink rocket , or explore the millions of maps, gamemodes, and NPC character addons all for free to download in the steam workshop. You'll NEVER get bored, it's worth every penny, trust me.
Stickz;-;This Game is The Best Game On Earth You Can Let Your Creativity Fly Free! :D
KoopZ;-;10/10 I am 100% Honest. You can simply do ANYTHING in Garry's mod! Get some addons like PAC3 and Wiremod, PlayX and some cool npc's and guns. Then you can have fun for HOURS. Simply the best game on earth...
Porta;-;THis game is good with friends. It's AWESOME with your best friends. It's EPIC when you have tons of brains and contraptions and friends. Even the separate mods are great like: Sledbuild, Floodmod, Zombie Survival etc
Creepy Lil' Llama;-;The best sandbox ever created
TTM~Ferrerman1;-;Wanna know how good of a game it is? Just check my hours on here.... + Achievements
Clucker2808;-;One of my favorite games of all time. Mainly because it isnt just one game, as there are many mods that turn it into other games. It could be a fun RP game, or a Sled building racer, or a Prop Hunt game. I also love all the fun maps that the communtiy makes, its fun to run around a Horror map with a friends, or have a nuclear war in a large desert with lots of secret areas.
Wislyd;-;One of the best sandbox games I have ever played. The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing, and it's just a lot of fun to play. Highly recommended.

lilpannda;-;Do you love being creative, clever, and prefer to play with friends? If so, this is the game for you! This is by far my most favorite game in my inventory. There is so much to do you will never get bored!!
gio;-;Well if you really want a really nice game and didn't make you get bored? this is the game, with alot of contribution flowing thru the workshop, the game's content is filling constantly, you make stuff, contribute stuff, pretty much anything. And there's tons of billion gamemodes to keep you interested in game while you didn't know what to make in sandbox, plat Trouble in Terrorist Town and be super suspicious, play RP and life as a citizen, police, robberm gangster, and even headcrabs on some server. Playing alone will get you bored, get a friend and you'll have some more fun, pretty much worth the bucks since this game makes me addicted to it, man I wish i could use wiremod :P
Rainbowcat;-;I've played >1000 hours. Still best game in steam.
FAK;-;World's BEST game! I love to play this online, and or with my friends. This game is basically the best game ever! <3
SpringHeelJack;-;Love the game, spent many hour on lots of gamemodes so get the game if you want to have fun!!!! or be creative even. This game is a work of genius, but before getting it, read these warnings, it could happen to you!: i had a life before i played Gmod, it ruined my college life after i played Gmod, i lost my girlfriend bcoz of Gmod, i gained weight bcoz of Gmod, i lost my job bcoz of Gmod, i want to leave Gmod but i cant escape playing Gmod, 10,000 hours on my account and i still want to play Gmod, my beard is big as hell bcoz i play Gmod, i want to quit,but i cant quit Gmod, its all true! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ BEWARNED YOU MAY LOSE YOUR LIFE DUE TO GMOD!

Garsh;-;It's really awesome
HippyHagrid;-;It's a very good game, I mostly play it with friends since it's a bit boring on your own, there isn't much to review about the game directly since it's mostly the community that helps develop it, my favourite types of servers are the theaters as it's funny as hell when someone plays a good video.
Cristir;-;A bag of doritos driving a lamborghini through minecraft, great
MajesticHazard;-;You can't resist the awesomeness of this game!
bronckr;-;i found this very hard to masturbe to, but is a cool game
CupaCake;-;This game is very unique (im sorry if some of my spelling is wrong hehe) i would recommend this game to anyone. i first came across garrys mod when my bro started to play it ages ago and then a couple of years later i watched some awesome youtubers play TTT and prop hunt and hide and seek. i then wanted to get the game to try it out for myself and my gosh its amazing iv created some wierd and wonderful things with friends , iv played on horror maps wich are quite good, and iv been online playing prop hunt etc which i love. The servers iv been on so far are very friendly and dont just stick on the same map. so i give this game 11/10 and 5 stars. iv only been playing on it for a few months now and still have so much to discover.
StuffedDonut;-;This game is amazing. I've spent 180 hours pkaying this game and i dont regret any of it. This game is the game ive been looking for! In this game the only limit is your imagination (and your computer) 10 OUT OF 5

ZeroStressLevel;-;An awesome Sandbox game. :D
Gary;-;Very addicting! This game is for all people, no matter whta you want to do, this game is capable of giving what you want. If you want to hunt for hidden people disguised as objects, this is for you. (Prop Hunt.) If you wish to roleplay as a variety of characters in emersive areas. (Roleplay [Clockwork]) If you wish to stand along with Traitors, unaware who wants to kill you. (Trouble In Terrorist Town) This is just a few of hundreds of different gamemodes, allowing anyone to have fun.

Croiss;-;Half Life 2 Sandbox! 8/10
Odatruh;-;Garry's Mod= Do whatever you please. This game is just amazing, create ANYTHING!!
Ken Snyder;-;Wow, this game really changed the life of Ken Snyder. I have so many fans that play this game and they all sent me messages saying "Oh man, Ken bro dude man bro you gotta play this game!" And since my good pals Rob Schneider, Willem Dafoe, and Bob Saget were already on this beyotch I got naked and hopped right on this sexy celeb gang bang of a video game. This game is love, this game is life. Sometimes while playing on the Golden Boys TTT server I feel tingly feelings down below. One time on here I saw a beautiful lady so I had on my fuuuuucking fedora and I kissed her. Then the golden boys and I all got together with her and we smoked a little meth and gang banged her. I really have to say not only has this game made my already mad beyotch game stronger, it's broughten me closer to the only men I could ever love. So thank you Gmod, you've made my life for the better. I wish I could write for hours, but I have more Gmod to play with the Golden Boys. If you think you have what it takes to be a Hollywood Golden Boy hit me and Rob Schneider up. <3 8=====D With love, Ken Snyder <3 8====D~~~~
LightWolf;-;This game is really fun! You can do really much with this game. You can make stuff that's either wierd and fun or you can make big constructions etc. But this is just a little part of it. When you buy the game you have different game-modes like Trouble in Trerrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Sandbox, Stop It Slender, Gmod Zombie survival (something like that) and more! And you can play alone if you feel like not playing online. !!(But to get most of the textures you need Counter Strike Source, The Half Life series, TF 2 and I'm not sure but I alsow think you need some textures from Left 4 dead 2, but again I might be mistaking. But if you don't want to spend more money you can find some of the textures in the workshop)!!
Gangsta Kitten;-;This game is illogical, stupid, random, and has absolutely no purpose whatsoever. I love it. Highly reccomended!
Glangar;-;Love this game because it's basically a bunch of amazing games put together for a low price!
burd;-;Gary mod is a mod dat gary maed, nd he maed viry gud mod. I lleik gary cuz he giv me god teim on gaim cuz litl kidz hav very lots of fun but den i com dere to hav moar fun so dat maeks litl kidz mad so i get very fun hapy tiem.
SnanS;-;Garry's Mod is a sandbox game where anything is possible.Their is always someone making addons or tools ect. , and this game is also good if you want to make a machinama or wana animate without using Sorce Film Maker.This is one game you will never get bored of.
oip;-;you can spawn potatoes, very nice and tasty potatoes
khan14327;-;i play this game alot people who dont hae need to get it
AlphaOmegaX [NGHQ];-;There is no reason to not have this game if you have 10 dollars to spare. You can do almost anything you want- just go and play to your heart's content.
Seor Boris 'The Rock' Johnson;-;8/10, broken physics are fun.
Impossibru;-;fun game specially with friends :)
Dark Shockwave;-;My playtime will review this game ^^^
Deathicon;-;This game is very fun to mess around with :) and really entertaining :) never gets boring :D
[SK] Vrexort;-;For having 650+ hours on this game I can fairly say my opinion without any bias's. It's a great game as long as you know who you're playing with and the server owner that you play on. Really that's it. Pros: Amazing amount of selection for the cost, so many servers to try you're bound to like one. Cons: You must have cs:s to play correctly without errors *Unless you download homebrew textures or resources which I would not trust. Really that's the only one.
MeowMiau343;-;few minutes play the game,.. few hours finding the mod,.. . 10/10 would not miss all the fun
Gix;-;Garry's mod. You can do whatever you want in this game: make flying bath tubs, make funny animations and build whatever you have in your brain. most fun is in the co-op with your friends. this is most creative game i have ever played.
GODZILLA!!!;-;love this game so much
GDa;-;Love the game. Hate da ppl. 11/10 best ball eating simulator
Lysdal;-;Really fun game. You get to build stuff, and there's tons of addons. You can build anything you would like, and there are tons of different gamemodes.
A Real Human Bean;-;The book was better.
Your mom;-;it is a must buy
Your mom;-;it is a must buy
Cuck;-;I don't know what to do in this game and it scares me.
Pinooy;-;buy it, play it, you wont regreat it
FlyingRaisins;-;It has watermelons
Princess_kenny;-;fun for messing around but i dislike how almost all prop hunt servers have different buttons to switch props and how every ttt server is that one minecraft map, even though i like the map
Pennon;-;This game is probably my favourite, sadly it is not as good as cory in the house which is the best game ever made and ever will be made.
Miya;-;This game is one of the best sandbox games you'll find in the entirety of gaming. Gmod is a game designed to build and play. Ranging from using various objects to create bathtub catapults, office supply sleds, buildings made entirely of boats, whatever you want to build is yours. Not only is there building, there's also playing with a varieity of gamemodes like Gmod Tower (A Big Gamemode Hub and hangout!), Trouble in Terrorist Town (Find the bad players!), Prop Hunt (find the players disgused as objects in the area!), etc., it's one of the best games to play period.
KeyboardCat;-;It's a nice sandbox ( do whatever the  you want ) type of game. Good if you are into hanging out with some friends playing several types of minigaems.
PowerPlug;-;Garrys Mod, a very large game by Facepunch Studios. It gives you the power to do so much and yet it always ends the same way, with blood splattered on the walls. To describe Garrys Mod is hard but possible, and in sections is the best way to do it. Garrys Mod is all about creation, it was originally designed as a sandbox game, where you can spawn hundreds of props in, weld them together and make incredible things. But that was a long time ago and Garrys Mod isnt just a game for welding things, now you can use winches, rope, hover balls, emitters, and a very large assortment of weapons. The game requires a few other games to be installed to see everything though. Source Mod games, the minimum amount of games youll need to see the most are the games; Team Fortress 2, Counterstrike: Source and Half Life: Source. The game can still be played without them but is better with them, you can spawn in props and characters from those games too. If you like the medic from TF2 why not rebuild the Meet The Medic video clip. Over the years of people playing around with Garrys Mod extra game modes were born; Spacebuild (original mod removed), Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt, DarkRP, Sled Build, Bomber Man and many more. These game modes change the way Garrys Mod played, from once a game about welding to watermelons together and then blowing them up, to thing like finding a traitor and killing him, running from a knife wielding murderer, hiding as a pot plant in the snow and dropping explosive watermelons hoping to win the game. Apart from the sandbox, hundreds of servers and many game modes; Garrys Mod also has Steam Workshop support so you can share your creations, download others and play with them or even change the way the game plays like getting a tool that lets you change the weight of an object, a tool that makes props larger or smaller, a gun that shoots Nyan Cats and nuclear bombs you can strap to awesome looking cars that have thrusters stuck to its rear and have a big ramp in front of it hoping to make a big bang so to speak. If youre the type of person who likes building things, this is for you. If youre the type of person who likes killing people, this is for you. If youre the type of person who likes running into a war zone with balloons stuck to your ears then this is for you. This game is incredible and fits almost everyones needs; horror, sandbox, building, strategy, comedy and more. If I were to follow my normal rules for reviewing games and rating them out of 10. Id be lowering the rating millions of times over to make it low enough to fit. It is extremely fun and the rating 10/10 is an understatement.
[GoDs]-[];-;Do you like to create? Do you like to destroy? Do you like stuff? Well then Garry's Mod is for you! You can build just about ANY THING! If you can imagine it, You can build it! Tons of Maps for all different gamesmodes! You can even get some addons! Some of the addons could be: New/Custom Weapons New/Custom Maps New/custom (S)NPC's New/Custom Ragdolls More/Better Tools to help you build! And Much MUCH more!
Be Back August 14th!;-;LOVE IT
SoapResidue;-;this game has taken over my life. i divorced my husband because he refused to allow me to play for more than 8 hours a day. i have stopped all communication with family and friends except the ones on gmod. all in all, great game 10/10.
{OvO} Osit;-;The greatest and most addicting game you will ever play.
Jazz is Gonna Get Yall;-;this game is very good apart from some servers being abit laggy and sometimes takes a while to load but apart from that it is a good game. very fun
Boris;-;Ace game, deffinately a buy.
Bholm;-;this was a really good third person shooter i loved the part when nico bellic killed the guy who betrayed him.
tehctaH;-;Threw a krabby patty at a player and killed him. 10/10
Syntax_error;-;Definitely one of the most fun games of ever played.. Especially with friends :D
Taco Man IXx;-;oh my gosh gmod is epic (: i love it you guys would enjoy it
Antique Doorknob;-;Garrys Mod, Uhhh where to start. I personally love this game. The physics are just.. I dont know anymoar. If you like humourous creations. And lots of gamemodes, This is the game for you. I dont know what makes this game so funny, Could it be over the 100+ gamemodes they have? Or just the fact that you could build the silliest things evar on here. If I had the money I would buy there company. There income is so great. Just because of this silly game. Its nearly impossible to not laugh while on this game. I enjoy this game so much. I just cant express how well put-up this game is. Which leaves me to say. BUY GMOD BEST GAME EVAR 2K14 720NOSCOPECOLLATORALWALLBANG. !!Gg No re!! All humor aside. Buy this game. This is a true experience. And I mean it.
Squid Kid;-;this game is filled with autism it is fun if you troll the brony  and stupid fat kids
Gamingwatt25;-;this game is really adicting igahgapiufdg
[DFG]Ze-Neko-Noney;-;Garrys mod is one of the best sand box games ive ever played to date i have played more then 2000 hours on it, needless to say that is a metric  ton cubed. if you think 2000 hours isnt a lot i have friends with 4000-12,000 hours on this lovely game. if you enjoy having fun for countless hours fighting against traitors or zombies, maybe even a murderer... sometimes even chasing after a rouge prop on prophunt, or building a boat and fighting to the death with other vikings in "flood" this game is just the thing for you
JgerBomb;-;Very fun and interesting game! I r8 8/8! :D
Mr.Buttons;-;verry fun game :D Had so much fun with friends. !
Red Spartan;-;this is the best sandbox game ever. good multiplayer game too
-{JOKE}-Lego Scorpool;-;Like minecraft but not too much water-IGN 10/10
KawaiiYogurt;-;This is the most OVER 9000 game i have played since i was born PS: Children under 12 are in every server
Johnners;-;One of the best sandbox games out there, if you own alot of valve games and are into building crazy contraptions or just messing arround with npc's then this game is for you!
FaZe Hector de Stoeipoes;-;It's a really nice and large game, you have much gamemodes and much fun Worth the 2.50 euro in sales.
~Meep~;-;In my opinion this is a great game and is great to socailise... cheers yall
{FA} Baker;-;Very Fun "Game". I Hesitate To Call Garry's Mod A Game As It's More Of A Virtual Toy. With No Limits You Can Build Neat Contraptions, Role Play, Or Play Various Game Modes. Worth Every Last Penny. Only Gripe Is That For Certain Game Modes, Other Source Engine Games Are Required, Such As Counter Strike Source For Most Roleplay Servers. Hours Of Fun Are To Be Had, From Dicking Around In The Half Life 2 Campaign, Fighting Your Friends In Deathmatch, Building Cars, Catapults, And Many Other Constructs In Sandbox, Or Anything Inbetween, Garry's Mod Can Do That.
The Original Sporzo;-;Wooo!! Seen this on youtube so many times. Glad i Bought it. This was inspired from Vanossgamings. He's the reason why Im playing this.
A Kind Buttery Potato;-;The most customizable game that I have seen. It has everything, and you can add more, from Half Life 2 vechicles to THIS... IS... SPARTA! The biggest sandbox game so far. With hundreds of gamemodes and thousands of addons that you can put five more hours of gameplay into per addon, you will never be bored by this stunning combination of build-it-yourself singleplayer and fantastic fan-made multiplayer. You will find yourself inserting months into this game, and you will be hooked on it for years, as new updates come out to make it even better. In all honesty, if you would love to put years of your time into a game, this would be the one for you.
JdoggIsPcdrummerJr;-;Great game. Fun to play when bored
Blanc (White Heart);-;It's a good game.
Mayu c:;-;So I was demonstrating this game to my girlfriend when I decided to set a patrick star ragdoll on fire. At first we laughed at the sight of a large pink starfish being roasted alive then we threw it off into the distance. I carried on demonstrating the other various wonders of garry's mod and forgot about poor Patrick Star until ten minutes later when he suddenly cartwheeled across the screen and we both fell on the floor laughing hysterically for 5 minutes. 420/69 would set patrick on fire again
egon.wendelken;-;gmod the game there you can do everything!I ever wish i have a where i can do everything now i have it its so cool!
TheTerva;-;Garry's Mod - the game of all games! I love this game! I mean, there's so much to do! In fact, nothing is impossible in Garry's Mod. You need other Source games for it to work properly though. (but then again, who doesn't own a Source game?)
Doppler;-;this is probably the best $10 i've ever spent this game has more to offer than any triple A game you can create your own weapons and games and have fun with your friends on your own server or other severs from sandbox to prop hunt this game is one of the best god damn games i've ever played!
[SnS]killer piggy;-;very great game. it has alot of different game mode you'll probably like atleast one. as of right now trouble in terrorist town and darkRP are the most popular. i have 800+ hours. 300 hours in one server alone.
Theboobinaterz;-;If I don't give this a 10/10 I will be killed by anyone and everyone on steam. It's a must get game if you own steam and like to  around. 10/10
FaizAuu #AwayUntilWednesday;-;More than 50 games in Garry's Mod!
Aperturenc;-;awesome game. you can put everything into garry's mod, but you can't put garry's mod into everything.
Majestic swan of Majesty;-;15/10!!! BEST GAME EV3R! reason???: funnt glitches, physics, f***ing around basicly. thing i do nt like: you need CS:S HL2 EP1 or EP2 for some iotems.
rage;-;Made many great friends and messes here. 10/10
SabrinaBuns;-;This is...possibly the reason I barely passed chem 10/10 <3
ViciiousPanda;-;If you are looking for a game do just do anything! this is the game there are so many diffrent game modes you can play and sandbox where you can do anything if its in a game its on this game for you to mess around with! highly recommend!
MikaiL;-;fun but not boring but not too much bored idk what to say bye.
GruM;-;Admin disables noclip spawn a fridge jump on it lift it F*ck your rules Admin, I'll fly anyway
MrOuldy;-;I would recommend this game because it really brings creativity to mind and a lot of fun. If you want to create something on your own. You can do that. Private server? Easy. Need more friends? Easy join servers. This games brings loads to the plate but one down side is that if you want most of the textures you need Counter Strike Source which will expand the limit of your playing ablility.
Nabik;-;>Got on DarkRP server >RDM'd people >9 year olds screeched at me >Got Banned i r8 8/8 much b8 m8 if u like dank memes u will love this game like this review for pepe the frog
KING TIT SPRINKLE DICK JOHNSON;-;very fun with lots of different game modes and funny moments. worth the money

Get Garry's Mod. Like video games? Get Garry's Mod.
Rogue Cheney [Away on Holiday];-;If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob a bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.
Hans;-;i wish i had more time to try this game out altered roleplay is the best community ever tho
Star_Hawk_;-;Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway. "Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm... _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more. _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore. _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds. _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want. _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10 Overall 8.5 Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

Valiantttt;-;Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

You can be anything you want in GMOD.

(when squeakers are not around... please sell your mic) Must buy!
Renegader;-;Limitless possibilities in Garry's Mod! With user-generated modifications you literally do have a 'new' experience each time you turn on your PC.

SimplyABear;-;Awesome game. Great for expeiriments.
WindWaker;-;Ok, This Game Is AMAZING, the ability for creating and doing anything you choose! If its making a contraption, playing with ragdolls, or just roleplaying.

Kawaii Fvck | Rayne;-;Did it for the badge
NorCon;-;Garry's Mod. Well first of all lets just say this game is not confined to just 1 game type. It is EVERYTHING! From TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) to Murder!

Latios ();-;Very fun sandbox game, with even more than that gamemode, examples are DarkRP or something like that. Yes that. But the addons, you can add a lot of things. It's one of the best parts. The best part is that you can mess with the ragdoll's faces.
Armyconrad;-;Great Game. Plenty Of Workshop Items To Keep You Intertained For A Long TIme.
TigerStark;-;Joins a DARK RP server. Becomes Hitman. A miner comes and tells me that theres is a bug that allows you to get uranium everytime you hit a rock. Becomes miner. Does what he said.

Cold Fusion;-;Garry's Mod is a very clever creation in the Source Engine, I should know, I've spent an excess of 4,100 hours playing it. Combined with the workshop, Half-Life 2, and sandbox, this game ranks with Minecraft.
MetelStairs;-;Fun allround

Dorramu;-;Gmod is a fun game with lots of different game modes. So if you love sanbox, mystery and action this is the game for you!
Pel at E3;-;Great game, a lot of room for imagination. Don't expect the community to show off many brain cells though.
Mary Fields;-;This game is great fun if you like screwing around in sandbox. It has great game modes like TTT, Prophunt, Murder and more. It has plenty of great addons in the workshop as well. I definitely recommend this game if you like sandbox, screwing around, and building.
Harrison Wells;-;its great game
scatter;-;...why do i have miku hatsune player models.....
CarlosDaBucha;-;Garry's Mod is a sandbox game. This game has just saying "Here's a map, now go and just raise hell or do whatever the poopfart you want. Garry's mod give you the tools and you do create anything with those tools. You could spawn objects or create your very own item. Its your world, go screw around with it.

Wazzy97;-;Very good and funny game :D And I very recommend it :) and when playing with friends is it better :D
NewSquidGrater;-;Okay, so my last review was short. So here's a longer, more detailed version. When it comes to sandboxes, nothing beats Garry's Mod. Content: Garry's Mod has a huge variety of content, even without the workshop items. The amount of stuff you can make depends on how much you have. You're armed with the usual set of Half-Life 2 weapons,along with a few legit gmod stuff, the Physgun, the Camera, and a Tool gun. It already comes with one of the Half-Life 2 episodes. And that's a bonus. Not happy with the usual Source ragdolls? You can get some non-source ragdolls via the Workshop! Cause there's even more stuff at the Workshop; Sonic, Minecraft, and Mario stuff! You can also change your player model using the Context menu Gameplay: As I said before, you're equipped with HL2 weapons, exceptions are Physgun, Camera, and Toolgun. You can do anything you want, whether it's catapulting a ragdoll from Left 4 Dead 2, or facing a wave of Combine soldiers from Half-Life 2. You can also spawn props and such and make a neat movie. Just be aware of what you're doing. Your imagination is the limit! Concerns & Problems: Hold on a sec, don't buy it yet, as there is some problems with this.This may be an excellent game, but there is some concerns. One being that there is WAY too many dupes. I mean, look up Terraria in the Workshop, and as you can see. There is alot of Demon Eyes, Eye of Cthulhus, and Twins and , and nothing of a real addon, can't they do us a favor create a Minecraft-ish sprite of Terraria items, at the VERY LEAST!? But if you're making a movie, then this problem is easily solvable with a little Sony Vegas. Another concern is that not everything you might like is on the Workshop. I.E. I looked up ROBLOX on the Workshop, and, like Terraria, pure dupes. The only real addon is a somewhat glitchy NPC, and when I type in something that'll get it to walk right, it really slows my PC down. Another example would be that the Super Monkey Ball ragdolls do NOT support the Bone Merger Tool. They're a little small I that I might understand, but it would be nice if they too, could be in the hat-wearing buisness. The most serious thing you might wanna know too, is that this game relies HEAVILY, on Source games. You won't have Louis having his pills on Gmod without Left 4 Dead 2. Nor have Gordon Freeman without one of the Half-Life 2 games. A screenshot example of what happens when you don't have Counter Strike: Source can be seen here. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=268005543 So before getting the game, make sure you have the nessecary amount of games that use the Source Engine. Here is the priority of what games you might need, in my point of view. 1. As many Half-Life games as possible. 2. Counter Strike, probably any, but peferrably Source. 3. Left 4 Dead 2 4. Portal 5. Team Fortress 2 and etc. The reason I put TF2 on 5# is because that it's free. So there is little need to have that ASAP. But then again, if you're planning to use TF2 ragdolls most of the time, then that makes sense. Just remember that this my opinion, so your priorities may vary. Final thoughts: Garry's Mod offers alot of content for you to play around with. But if you don't have many Source games, then it could be a problem. But if you don't plan on using so many things, then again. If you're a guy looking to mess around with stuff, or feeling creative, then this, is your opportunity. The cost is well worth it, especially since that I'm writing this during the Steam Summer Sale 2014. But really, the amount you should shell out, varies on how many Source games you have, how often are you gonna play with it, and how good is your imagination, and creativity. For example, if you only have TF2, but don't plan on playing Gmod often, due to your lack of imagination, and creativity, then don't buy it without a REALLY cheap price. But if you have CS:S, HL2, and L4D2, and really wanna see what you can do, and do plan on playing it for a huge time pattern, then yes, it is worth full price. So the verdict is in, Garry's Mod: NOT sucks ! 8/10 happy ragdolls here.
Rosa;-;my sreen is soo short its not wider like it used to be help
Udop1;-;Best game ever. Amazing for creative minds to make something new. :3
ViP.OLOFMEISTER;-;BEST GAME EVER 10/10 I HAD SO MUCH FUN BUT IF U WANNA PLAY PRIVATE WITH SOMEONE I RECOMMEND HAMCHI
Techno Wolf (RIP - Satoru Iwata);-;This game is an excellent animation tool if you have the right addons. The community has plenty of gamemodes to offer, and you can make tons of stuff. HIGHLY recommended.
Chimchim;-;All you do in this game is use a physics gun that allows you to move entities with a laser beam. It is unrealistic because of this. The game is futuristic but all of the game modes are based in the past, like 1942RP. If they do not have physics guns now then why would they be there in the past?! Hitler was a smart man but c'mon lets be real here... Hitler would have not killed himself if he knew about a physics gun. He would probably have just grabbed some space nukes from the Gbomb addon and then smashed it into the ground onto UK and Russia. Then he would have just said "LOL ur bad kid. git guud." and then crysterbate due to his victory. In the end, I would give this game a solid 2/10 because I am on the #road2silver2
The_Horseless_Headsman;-;Became Morgan Freeman. Pulled out Portal Gun. Placed 2 Portals and did the infinite loop. Pulled out Nyan Cat Gun. Shot a Creeper. Threw a train into a lake. Shot Nyan Cats at the train. Train blew up. 10/10 Only possible in Garry's Mod
MarcelKaponoTV;-;Its good
[FS] Dark Iron Blade;-;Highly Recommended, so much to do in this game :D Only issue I have with it is loading times, but otherwise I love it. Also you need to have some other Valve games installed & downloaded, such as Counter-Strike Source so you don't end up with missing textures in gmod.
vatha the Khudriag-Ata;-;Recommended to have atleast 20 gb for this game, cause it's eating memory like a ing monster.
Mexicano;-;You cant really say anything about this game, because the game is the top of all games...
Depth;-;Its as if Jefferey Dahmer, Kanye West, Doctor Who, and Miley Cyrus had one BIG sex tape and put it in a game.
Pacotaco651;-;its a game within a game within a game within a game within a game within a game within a game within a game within a game within a game within a game
Kryptic;-;The Game where you get shot in the head by a melon with a nuclear warhead launcher then  by batman... 50/10 Would buy again
Geomire;-;This game does not have a goal unless you want it to. It really doesn't matter what you do unless you have run out of creativity completly :). Garry's Mod allows you to build, shoot, drive and simulate essentially anything you want. Community add-ons make infinite variabilities and there are several servers with different modes. Highly recommended.
BOT Raykou;-;The diversity of game modes in Garry's Mod is so large that I will die before I get to play each one.
Mako;-;I can easily say this is the best game i've ever played. You can do anything. 10/10 You can easily rack up 1000+ hours on this game.
JellyBunny~;-;sand box, very creative, good for creative minds and so much more
[pG] Gravious;-;It's uhh... good. With voice_enable 0, of course.
Shifter110;-;This game is great for one's creativity.
F[A]ll3n[A]nG3L;-;One of the best games in Steam ! :)
General-Lee;-;trust me you wont regret buying this game!
The King Of Scotland;-;This game is a whole crap ton of fun
Tapeey;-;This game makes it's money back in a day. Mindlessly entertaining and a great outlet to talk to your e-friends and make new ones. good game
Captain Luther;-;BEST. GAME. EVER!!!! Garry's Mod is amazing. Garry is a genius. Garry's Mod is literally the first game that I never even a little bit regretted buying. This game is amazing. If you like Minecraft, you'll get into Garry's Mod and be like, what do you even do? And then you'll build a vehicle out of bathtub and then make a turret and then get a bunch of mods and then roleplay and then get 500 hours on the game like me. You can trust me on this. Garry's Mod EXPERTISE. I think that's how you spell it... Anyways, best $10.00 I've ever spent! (I actually got it at a sale for $5.00.) Roleplaying in this game is amazing, get some silly playermodels from the workshop and then be like, I'm spiderman! And then you'll want to restart the server because you want a spiderman gun mod. Best sandbox game in the world. Garry's Mod makes me notice how cool source engine is. Especially ragdolls. Once you get the game (as I said, it IS a must get.) you'll start being like, "I got an idea! Let's get Frozen Elsa and Anna ragdolls from the workshop (there's a million Frozen mods so this is the easiest example.) and then fight with them and make epic scenes like Elsa dramatically jumping from an explosion or make Anna's head big and then turn into a spaceship. A lot of sandbox games are like, (read this in a stupid voice) "Oh, in Minecraft the possibilities are endless!" My reaction: Really? In an E 10+ game? All you can do in Minecraft is see pictures and play adventure maps that have EPIC builds and then get all inspired and then you'll be like, I'm going to make the best Minecraft mansion ever! And then you build crap and then you cry. But in Garry's Mod, Garry's Mod Garry's Mod Garry's Mod... you can freakin shoot people, roleplay, make machinimas, (you can in Minecraft too but they're crap unless you animate it.) you can even (as I said before) make a vehicle out of a bathtub! (True story. I did it once.) Garry's Mod is amazing. Minecraft is crap. Oh! I just got an idea. The new name is... Minecrap! Yeah, that's clever... AND WHAT THE HELL?! Minecraft is a freaking like $35.00! I can name like more than 50 games (kind of over exadurating more of like 20) that are better than Minecrap! And the first is Garry's Mod. I bet there's someone reading this being like Minecraft's cool... Well, I ask you this Minecrap Fan. Have you ever built anything in Minecrap that isn't comeplete rubbish? Sorry. This is a Garry's Mod review. Not a Minecrap one. Well, but there you have it. Like 2 reasons I think why I hate Minecrap. And one is a big reason. And if you don't know that by now your probably a Minecrap Fan because you skipped the part about Minecrap.
DISCIPLE1337;-;One of the best PC games where you can have fun we friends and randoms.
brutal99;-;I don't even know where to start with this game... This game you can put in 500 hours and not even play one fifth of the game it's a sandbox which lets people make their own game modes, rules, models, maps, scripts, weapons, structures... Its amazing! It's fun on TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) Muder (Basically Michael Myers) Death Run (A very Fun Competitive game mode) Sandbox (Do what ever you feel like doing) Dark RP (A very well Role Playing its very sketchy lead twards the name chosen for it "Dark RP") there is about 100 more game modes that are really fun by this game it's only like $10.00 and get some friends to play it with you it makes it even better :D 5/5
GreatKids;-;Really fun, if your looking for a game this is the one.
SmileDipHD;-;this game has such amazing features were it has infinite possibilities of gameplay and creativity. 10/10
BradAndrews435;-;I've played it for over 5000 hours... Eh, its alright I suppose...

Forte;-;This game have everything you need and want to have fun and to make your own fun with friends. Only way you can get bored of this game and not enjoy it, if you don't have a creative mind.
Varneon #Miragebola;-;Full freedom to do whatever you want, create things whose only limits are your imagination and physics engine.
Nixel;-;All I can say is: BUY. THE. GAME. Actually, that's not all I can say. That would be too much to list here. But I can assure you that at least 85% of the things I could say are positive! Maybe 87%. 90% maybe? I won't go higher than that, though. But I digress. One negative thing is, there's too many glitches. Although most are caused by the community. Which is generally great, though. Definitely worth the money, but it might still be best to wait until it goes on sale. It goes on sale so frequently that that shouldn't take too long. But I digress again. I think I'm gonna make 'I digress' my motto. Dammit, I digress again ! Just put it on your wishlist already!
[CBZ] The Sheep Man;-;I like going on DarkRP servers and propkilling for no good reason and Going on random servers and being called a squeaker and getting kicked and going on the CBZ server with my freinds. 11/10 would do it all again
Zigatron;-;Don't be dumb, buy it.
Lolman;-;This Game is really Awesome becasue there is differnet servers i can play
Lucser;-;Pretty good.
Cr44dy;-;Amazing. Everything you want in 1 game. You can do EVERYTHING. Literally everything. One of the BEST games I got.

SpaceCatMeow;-;stuff and stuff and stuff and mods and stuff. not even sure how much stuff there is but i think its a lot
SaltyPotato;-;Have you ever wanted to play games in a game? Garry's Mod is your game! GMod is a game where you can create your own games, join other games other people build, Have a mic? GMod haves a button to talk with your microphone! Cool, right? Its always fun, and the community.. Well, the community is okay. But not everything is perfect, right? :) And dont start about the mods, they are INCREDIBLE! From Murderer to Prophunt, Gmod has it all! Dont worry about getting bored, that wont happen for anytime soon, i played this for about 11.5hours already, and i loved it all. Community-made games, that is plain awesome! But you can also host a sandbox/mini game, and invite your friends! Lets just say its very good, right? Its worth the money. My rating is 9.5/10
[HM02] GibbyAG;-;Do not play unless you are high.
Sharcey;-;Ruined my life
liev2kill;-;I have almost 500 hours of gametime when im wrighting this review At first i had the css missing textures...(download css) but after that the fun began I have been playing deathrun for over 200 hours i would pay 10$ for even that gamemode only And tons of other game*--  IT JUST BUY THIS GAME ITS 10 F**** BUCKS
Dean Dingus;-;Got forced by my friend to download 20 GBs of mods 69/10 would download 20 Gigs again.
Welldough;-;Very entertaining. It is really fun on its own. If you get bored you can always check the workshop to see if there are any addons that will interest you. The game can be serious and used for roleplays and also just for messing around and blowing things up. Overall I think the game has no flaws and has brought fun to nearly 200 hours of my life.
-{William}-;-;Fun.Awesome.Great. Three Of Millions Of Great Words To Use To Describe This Game
mjcook777;-;social life= destroyed because of this amazing game
[MKN] Mr Pandaxe;-;One time I was playing Gmod and there was crab people attacking me * MUST BUY *
gib me de pusi b0ss;-;Do I even need to say anything about it?
Jippa_Lippa;-;I can make Michael De Santa do the "Hokey Pokey" in this game. Enough Said
NebaG #GoneForHolidays;-;This is basically minecraft with better graphics, gravity, guns and stuff. AMAZING
Puddi Puddi;-;One of the best Steam games hands down.
Cybeast Crimson;-;It's like skyrim with everything
capeandwizard;-;Played it a little, it's pretty good
[PA-D] Dom2364;-;Ive played this for a while, and this is one of those sandbox games that you can just build whatever and make it destroy everything. If you dont want to build random stuff, you could play Trouble in Terrorist Town, or Prop Hunt, or watch youtube in a cinema server, or play sledbuild, or............................ *never ends*
FireWolf [Fluffy!] {Neon};-;Where should i start off... well the bad things about Garry's Mod are the dreaded pink and black missing textures. To fix this, either buy the Counter Strike GO game or get the textures online and copy/paste files. That's pretty much all i can say for the cons of G-mod. There are so many good things about Garry's Mod i cant explain them all in one review so here are some of them: There are many gamemodes to play such as Sandbox [Build whatever you want or kill people], Zombie RP [Roleplay with zombies!], Dark RP [Roleplaying for your satisfaction], Prop Hunt [As a prop, hide somewhere where you wont be seen; As a hunter hunt down the hidden props but watch your health!], and so much more. If you dont like the normal Half Life 2 guns or style of it just go check out the wonderful addons for G-mod! There is so many addons such as TDM Cars [Realistic cars], The Slow Motion Mod [When activated makes everything go in slooooooww moooottiiiiooooon], World War 2 Soldiers [WWII soldiers textures, NPCs, and skins], and so much more. So, there is only one question: "Is it worth my money?" And the answer is "Yes! definetely get it!"
DoctorMelon TheChocolateFurry;-;It's a Nice Game! can play with your Friends have other character from Game Cartoon ragdoll
muffinlicker134;-;awesome building game nice graphics and verry cool that you can put other weapons, npc's, maps and other stuff in youre game
Penezras;-;This game is brilliant You can move around Which is a plus You can shoot things with other things Which is like Woah You can even, like, move things with a thing It blew my mind It was crazy 13/10.6
Jon Snow;-;Where do i even start on this masterpiece i know the fact there is so much to do and so much fun to be had. The charm about Garry's Mod is that you can really do almost anything that comes up on the workshop to subscribe to like a flying bathtub with machine guns. The other thing i like about Garry's Mod is that there are so many servers of different kinds to have fun on with friends like trouble in terroist town (TTT) or deathrun or one of my favouites Gmod Tower on Gmod Tower you can play minigames, get money from that to buy playermodels or hats and even pets to fly around with you, speaking about flying around did i mention you can use a jetpack to get to places faster and if you want to take a break from minigames how about you go to your suite you go and check in and buy stuff to decorate it to your hearts desire or whatever the market has also you can donate to the lovely people who made it happen i am one myself. So my overall rating of Garry's Mod is a 9/10 even better with friends i 100% recommend this game i hope you get it too and have fun.
Luna The Child;-;Best source engine game I've played. Multiple gamemodes, great game. One of my favourites since I started gaming. 9.4 out of 10
general nova;-;garry's mod is GOOD FUN! with no goal or objective this is deeply my type of game and im shure its the same for lots of other people i was simply saying that its an amazing game and i would definatly recomend it.
Nero;-;rdm on ttt and wala insta rage
[U-G] Sam [OWNER];-;This game is ING AWESOME. The graphics are cool, cool animations, you get to use sandbox to build whatever you want, you get gamemodes, rp, spacebuild and loads more!
RussianWinter (The_Muffin);-;Its the best 10$ game ever.
[BSF] GrandAlf;-;Download 100 addons-game crashed.Start Game after 15 downloads game crashed.After that i start the game spawn 1 thing-the game crashed.But ho cares that game is amazing!
FlindoJimbori;-;Amazing sandbox game! This is a great game with a slight learning curve. I recommend geetting this with some of Valve's other source games if you don't already own them. Quote from a friend when asked if he owned Garry's Mod, "Anyone who has a steam account has Garry's Mod."
The Balls That Tickle;-;Yes..Omg yes made a little kid cry on ttt , MLG pro juked my way out of dying in prop hunt and murdered everyone in the blink of in eye in murder...10/10 get it
VerySexySocks;-;Great game. 11/10
JustDark;-;this game is funny and fun 20/10
Polaroid;-;You can create almost anything in Sandbox mode. Makes Ragdolls with ed up faces and ber .
BlackArrow;-;I have spent way to much time on this game, Its amzing how much time you can actually sink into it.
sonic the scout;-;great game
Shylo;-;If you were to get this game I would really recommend getting Counter Strike Source with it.
Ph!LLay;-;I would recomend this game to anyone who cares. And people who enjoy faceposing
Blood;-;Wasted so much time on this. I don't regret it...
Frank Horrigan;-;Fun and creative game, with it being on sale so often, there is no reason not to have it.
Milkman of Wisdom;-;This is a fantastic Sandbox game. With several of its amazing features. from ragdoll posing to making a Combine survival. However, the only flaw I genuinely see is that when I have several addons they seem to conflict with my source game material, with a few glitches here and there, its entirely plausible its just my game however, This game will still provide a large amount of enjoyment.
Marin City Thug;-;Review: Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. The game's makers give you the tools and leave you to play! You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions. You can basically turn Garry's Mod into another game, one example is when I joined a intense Call of Duty server. The TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) servers are amazingly addictive. My Most Favorite Part of Garry's Mod: I really like how you can basically do anything in Garrys Mod. I really like playing on TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) because they are really fun. What I Don't Like About Garry's Mod: There isn't really anything I hate about this game. One thing they could improve are the graphics. Rating: 9.5 Amazing
tylernours;-;Game is awesome for animations and fun multiplayer. I enjoyed this game and I do recommend this game.

-[t]ArjlA;-;Amazing game to play/muck around with your friends. Tones of gamemodes, unlimited things to do, and just great fun!
EthanoL;-;Awsome game lots of gamemodes
Fysus;-;This is the best game that you ever encounter and you will be forced to soak hours and hours into it becuse its so much to do and alot of things to try!
HippoFingers;-;i've played 426 hours of this and i don't even remember a seconds, 17/11 don't buy
Massivive;-;Well, time to try out this new review system; Garry's mod is pretty much the ultimate sandbox game, it is supported by the majority of the Steam community (which people who have been here a while will know is the best community) and has hundreds of hours worth of gameplay added by players every day, the array of gametypes (also made by the community) can give you gameplay ranging from watching YouTube with your friends, to a multiplayer version of popular Unity game; Slender. Though, as the title of the game suggests, this started off as a mod for the Source engine, and though it no longer requires all the original Half-Life 2 content, many gametypes will use content from Source games Team Fortress 2, CounterStrike: Source and Half-Life 2: Episodes 1 and 2, though the fact that you may need to buy more than one title to fully enjoy this one may shy you away from playing, you must keep in mind that these are Valve games, and so will most likely deliver many hours of quality gameplay! (especially CounterStrike!) The diversity of the gameplay, from construction to recreation to destruction, provides at least one thing everyone will enjoy, and if you see a gap, something you find the game missing, learn LUA and get to the Steam Workshop!
comfox143;-;Best game in the world.
Comrade Dog The Ruskie;-;NO WAY TO EXPLAIN IT IT IS JUST IT
Maelstromo;-;Now you can live your dark fantasies of playing god, With the bone modifier! Warning:We are not responsible for your Creation going Rogue
Carl The Lamma;-;Awesome, i realy recomend this game to anyone who likes either minecraft or fps, this is a game for everyone
Nz_snow_z;-;The ultimate sandbox. Nuff' said.
Undead Kitty*Kinguin;-;The game basically no limitations. So that we can open the play.And many of the mod also brought more joy.And your little friends to play a game!!!
TheDancingGman;-;Really fun game.
Faria;-;Wanna die by toilets ? Buy this game 100000/10
Thrakesh, Dark Lord Of Randomers;-;Good game, I like the fact that there are no definate goals to reach which gives the game a rather rugged and free feel to it, along with this the fact that the game can be modded to great extent makes it a great choice.
Patfast;-;Bought it just for TTT. No ragrets. No egrets, either.
Cpt. Beatty;-;As someone who has played a TON of this game, I thought I'd write a simple review on it. First things first, If you have fun friends, this game will never ever get boring. That being said: PLAY THIS WITH FRIENDS. There is an endless amount of content on the workshop which makes this game entertaining, not even counting the immense amount of multiplayer game modes. Even without friends, multiplayer can be somewhat entertaining. Next, I'd like to point out that if you get this game you are going to definitely need counter strike source. The next priorities would be half life episode 1 and episode 2; thought those 2 are not required. The last thing I'd like to touch is addons. They can be fun, but they can ruin your experience. If you have a terrible computer and get 300 addons, you will have low hard drive space, and probably 10+minutes loading your game every time. That being said, don't just download EVERYTHING YOU WANT. Think, will you ACTUALLY use it a lot? All in all, you will not get bored of Garry's Mod. There is simply to much to do.
ToasterBoy;-;BALLS TO THE WALLS ING YEARS OF FUN
F1R3.Kael That Sunstrikes;-;This game is amazing for everyone. The is due to the fact that you can get almost any gamemode you want on GMod. The amount of devs out there makes this game amazing as well. New workshop content everyday, and new gamemodes everyday. The community is just generally amazing on this game. The game has many bugs. But these bugs affect some people, not all. They are normally visual bugs or crashes. These can usually be sorted though and if there is a game changing/limiting bug, Facepunch fix it quick enough for you to get playing; or you can probably find one of the many possible solutions online. The graphics on this game are decent, and, for obvious reasons, Half-Life fans will love them. They are modern graphics, but not as up-to-date as a game like GTA V. But, this is to be expected from a now, older game. In conclusion, this game is decent for the price. The major downfall is the probability of a bug limiting your experience, but this is not very likely. I would recommend getting this game if you are looking for Half-Life, online, with other ways of playing.
J McCoy;-;I guess it's a good game. I spent a few hours playing it.
Mr.Friendly;-;so yeah this game is amazing for just about anything you want to do with a huge community, although alot of the population are people lacking a few chromosomes you find some realy nice and cool people to play with and i personally love building in this game, as of this review i have put 4k hrs into it and there are people who have put in much more than that, most of these people have just the right amount of chromosomes
OBAMINATI;-;really really good game i seriously recommend it but be forewarned it requires a lot of learning.
spence;-;This game goes on sale for $2.50 every month and a half or so. Just buy it, do yourself a favor.
(zaka888);-;80% of my hours is loading screens 10/10
Arlen;-;Very good game. A game that will never get old since there's always new sh.it to download and f.uck around with. Easiest to grief, though, all people have to do to p.iss you off is throw your stuff around, delete your stuff, etc. Still, 10/10 game. (Takes about 2 years to launch tho)
Dr.RubricArc;-;You will not regret your decision of the purchase. 10/10 :3
Tipster;-;Very fun game to play with friends and even random strangers
ghostbro;-;I love Garrys Mod
Haedox;-;THE TRUMPETS OF GARRY'S  CHEEKS INTENSIFY!
Not Bob;-;It's a game.
[HTS] Sk1LLZz x K1LLz;-;I love this game, it has endless possiblities! It is deffinatly worth it.
Totally Batman;-;You can do what you "Can't" do in real life! Multiplayer is fun too... (idk) I just like making things ok?
Medeiros (   );-;What happens when you mix tons of games in one and give it drugs? Yeap. Garry's Mod.
Sound#InVacation;-;I like it so much!! But i've got a problem..With my noobyness i dont know how to save a game :|
irkeninvaderaj1234;-;Garry's mod is one of my personal favorite sandbox's and so far i love it, you can make films, play game modes for example prop hunt and death run, mess around with any models and best of all screenshots, only down side is that you need content like Team Fortress 2 or Left 4 Dead 2 or portal or half life 2 And counter strike source or every valve game, so if you have $10.00 don't spend it on Jimmy john's spend it on this game instead and pay for lunch later or just sell your copy of Teenage mutant ninja turtles: out of the shadows lolz OVERALL SCORE: 10/10 Exelent
The Herter Man;-;I love this game, I honestly have no life. Look at how many hours I have of it...IT HAS NOT EVEN BEEN A YEAR
Fabster;-;Holy , I've been playing Gmod since the god damn beginning of time. A piece of software that isn't even defined as just a "game" It's an infinite amount of experiences that change every time I start it up. With a stupid amount of content flowing into it all the time I doubt you will ever have the time to even get through all of it. 10/10 - would make gman dance again.
Transgamer;-;I can go to Hyrule castle and kill Stormtroopers by flying the Tardis into them. GOTY.
Ewan (  );-;Fun game - after 3 years it's boring though! GET IT ON SALE ONLY!
White Boi;-;haven't played much so i don't really have much to say about the game, looks promising
Secret Door;-;Garry's mode is iy fun and funny game
Maximus;-;TTT the best!
(  );-;Garry's Mod is that kind of game that can make you laugh out loud at the wonderfully insane things people have made, and what you yourself can create. Many gamemodes to choose from (albeit most requiring Half-Life and Counter-Strike for models and things to work right) and lots of fun to be had. I highly recommend it.
Haseo;-;This game really fun , you guys should try it >_<
Hi. I'm Jeff;-;I like this game, mostly the PROP HUNT mode!
coupe da color of mayonnaise;-;Like building games? Get Garry's Mod. Like Roleplaying games? Get Garry's Mod. Like Zombie survival games? Get Garry's Mod. Like First-person shooters? Get Garry's Mod. Like Racing games? Get Garry's Mod. Like massive NPC wars? Get Garry's Mod. Like murder mysteries? Get Garry's Mod. Like obstacle courses? Get Garry's Mod. Like hide and seek? Get Garry's Mod. Like hillarious physics? Get Garry's Mod. Like video games? Get Garry's Mod.
Tripsa;-;What other game lets you bash Mario's head in with a crowbar while dressed up as Elsa from Frozen while running away from a shotgun wielding Homer who wants his donuts back.
Flagg;-;I've spent over a month trying to fit a wooden chair into a soda can. 10/10
SundayCoolJames;-;Like, animations, weapons, horror maps, multiplayer support and much more? Well this game is for you! I like this game because, you can do, whatever you want to do. Cars, Gamemodes, Tools, Planes, TF2, FNAF... I don't know what to have in the future!
Dumbzilla;-;Joined darkRP, got propkilled or rdmed. Joined Sandbox, got propkilled or killed. Joined TTT, got rdmed for being suspicious. Joined flood wars, boat got rekt and a massive paywall to upgrade weapons. Joined stranded survival, a paywall to get upgrades. Joined deathrun, !premium and paywalls around each corner. 10/10 would hate squeekers again.
AreZiX;-;A game where you can do pretty much anything.
Coconut;-;This has to be the greatest game of all time. I love this game, there are so many things to do just by yourself messing around, or playing online on a server, wether it be Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, or any of the extensive gamemodes online play has to offer. Endless hours tick by and all you are doing is having fun wether it be painting some guy pink or attaching boosters to a car and send it flying into the sky. Even if you get bored of Gmod and decide to download TF2, you can mess around with all of the stuff in that video game right in gmod. Though it kinda sucks you have to buy and mount Counter Strike: Source to see the textures of most of the online maps.
Uberherbert;-;With over an astonishing 2,500 hours on this game I have to say I simply HAVE to reccomend this and I can't see why anyone would not reccomend this. I've seen this game grow up, from Garry's Mod 9 to Garry's Mod 13. That is like about 7 or 8 years now I've had the game. From Alpha to Beta to the finished yet slightly flawed product. Ok all that may not be true however you WILL LOVE THIS GAME GET IT NOAWWW NOAWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Anthony [Be];-;Do you recommend this game? aBSOLUTELY ING YES
Ipsimus Rex;-;Hours of creativity and fun. All Steam users should have it. The possibilities are literally endless.

There are many different game modes and so much stuff to do ! It's an endless game with really big potential, there are many add-ons, custom files and etc. Garry's mod is one of the best games/mods ever made :) !

Thaumiel;-;The most fun ive had in years. For as little as 2.99 (On sale) You can do these in Multiplayer. - Roleplay, Play FPS, Sandbox, Horror lots and lots more. There are entire comunitys out there and they thrive! I wouldn't of rather of spent 1236.4 Hours anywhere else. (Probably should of spent them on college, But Ahh well.) 10/10 Would waste college life again.
Eightcoffee;-;It's a fully moddable sandbox game. Nothing to say about it, if you're at least 1% creative and have friends you can have a lot of fun in this game. Could be a bit more stabile though concerning addon initializing.
Major Chompers;-;there are watermelons
Fahiko;-;makes u look like a big noob anywhere else on steam, if you have 2.5k hours on it

f1nchw0w;-;This game cannot be reviewed, yet it can as I am doing so. This game is the best, this game is the worst. It is the simplest of games, it is the most confusing of games. It is the most fun game, it is the most boring game. (What I'm trying to say is that YOU decide whether or not you like this game. It's all a matter of personal opinion.) What's that you say? You want to know what I think of it personally? Well, I find it a fun game in which you can express youself through multiple ways. Whether it's back-stabbing as a T in TTT or starting a rebellion in Jail-Break. *IMPORTANT* BUY THIS GAME WITH COUNTER STRIKE SOURCE BECAUSE YOU NEED TEXTURES FROM COUNTER STRIKE SOURCE TO PLAY TTT AND JAIL-BREAK AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER FUN GAME!
PeachDruid;-;One does not simply describe Garry's mod
Cpt. Hazama@Away for a while;-;Play it. The best game in ra world. You play content from other games and make stuff
Lem0nade;-;I don't know what to say about this game, so here is a recipe for pancakes, Ingredients: 4tbsp plain flour (about 100g) 1 large free range egg  pint semi-skimmed milk + water (about 300ml -  milk  water) Pinch of salt Butter for frying How to make pancakes: Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture. Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix. In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter. Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps. Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth! Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt. Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later. Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over). Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!
CupcakeKiller;-;This game is a lot of fun. I've met great people on this game in multiplayer. You can basically do anything your little heart desires with this game. As IGN would say, 8/8 m8
Lucifer;-;Gmod is Pretty Much Excellence in it's purist form.
'You sloppy son of a bitch.;-;10/10 you must buy this game
Squishy Lemur;-;Like a graphics enhanced minecraft physics games with machinery and guns, as well as building and the coolest steam community that you can think of.
Red Hood;-;After Playing Half-life 1 and 2 as a child i forgot most of the guns,characters and other things. Garry's Mod reminded me and then added some crazy stuff Its not even a game its what ever you want it to be 10/10 was also killed by a moving soda can
Chilledwolf;-;Let me explain what my life is like now that i have been playing this for a year. every morning i wake up, install some new mods, spawn in a nuke and a bunch of npcs, get a gun, shoot everything, use the  swep on people, and then flip everyone off with the help of the finger poser. then, i start playing garry's mod. i do pretty much the same stuff, but the people rage and scream less in-game. this game has helped me get back on a normal routine, as i used to do weird things like do work and talk to my family. 11/10 do recommend.

Sadninja6;-;fun thts all
Shawn386;-;Its pretty good I guess.
Zeream;-;Was fun back in 2007. Community was pretty bad then. Now its absolutely entirely garbage. This is nothing you haven't played or seen before. Avoid. There are better custom creation games out there these days.

zacy5000;-;Very fun. A must have.
GeassUser;-;This Game Is Awesome ,However Its Missing Some Key Elements Such As Drivable Chickens.
Cap'n Happy;-;I like the game a lot I only played a little and I feel like there's a lot of stuff I haven't found yet but my first few hours of the game were very fun and I might play it some more in the future. Just kidding I got the game two years ago and it has become my very favorite game just because of its sheer vesitility and options. I highly recomend it to anyone with a good sense of humor and a love for physics like I do.
Anus;-;Explaining Garry's mod is not so Easy but i try it. It was originally a mod for Half life 2 where you can choose maps play on it and your only tool was the the tool gun to create rope's. So basically you can do everything you want: Sandbox, Deathmatch, Zombie Survival, Minigames, Surf or whatever. Just look for the right server or download the addons and start your own server (your friends also have to download the same Addons) you can build Crazy stuff, try funny things and can learn allot about how the Source engine works. Basically = Source-engine in a nutshell
....;-;Do I really need to say anything?
Blze;-;Garry's Mod is a truly incredible game. I've spent hours just messing around in sandbox, playing trouble in terrorist town, prop hunt, murder, and more. Its really astounding what I can do in this game, and what I can furthermore do due to the amazing community in the Steam Workshop
Karma;-;Extremely Addictive. Gmod allows the player to experience so many fun and unique experiences. The fun is limitless  you can add more and more to the game and experience so many game modes to play with friends. I recommend this game to absolutely anyone. Whether you like scary games or adventure or just messing around or playing pranks on friends, this is the game for you. I admit, it was a bit tricky to get the hang of at first, but I think it was the most entertaining game I've played.
Mrdunx;-;Cool
Thaumiel;-;The most fun ive had in years. For as little as 2.99 (On sale) You can do these in Multiplayer. - Roleplay, Play FPS, Sandbox, Horror lots and lots more. There are entire comunitys out there and they thrive! I wouldn't of rather of spent 1236.4 Hours anywhere else. (Probably should of spent them on college, But Ahh well.) 10/10 Would waste college life again.
Sinon Asada;-;Killed a server admin. Got banned for 666hrs. 69/69
Not Bob;-;It's a game.
Secret Door;-;Garry's mode is iy fun and funny game
Maximus;-;TTT the best!
Coconut;-;This has to be the greatest game of all time. I love this game, there are so many things to do just by yourself messing around, or playing online on a server, wether it be Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, or any of the extensive gamemodes online play has to offer. Endless hours tick by and all you are doing is having fun wether it be painting some guy pink or attaching boosters to a car and send it flying into the sky. Even if you get bored of Gmod and decide to download TF2, you can mess around with all of the stuff in that video game right in gmod. Though it kinda sucks you have to buy and mount Counter Strike: Source to see the textures of most of the online maps.
Medeiros (   );-;What happens when you mix tons of games in one and give it drugs? Yeap. Garry's Mod.
Totally Batman;-;You can do what you "Can't" do in real life! Multiplayer is fun too... (idk) I just like making things ok?

I really like Prop Hunt cuz when i'm a prop,i'm a banana and i'm screaming like a llama on diarrea with someone in my back with a crowbar trying to kill me.That stuff with screaming are Taunts btw. I was trying to make a  joke,but it won't happen again,i'm sorry. Enough content for days,moths even years if you are creative.
shoobi;-;how does one garry the mod?
OhioBeerCans;-;One of the best games ecery
RileyGhostJ;-;I really love this game. It's pretty much a sandbox you can do anything you please. There's PVP, PVE, mixtures of both, puzzle type gamemodes, roleplaying game modes, and overall many fun things to do. ALOT of replay value. The problem with the game however is the amount of admin abuse. No matter what mode you goto there will be some dipsh!t throwing you around with their magical admin gun. You can follow all their rules, rules that they themselves hypocritically break. Some of the time these admins are a relief from the childish griefers. Most the time the admins make problems out of nothing. I notice that most abuse from admins comes from DarkRP and other RP modes. What can you do about the admins? Ban them? LOL? Kick them? Nope. Nothing you can do against them, all you CAN do is move onto another server. I notice there's some cool admins who try to teach you the rules but there's always that one d0uchebag who has to perma ban you for doing something they don't like (even if it's not against the rules....). And of course all my favorites server with good fair admins die out. The community is full of morons, imbeciles, squekers, and those scrubs who have to RDM on every server. But other than the community this game is a gem. Very cheap too, if you catch it on sale it will be as low as $2.50. The one thing to note however is that you need a HF2 game (I use NMRIH but I believe TF2 works too. Anyways TF2 is probably better because some servers uses models/textures from it.) and many servers require CS:S. I don't own CS:S but I found a texture pack from youtube and that makes 0 errors visible. (I got it from here if you're interested.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UR3-2zO4IM) In a nutshell : Community 3/10 Story : N/A Gameplay : 10/10 Replay value : 9/10 Fun : 8/10 Overall : 9/10

Happeleh @ yu do dis;-;Joined Cinema server got kicked out right away joined second time got kicked again but different server tried third time got kicked joined Sandbox wasn't kicked so i can rate it 11/10 why not 12? Because Cinema is bad they kick u!!!

Binimites;-;This game, Oh this game. You will have a giant imagination when you play this, there is so many game modes but most require a download and textures from source games, but they will be worth it, to see how awesome and creative this game is.

DEG | That Guy Sensei;-;Amazing Sandbox game and some multiplayer servers are really fun i recomend it!
Kryptic;-;The Game where you get shot in the head by a melon with a nuclear warhead launcher then  by batman... 50/10 Would buy again
Geomire;-;This game does not have a goal unless you want it to. It really doesn't matter what you do unless you have run out of creativity completly :). Garry's Mod allows you to build, shoot, drive and simulate essentially anything you want. Community add-ons make infinite variabilities and there are several servers with different modes. Highly recommended.
vatha the Khudriag-Ata;-;Recommended to have atleast 20 gb for this game, cause it's eating memory like a ing monster.
The Black Nigga Tyrone;-;You cant really say anything about this game, because the game is the top of all games...
Paul Walker;-;My first experience in a gmod server (TTT) Join a TTT server Dont know jack  on how to play Traitor dies Get a Jihad See group of innocents Around 6-7 all hanging out together Go to them Pull out jihad Go boom boom Get slayed for 6 rounds Leave the second time I got slayed still dont know what the server it Would suggest/10.

Dragonlord3344;-;What can i say, epic game.

Mister John;-;im gonna say 5 good things about gmod 1. 100 of gamemodes 2. you can make amazing pictures 3. good for animating 4. fun for hours 5. buy it
Orion;-;My GMod Story: It started out when I joined a small freebuild server. No new things, just old nice addons--nothing special. I built myself a small cottage which looked more like a hobo's den. I went to my neighbors house. He was making a fancy old graveyard, with a small pumpkin guy behind it. I asked, "Hey! What are you making today?". He responded with a short grunt over the mic. I asked again, "Please do tell.". Another grunt. I soon gave up. I noticed a small gaurd holding a rifle. I asked my neighbor, "Who is that?". Another grunt. I was tired of it. So I went back to my house to improve. Chapter 2 Wow, I wonder how I did it. I had a full-nice-cottage. A admin walked up and asked; "Where ya' get them skills, mate!" I responded with, "Wasn't hard. I just studied his graveyard.". The admin walked over to the graveyard. "Well, well! Nice job. Mind ya' shinin' light on y'ur builds?". This time, he responded. "No, sir.". He showed him how to build a fancy house. I then settled into my cottage, and fell asleep. Chapter 3 I woke up... the next game. The fog was turned up, so I checked my settings. No fog, though... I went to the admin to ask; "What is with this fog?". He simply said "I don't know...". We found a small crowd near a kiosk. A melon kiosk. I looked around. My neighbor was their with the gaurd, buying some melons. C-R-R-A-A-A-C-C-K! A 9mm goes off. I ran to my house. Oh, dear. I heard more. And then a loud slump as the kiosk fell. A admin started banging, begging to be let in. I heard more crossbows and 9mms go off. It was all we could get our hands on! I grabbed my 9mm and slowly opened the door. The admin--and a player-- rushed in, blockading the door and windows. He yelled, "Upstairs, guys! Uistars or theu ger us!". His message was full of grammar mistakes--because of his worry. We blockaded the steps. Cre-e-ea-ak... a door opens. A loud SMASH! And then a groan. A player's head shoots upstairs. "Oh, no..." says the admin. He continues to barricade the stairwell, while me and the player are in my rather cramped attic. CRAAASH! My lamp falls. I hear the admin yelp in pain, then a large amount of banging. It stops, and I hear a blood-curdling scream... the head shoots up into the attic. I hear the creature break a window--then into... the attic. Me and the player here run! Another bang, as I hide behind furniture. The player hides behind a broken wood fence. I see a ape-like shape, with a bloody mouth and a stained fur coat. I then see the player across from me freeze, and fall to the ground. He is paralyzed--and I can't help him! The monster jumps down--boy, oh boy, I got a good view on em'. He graps the player, rips off his head, and pulls out his spine. The creature then proceeds to knaw on the spine--then throws the head off into the fog. I then also see him creep up behind another player moving inside, who is armed with a 9mm and a lantern. I run out the window-and also catch a glimpse of his mighty pounce... I hear another scream as he rips out his spine to chew on. Then, I run to the broken melon stand, only to see the last of the players leaving the server threw the underground subway--a in-game addon that allows travel threw servers... I missed it. I see the last station close. It's just me now. Chapter 4: Finale . I then realise I could have left. But when I try to--I can't. The creature is near. A sudden thump... as a evac server pops up--[FastDL]EvacCrashCourse[EVAC-FOR-CRASHES]. I quickly hop on--to never join that server again.
Toaster Master Race;-;Got killed by an explosive watermelon. 11/10
Doge;-;very fun sandbox game and sweet multiplayer server and game modes very fun with friends!
RedLineBoomBoom;-;This Game Is Amazing A Ton of Fun, Always Meet A New Friend! A Lot of Gamemodes, I Can Play This Till The Day I Died! 9/10 You Must Buy This!
Billy;-;Remember that one time when i steped on your aunts toe and your dog was all"bark bark motha a" then a penguin jumped through the window and ate all your french onion dip? no? well, that happened here
Bluefire.;-;Meh, the fun lasts for a little bit, so I didn't play for very long.
Wolf;-;What is Gmod? Gmod is a game where anything is possible,You can build whatever you please you can either have a server where players can do what they feel free to or if your into RP darkrp is a great thing you make the rules and jobs might be hard but this game Lets anything happen
Dinopet;-;This game is great! Not only is it a sand box that had infinitly many possibalities it also had many gamemodes that are just as fun or even more enjoyable! Some of these include Troubble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Gmod Murder, the list goes on!
.Arnar Mavrin;-;Its fun
Banner;-;Got mugged by a 5 year old Child. Then told to watch gay Russian porn On Garry's Mod Cinema. Then screamed At by a twelve year old on deathrun and bhop. Still haven't played the game that much, 9.8/5 approved by 12 Year Olds
glue residue;-;You can get different player characters, different weapons, and Trouble in Terrorist Town!
Hasukin;-;I have always liked simulation games, but Garry's Mod has always succeeded the limit of fun and enjoyment. Because the only limit is your imagination and you can do whatever you want, whenever you want and as much as you want. For me it's one of my favourite games to mess around and have fun with my friends, or make friends probably in different servers! But most of all I Gmod (Garry's Mod) always makes it fun for me and aswell my friends, as you socially increase your limit of imagination by sharing which makes Gmod one of the unique games of enjoyment with social sharing. ;) I recommend this game for anyone who would like simulation games or just to mess around. :)
[DD]Radiant Potato;-;It's K :3
_/| 1k ping gg of Cykaland;-;Still better than COD
PootisVionSty;-;its nice i give +rep nice game but one problem is game crash!!!!! pls do not game crash!! its than 10000 Stars from me !!! its than okay! Nice Game Guys download it!
DanWinchester;-;Very nice game!
KingLizard95;-;GMod is a very fun game with friends! Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, and a bunch of other Gamemodes for you and your friends to play together!! or play on servers with random people and play with them. Download some maps for additional experiences to the game. Granted that you need other Valve games on some maps and textures to fully experience this game. I fully recommended getting this game. Tons of fun to play, you wont regret getting this game!
EpicEthan;-;Garry's mod is just such an amazing game. It's like minecraft except you can build contraptions. There aren't any aims or goals the game just gives you the tools and leaves you to play. There are also weapons and you can also build stuff out of materials. I recomend getting this game if you haven't already and I will be playing this game for a long time to come.
[PowerGL]StR3NG;-;The game is very cool and everyone should try it and play it worth!
Angela Merkel's Shapely Curves;-;This was my first time playing. Joined a roleplaying server. I was a hobo. Gun dealer wouldn't give hobos guns. I Dropped a fridge on him.(Against Server rules). The revolution agaisnt the 'goverment' began. I gathered up almost three quarters of the server to join the fight. The good fight. I printed illicit money (Against server rules) for people to buy pistols and assault rifles with (Against server rules). We made a banner. Some of us swore.(Against Server rules). We stormed up to the police station demanding all sorts of stuff. Gay rights. Free money. Roofs over our heads. This was met with silence. AND WE MET THEIR SILENCE WITH GUNFIRE.(Against Server rules). Scores of police officers were dead but we all had been sent to prison. I pleaded to my captors, begging them for rights for hobos. About 3/4 of the server was in prison. We hatched a plan. A plan to kill the governor. (Against Server rules). We killed him. (Against Server rules). The server restarts. I become the governor. Perhaps the power got to my head or the events I had witnessed were too much to bear. I punched a guy. (Against Server rules). The admin finds me and threatens to ban me. I call his rules "Stupid". I am banned. So. The moral of the story is when you Role-Play on a garrys mod server feel free to start a revolt but don't punch a guy.
Solstice;-;Great game. Have sunk may hours into and plan to continue to do so.
[URPG] Jelly_JELL-O;-;Its A Fun Sandbox Game Thats Not That Expensive. I Say A Thumbs Up.
Doge;-;Only Game where you have about 10GB of addons in your addon folder.
BlazingVictini [On Vacation];-;This game is THE sandbox game to own. It has an overwhelming number of gamemodes, addons, mods, and just about anything you can think of. You want to play a TDM gamemode? Fine, that's here. You want to build a walking mech with random people? Go for it. You want to parkour around a good-sized city with a bunch of tag gamemodes? Yup, got that too. For $10, I can't really think of a reason not to buy it, or if the price is too steep for you, it frequently goes on sale for $2.49, which hopefully you can dish out by selling trading cards, or scrap on TF2. 10/10, would <EVERYTHING> again.

ThePotatoTurtle;-;Garry's Mod is fun 90/100
Spiky Spooderman (   );-;funny game with funny people :D
TeamContinent;-;If you're a newbie Steam user, you probably want to take in consideration to buy something like Counter-Strike:Source to get the most out of this game. It's like if you required other Java games in order to play Minecraft without errors.. Insanely fun game, without a doubt. If you want to have the most fun, though, play with friends. Please.
Xeyar;-;if you dont get this game then you will never live
OBAMINATI;-;really really good game i seriously recommend it but be forewarned it requires a lot of learning.
(zaka888);-;80% of my hours is loading screens 10/10
White Boi;-;haven't played much so i don't really have much to say about the game, looks promising
(  );-;Garry's Mod is that kind of game that can make you laugh out loud at the wonderfully insane things people have made, and what you yourself can create. Many gamemodes to choose from (albeit most requiring Half-Life and Counter-Strike for models and things to work right) and lots of fun to be had. I highly recommend it.
Dr.RubricArc;-;You will not regret your decision of the purchase. 10/10 :3
Patfast;-;Bought it just for TTT. No ragrets. No egrets, either.
Cpt. Beatty;-;As someone who has played a TON of this game, I thought I'd write a simple review on it. First things first, If you have fun friends, this game will never ever get boring. That being said: PLAY THIS WITH FRIENDS. There is an endless amount of content on the workshop which makes this game entertaining, not even counting the immense amount of multiplayer game modes. Even without friends, multiplayer can be somewhat entertaining. Next, I'd like to point out that if you get this game you are going to definitely need counter strike source. The next priorities would be half life episode 1 and episode 2; thought those 2 are not required. The last thing I'd like to touch is addons. They can be fun, but they can ruin your experience. If you have a terrible computer and get 300 addons, you will have low hard drive space, and probably 10+minutes loading your game every time. That being said, don't just download EVERYTHING YOU WANT. Think, will you ACTUALLY use it a lot? All in all, you will not get bored of Garry's Mod. There is simply to much to do.
ToasterBoy;-;BALLS TO THE WALLS ING YEARS OF FUN
F1R3.Kael That Sunstrikes;-;This game is amazing for everyone. The is due to the fact that you can get almost any gamemode you want on GMod. The amount of devs out there makes this game amazing as well. New workshop content everyday, and new gamemodes everyday. The community is just generally amazing on this game. The game has many bugs. But these bugs affect some people, not all. They are normally visual bugs or crashes. These can usually be sorted though and if there is a game changing/limiting bug, Facepunch fix it quick enough for you to get playing; or you can probably find one of the many possible solutions online. The graphics on this game are decent, and, for obvious reasons, Half-Life fans will love them. They are modern graphics, but not as up-to-date as a game like GTA V. But, this is to be expected from a now, older game. In conclusion, this game is decent for the price. The major downfall is the probability of a bug limiting your experience, but this is not very likely. I would recommend getting this game if you are looking for Half-Life, online, with other ways of playing.
DeadlyWhisper;-;Prop Hunt , HnS , Murder and TTT are fun to play with friends and solo ;D
ReachEi;-;ITS THE MOST FUNNY GAME AND YOU CAN DO ALMOST EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME SO I RECOMAND THIS GAME
HunerMate;-;Best Physics Game of all time !
Fridgey  #TerrosquidAndProud;-;I haven't played this very much, but it seems pretty OK so far.
Monnik;-;Step into the random sandbox game called "Garry's Mod", I had low expectations for this game, but certain gamemodes turned out to be tons of fun. Hide and seek playing objects, find out who among your friends is a traitor or go out and be a police officer or medic during a rollplaying game. The possiblities in this game, realy are limitless. 8/10
Pudmuffers;-;It is one of the best sandbox games ive ever seen.Compareing to minecraft i would pay twice as muhc for this.
[DFS]Bottle of 'Scrumbeh;-;Why play this game? Because you can ride a flying bath and fap at the same time 10/10 Would use anime player model again
No.9 //;-;This game is EVERYTHING!!!!
|RGC| ReEzy;-;Owned 7 servers. Wish I had more time to play
Captain Pootis  Bamf;-;Dis reeely great game where you can do all kinds a stuff and build things and kill npcs and hang babies from trees without actually doing it! Try it out. Is fun as heck. The community of Gmod has always done a lot; a bunch of tf2 addons start as parts for scenemaking in gmod and sfm, for example. This is really a great game I would definitely reccommend it to anyone with a creative spirit and a passion for building, PVP or the various other gamemodes out there, or even scenemaking and photography. I really love this game; if you check my profile you'll see I have about 2500 hours and counting invested here in gmod. It's a great mod and doesnt require much space; you should get it. It's awesome Thanks so much Garry, you can take a while on fixes here and there but that's definitely outweighed by gmod as a thing. Top 3 favorite game of mine.
sleezy;-;yea it good
chicken weeng;-;A very fun game with and without mods, easily one of the better sandbox games out there. There's a huge range of options for different people, from building enthusiasts to machinima makers. The experience gets better when mods are enabled, which adds even more variety. Multiplayer is also great, as you get to interact with fellow players and make friends. The price of the game isn't bad either, costing only $9.99, with prices as low as $2.49 during sales. However, there are some faults in the game, mainly LUA errors, but they're not too major. The selection of maps in the vanilla game is very bland as well. Gripes aside, I highly recommend Garry's Mod, it's worth every single cent.
Perrywinkle;-;Oh my ing god. Okay, oh my ING god. Let me in' drop the shit low-down on this, oh my ing  of a god. This game. Oh my Christing god. This game is literally, ing heroin. You get abso-ing-lutely addicted to this  like no ing other drug out there. There's so. Much. ing. . You. Can. Do. You can ing: Download mods that let you drive cars. You can drive cars from HL2. You can shoot HL2 guns. There's limitless possibilities. Holy . . God damn. I ing. Hold on. Okay. . Buy this if you're already addicted to heroin and can't make life any ier.
[SG]jclkiller;-;great and amazing
Nexxo;-;Garry's Mod is awesome. Whether you like building in a sandbox, mysteries in a TTT game, hiding and hunting in Prop Hunt and lot's more... Garry's Mod has something for you. 9/10

[Brony] Unadversary;-;This is the best game in the world :D
Baby Fridge;-;I have a boner.
NoN;-;I actually recommend this, but.. this was the best days when there is no fnaf fanboys. The game itself is awesome 10/10, this is the first game, that I actually liked to play on Steam. The best thing is, you can create anything that you want, the only limits is your imagination, there is no goal in the game, thats what I like about it, you create the goal by yourself. This game is like, every game that existed got thrown in the blender, and we get this masterpiece. This game is actually pieceful, if you dont kill everything like a f*cking idiot. There is so many gamemodes to choose from, my personal favorite if RP, it can get stupid with raids and mug drops, but it is still my favorite. This is the most fun game I ever played in my life. If you want to find a game that you can do anything in, I recommend this game.
swaggin_dragon5;-;odd gaem but that's what makes it good
Evan M.;-;I am having problems with this game it didn't start too long ago. I was able to restart my computer and start up Garry's Mod completely fine. This is the message that I received when I started the game. http://prntscr.com/6168ml
Lobstopus;-;Play this game and: Make your own space shuttle and crash it Make a rainbow Do the Harlem Shake Go swimming Eat cake Destroy your ears with increasingly overlayered music Electrocute yourself Seriously mess up gravity Fly right up in the sky Do the Moonwalk Fall off a cliff Blow up the world Break your computer And more!
blind sharpshooter;-;i you have a friend it is good fun to mess around
zcK;-;I really like this game !! Its funny and there are many games you can play :) !
Alfex;-;One of my favorite games still to this date. Met so many people in this game, Some good and some not so good. It's great fun if your bored or just looking to have some fun. Many game modes to choose from, Dark RP is one of my personal favorites alongside Trouble In Terriost Town. I personally think it is one of the best community driven games out there. But make sure you buy CSS alongside garrys mod as a lot of the game modes use the textures from CSS.
[DD]Radiant Potato;-;It's K :3
cara;-;i dont know how i even spent more than a minute on this god forsaken piece of  5/5
JiveDino;-;Best sandbox game out there
XXX_BlazeitBlunder_XXX;-;If you love doing whatever the hell you want in a game, Such as killing, Flying airplanes, Building epic contraptions, This is your game, With hundreds of maps and addons to choose from, It's never ending fun, It is totally worth the 10 dollars. You won't regret it :)
Gamebonnie [Rabbit];-;This game is one of the best games i've yet played.....it has a great multiplayer....and its fun to play with your friends I already put in a few hours just playing with my friends in a private server........ Good stuff about the game are: -Fun -about a million addons -no lag atleast i don't get lag -has multiplayer Bad stuff about the game are: -crashing I hope you think this review is helpful
ree (sfm);-;"DUS GIAME IS DU AWSSSEEOM3 SRYSLY BR0" -RandomForumsWebsite ^That was the short answer^ For people who already know about this game, read this: But really, this game is awesome. I play this game on a daily basis and I really enjoy it. With fun gamemodes and multiplayer, this game is unbeatable, no game can be better than this. The popular gamemodes like JailBreak and DarkRP, or even CW:HL2RP (If you're wild) are the ones I play, and personally recommend. For people who are about to get it or just getting started, read this: If you don't have this game, BUY IT NOW, it is awesome. But if you already have this game and just getting started, I recommend playing multiplayer and simple gamemodes like TTT or Prophunt, those are ones I started out with. Then when you are used to the controls and used to everything and want to start exploring, try maybe JailBreak (I recommend LifePunch JailBreak), or even CW:HL2RP (again, if you're wild). Keep playing and exploring new gamemodes and have fun. I know this is more of like a guide, but I tried my best. Thanks for reading, Karim
.;-;Good over-all game with lots of gamemodes, addons, and other fun things to do.
Kurama;-;One of the best games i have ever played
Pablo;-;The most fun I've ever had in a game.Everybody has to own this game!
_/| 1k ping gg of Cykaland;-;Still better than COD
TheCrackerland;-;This games community is cancer that youll keep coming back to, just like cigarettes. It stops being a game after a while. Garry's Mod will make you bitter, it will rot you from the inside out and transform you into a leech of other peoples joy. Other games dont appeal to you the way Garry's Mod does. This game will change you. Play at risk.
Reduq;-;ran around as a cooker playing darude sandstorm. 10/10 would taunt with darude sandstorm again

Get assassinated almost instantly whilst my newly converted Englishmen dance and praise my name. 10 Lancaster bombers out of 10 Panzerschrecks would genocide again.
.;-;quite nice for an old game ... its crazy ..totally addictive ..pervert stay bcoz chop here ...
Walrus Overlord;-;Possibly one of the best games you'll ever damn play for a price like this. Seriously, pick it up if you have a chance! The possibilities are endless. Watermelon cars, G-Man missiles, a war between head-hugging zombie aliens and nyan cats! (I'm not  you that last one is actually possible.) Crash your computer with nukes, kill friends, build bases, wage wars! Aside from the vanilla sandbox mode there's hundreds of thousands of addons free to download via. the Gmod workshop, easily accessible at any time for your gaming pleasure. Bored with sandbox? Get on one of the many popular gamemodes widely avaliable online. Murder- You and a handful of strangers or friends struggle to survive, as one of you is struggling to kill! Work together to live as somebody on the inside tries to kill everyone. But do not worry, one of the innocents has a gun. Trouble in Terrorist Town- Think Murder, except everybody has guns. And there's a role for everybody to play in finding who's who. Prop Hunt- One team of hunters, one team of Props. Hunters are blindfolded for a minute while the Props run amuck in the map, transforming themselves into objects into the enviroment in an attempt to not be found. A personal favorite! Half Life 2 Roleplay- A genuine roleplay experience in the realm of the Half Life universe. Play as a Citizen, Civil Protection, Vortigaunt, Rebel, and all else you can think of! (Depending on your choice server's rules.) My #1 favorite, and the source of over three hundred hours of my total Gmod playtime. Many other variants of this gamemode exist, like Fallout, Halo, Mass Effect, and many others, if you're patient enough to look. So please, grab a copy of this game as -soon- as you can, it's worth it, honestly!
yk;-;Play, play, play and do that everyday!
Kr TTABU;-;It's really fun, and you can play with friends and family. It's a great bonding experience, and you should play xD

Got Milk?|CSGOSWAG.COM;-;i joined the game and the first thing i did was play prop hunt, i became a floating bag of chips 10000/10 logic
Grits;-;This is an overall good game, but most things I screw with have missing textures due to things not downloading properly. Not sure if this is client-side, server-side, or game-side. Anyways, Garry's Mod is definetely a game you would want to purchase first-hand if you are a new Steam User since it is played by many people and is loads of fun. You can download mods and mess with them, or you can play on a server with multiple people while played one of the downloadable gamemodes available. I like the idea that people in the Steam community can finally put their creativity to the test and create something that would entertain thousands of people. Imagine the guy who created Murder and how successful he/she feels that they made something worth mentioning to people they know!
PixelPacker;-;I uterly love this game there is endless things to do! 10/10
Google Kevin;-;i have injoyed garrys mod but 1 thing i hate about it is the... ahem.."ERRORS"
D.o.t.s;-;A Worth While Game to Get, Very Fun and I Recommend This Game!
Purple To;-;Garry's Mod Is A Very Famous Game As Well As Humorous. It's Not The Best In Graphic's In Today's Games, But In My Opinion It Doesn't Matter. This Game Is Known For It's "Glitchy", Multiplayer Sandbox Fun. People Can Take This Game And Make Other Games Out Of It, Which Makes Garry's Mod Even More Entertaining. I Think That Garry's Mod Is One Of The Most Funniest, Fun, And Creative Multiplayer Game EVER!! Although It's Not As Fun To Me When I Play Publicly Instead Of With Friends (Privately).
Darkheart (Gone Camping);-;This is one of those games where if you like having fun, this game is for you. you can test a variety of weapons in maps which are all made by steam users and game makers, and all of this you can do with your friends; it is the ultimate game of freedom.
PH0U3YY0U3Y;-;Garry's mod is a game that you can be very creative and also has a lot I mean A LOT of mods on one website called: garry's mod.org. You can also make your own multiplayer server. a server I would recommend is Deathlegends Zombie Survival server.
Morgy Moo;-;Garry's Mod is a perfect example of a Sandbox Multiplayer. With tons of Gamemodes to choose from such as the famous Trouble In Terrorist Town and Prop Hunt Its a perfect Game to play with your buddies. You can buy Garry's Mod by itself but its a lot more fun and less glitchy with CS:S. It comes at an affordable price and I can spend hours upon hours playing Garry's Mod GamerScore24

Shinem;-;If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place. Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

pinkphanpy;-;Gmod is a very fun and freeplay type of game. Making servers and creating games is plenty fun and being able to do whatever you want really increases the fun on it. It has such an open variety of things you can create and play around with for nonstop entertainment. Which is very enjoyable. i love this game and I would reccomend it to anyone.
Terry Crews;-;Dont even know how to play the game, but just get it cuz yolo 11/10

Revenger;-;Omg yes! I love this game! Its soo fun and different. If you love coding this is the place for you! You can create gamemodes, awesome servers all sorts of stuff, it is really rediculas how many gamemodes there are on Gmod, I expect there is about 30?
BENA1337;-;Garry's Mod is a perfect relaxed game with lots of modes which makes the game Awesome. I like Dark RP which is a Role Playing mode. Other modes include Trouble In Terrorist Town, Murder and sandbox along with lots of others. Those are the modes I enjoy the most.
LynxMcPaws;-;I love playing this game. It always gives me something to do, and best of all I love messing around with mods. I mean this game is good for everything to making really good screenshots to making a war between zombies and humans. And you can play with your friends too and play on different multiplayer servers. And when I said the best part is mods, you can use lightsabers to nyan cat guns in the workshop. And you can get different map mods and everything, and practically without mods, this game would not be, the way it is today.
Dehzon;-;This is a really addicting game. Once you get in to the game, there is no returning.
[XP] LethalRiceball;-;This game has its bugs, however this game has some amazing game modes. I love getting my server full and having a great time prop hunting or doing some TTT. I have wasted to many days and hours playing and laughing with my friends.
BuRN Adrian;-;I mean, you can do EVERYTHING. Is that enough?
Cute Anime;-;i play this game with my friends and i whach you
ryan090400 (FFP Leader);-;I like Garry's Mod as a game I can play with my friends sometimes, and when none of my friends are there to play I can mess around with addons and wreck it by installing too many. I think Garry's Mod is a great game for people from 12 - 30s because even though it's just a game with literally no objective, it's that fun. I myself as a 13 year old think it's very funny and hilarious to mess around in. But of course all games do get to a point where they just aren't fun anymore. Just a warning for people who think this game is cool, it will get boring in about 3 years tops, keep playing this game every week, once a week if you want to get fun out of it and make it last. Garry's Mod is amazing overall, it's a game to keep and I hope Garry Newman can take a break from Rust sometime and check back in on his genius mod that became an fantastic standalone game. And the thing about wrecking the game with addons, yeah um... don't ever exceed 400 addons or you won't be very happy. If that does happen, go through ALL your addons in Garry's Mod and delete about 100. That should fix it. ~Ryan090400

Sticky Nips In The Pits;-;This game is great, but can be hard to master, like how to build a car, or how to make your own add ons. Really fun and the creativity is endless. :)
Imthinkinarby;-;Well if your up for endless fun in sandbox mode go for it! you can get mods from the workshop to make the fun never end, you can then go to multiplayer and play all kinds of things with friends and strangers, Thus forward i recommend Garry's Mod.
AnotherAmurican;-;I can not recommend this game enough. I bought the game for $10 not expecting much. Boy, I was blown away. Even without the addons, this game is extremely fun to mess around in. Hours of fun in the vanilla, default game. If you install some addons however, you will never stop playing this game. I have too many hours on this game, 99.9% of it just messing around in a random map or server. Get this game now. Do it.

BlackChaosHole;-;Nice sandbox game. If you have enough money, buy it.
Chubs;-;Well, obviously I enjoy this game by how many hours I have on it. But I will be honest about this review, the community for it varies and I see more 5-14 year olds then actually adults on this freaking game. I remember when I first got this game that it was the other way around, but that was before idiots like Pewds played this game. Also, stay away from DarkRP servers, they suck.
[Charkster];-;Garry's Mod is a great game. There are many things you can do with just random old junk. You can build an airplane that can fly into sky, You can build a car, that has a giant party house over it, you can make anything. If you are bored of limited tools or props, there are TONS of addons that can help your imagination spread.
The Guerilla;-;Like reddit with guns.
Sir Ham the Wizard;-;This is basically a necessity for anyone who has a steam account, its endless hours of entertainment Score: 7/10 - A good game
2Legit2Quit;-;Yes I recommend this game it has alot of gamemodes such as: Trouble in terrorist town, Stop it slender, Prop Hunt And my favourite DarkRP I would reccomend this game for creative players. It has Singleplayer where you can mess around with stuff and do ANYTHING you want and make gmod movies and multiplayer which you can play with friends :D

Flows Cringe Calls *fedoras*;-;Hey there! Do you enjoy playing multi player with some very strange people? Want to lose some brain cells? Want to hear fat neckbears chat about Atheism? Want to experience some of the worst life forms on steam? THEN THIS GAME SUITS YOU! Play amazing games like "5 Nights at Freddy's" ( a very badly done remake of said game) but with socially awkward 15 year olds, or chill out and listen to people become flustered over "Trouble in Terrorist Town". Better yet, play on servers that are entirely play-to-win! THATS RIGHT FOLKS; PLAY TO WIN! ONE SMALL DONATION OF $20 WILL GET YOU JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO WREAK HAVOC ON A SERVER USING OVERPOWERED WEAPONS! Regular players on the server may seem like they dislike you but really, they just envy you. Don't let them bully you off of your favorite DarkRp server; you paid good money to have overpowered weapons and jobs on that server so you let them dislike you and envy your money like the peasants they are. Whats that? The server and community are gone after you donated money? Fret not my adventurous friend, because there are millions of Garry's Mod server and communities that are basically the same thing.
ryan090400 (FFP Leader);-;I like Garry's Mod as a game I can play with my friends sometimes, and when none of my friends are there to play I can mess around with addons and wreck it by installing too many. I think Garry's Mod is a great game for people from 12 - 30s because even though it's just a game with literally no objective, it's that fun. I myself as a 13 year old think it's very funny and hilarious to mess around in. But of course all games do get to a point where they just aren't fun anymore. Just a warning for people who think this game is cool, it will get boring in about 3 years tops, keep playing this game every week, once a week if you want to get fun out of it and make it last. Garry's Mod is amazing overall, it's a game to keep and I hope Garry Newman can take a break from Rust sometime and check back in on his genius mod that became an fantastic standalone game. And the thing about wrecking the game with addons, yeah um... don't ever exceed 400 addons or you won't be very happy. If that does happen, go through ALL your addons in Garry's Mod and delete about 100. That should fix it. ~Ryan090400
jst.- Luigi;-;If I were you, I would get this game the moment I would see it. Why? Simply because you can do whatever the frick you WANT. ;D
Vault-Wizard;-;well you need lots of wam to run this game and lots of missing textures because of not enough wam of wam the textures up to get the game wamming.When its waming then its good to wam
BuRN Adrian;-;I mean, you can do EVERYTHING. Is that enough?
|45|Rajkon;-;Astonishing amount of addons, game modes (such as TTT, Prop Hunt, Murder, Cinema, Horror Story and much, much more), possibilities, ideas... You can basically do anything what comes to your mind.

Dehzon;-;This is a really addicting game. Once you get in to the game, there is no returning.

TeamContinent;-;If you're a newbie Steam user, you probably want to take in consideration to buy something like Counter-Strike:Source to get the most out of this game. It's like if you required other Java games in order to play Minecraft without errors.. Insanely fun game, without a doubt. If you want to have the most fun, though, play with friends. Please.

BlazingVictini [On Vacation];-;This game is THE sandbox game to own. It has an overwhelming number of gamemodes, addons, mods, and just about anything you can think of. You want to play a TDM gamemode? Fine, that's here. You want to build a walking mech with random people? Go for it. You want to parkour around a good-sized city with a bunch of tag gamemodes? Yup, got that too. For $10, I can't really think of a reason not to buy it, or if the price is too steep for you, it frequently goes on sale for $2.49, which hopefully you can dish out by selling trading cards, or scrap on TF2. 10/10, would <EVERYTHING> again.

TigerNopeDopeDolaNolan;-;Very fun! Garrys mo has many different maps, game modes, weopons, cars, and many other made by everyday gamers like you. There is a wide verity of great game modes with servers attatched to them for you to play with without having to pay anything to play on the servers. If you think you have the stuff to made something you should using workshop to post something great that can be added onto you single player experice. Garrys mod uses the source engine though that might be a little out date it allowes us to do many things that cant be done in other games. The gamemode that come with it, Sandbox allowes you to do about anything you want such as a rave party, a zombie apocalypse, and many others. Ive played this game mode since Gmod 9 (the first version open to public) and it has been great throughout all my experice.
[FNAF] Baby Toy Bonnie;-;its a great game, u can download ragdolls, props, and even other maps, when i first played it, i was like "how do i play this?" and then after a few days i figured out how to play this, i was like "oh wait now i know" its really easy to get the hang of it, u just need a bit of time, so if u dont have this game, i recommend buying it :D
Nickickick;-;This game is insanely fun. The possibilities are nearly endless, from riding a chimpanzee, to boarding an airship from Final Fantasy. The game only get's better with multiplayer and mods thrown in, and you'll find yourself dumping hours into this amazing game, just like me.
HybridSeizure-BigDickLogan;-;Pretty good game, I would say GO FOR IT! It's an amazing game.

Twin Skeletons;-;Prepare to never have a life ever again.
Gift Blades;-;I'd recommend Garry's Mod to anyone and everyone, regardless of which genres of games you like. Garry's Mod is unique and you can literally do anything. With the large number of gamemodes, I can assure you that you'll find one to cater to your tastes. It's addictive, fun, easy and everytime you play it's fresh and exciting because the community is so rich and unique. With all of the different types of characters you can meet and the different kinds of way to play the game, if you have under 200 hours, I bet you'll learn something new everytime you play. 10/10, would play again.
Hikumi;-;Be playing in the world of Half-Life 2? Yes. Be using whatever weapons you want? Yes. Be killing whatever and whoever you want? Yes. Be positioning everybody and everything however you want?

Archimeteor;-;To be honest this is one of the best games I have ever played. It has no story to it, and if I wanted to make a rocket I can make a rocket. A car? Yep. A ? Why the hell not. This is why I have spent over 1,613 hours over all, why would I waste my time on a game I don't like?
SoBlindWolf;-;This game, is really fun with many possibilities. Making this a very fun game, and also enjoyable for time to come!

Sir Ham the Wizard;-;This is basically a necessity for anyone who has a steam account, its endless hours of entertainment Score: 7/10 - A good game
Advanced Warrior MVP #KICK;-;This game is boring without mods. But if you have around 200 mods it is one of my favorite games.
Sgt. N. Snake [70th ID];-;Yes I recommend this game it has alot of gamemodes such as: Trouble in terrorist town, Stop it slender, Prop Hunt And my favourite DarkRP I would reccomend this game for creative players. It has Singleplayer where you can mess around with stuff and do ANYTHING you want and make gmod movies and multiplayer which you can play with friends :D
Ezey;-;An amazing mod that has endless possibilities you can play by yourself in a sandbox create or go online which is the best part about this mod is the player interaction alot of minges but other than that I think this mod is amazing. It's a mod not a game,you can't buy it and not have the game it manly is a mod of Half Life 2,Counter Strike Source,and Team Fortress 2 to have "The Experience".
Mugetsu;-;Amazing game 10/10 you dont need to purchase other games....gogle a bit.
josh9962;-;It's really fun
Martin;-;This is a sandbox game where you can make anything that comes to youre mind and this game has thousands of mods. Garrys mod offers tons of multiplayer servers with many awesome gamemodes to play and it never freaking gets boring. i give this game 10/10
crazy memester XD;-;Anything you want, this game can do. Yes, even porn.
The Guerilla;-;Like reddit with guns.
Green Tea;-;Made a giant  and killed the whole server with it, then later got banned for prop killing. 10/10
Ehsaan;-;Best game ever made, I'll be happy if some companies employers play this game and forget their  buggy games. Sandbox, TTT, Murder and other game modes in every genre you like. But, there are silly things like 11-years-old server admins those don't know anything about management, they insult and then ban everyone who is better than them, it's bad and boring. Here's a suggestion: If you want rating for this, I would recommend 13+. Don't let the children be administrator :D
Charlotte;-;Good game with many different game modes. Spent TOO much of my time on this game and somehow I don't regret it. I play the Trouble in Terrorist Town game mode mainly but I also enjoy prophunt. The communities on here are just amazing mostly, and it is fun to meet new people on the games you enjoy. This game is less serious and more fun so you can have fun and mess around with other people and have a laugh, rather than just play a competitive game and act serious all the time. I have played over 2000 hours on this game, yet I still feel I can do so much more with this game and for it's price, you really cannot go wrong. I would recommend this to anyone of any age :)
Wolfy;-;My gametime explains everything.
BanLorenzo;-;What is sleep O_O I've spent almost two thousands hours on this game. It's worth the price 10 times over.
The Smokin Fox;-;Great game, You can play single player with mods and bots OR you can go multiplayer and play with others from around the globe. Very creative gameplay, Great sandbox game I couldn't recommend it more!

Doomsday;-;This is fun when it works, but it tends to be very glitchy. I struggle to enjoy this just because it takes forever to get a sandbox game to work. I just want to mess around with my friends, but even if I DL their addons, it still doesn't work. On top of that, I never know what I downloaded/how much space is taken up on my computer. The game is fun, but needs fixing. Too bad nobody's gonna fix it cause it's already making a ton of money. Sorry for being a  but I dont get why I have to deal with this many problems.
PypeBomb;-;Garry's Mod is a fun game if you enjoy messing about with the source engine and playing around with models and building contraption. However, if you use GMOD to make artworks or comics, then using GMOD is an absolute nightmare. Often time, Facepunch Studio and/ or Steam would release some useless update that throws your setting off and make certain graphic enhancement modification not work. Third party graphic enhancement mod is essential because without addons like "LIFE", the graphic is very, very grey. Also, the post-processing tab is atrocious and the options most often make the already bad graphic much worse. For some reason, after an update, all my screenshots got a hideous yellow tint to them all. Also, it seems Gary himself is doing everything he can to sabotage the popularity of GMOD. As you can read above, the buggy nature of GMOD make producing good work consistently very difficult. Also, Facepunch studio, the main forum of Garry's Mod, is about as toxic of a community as you can get. In sum, if you are serious about using GMOD to make art, don't give Gary $10. Download SFM instead.
Zero;-;I remember when Gary made that first post that was the day Gmod died. He talked about a big change to Gmod and said he wanted to try to convince us that it's great so we should hear him out. It has now killed the game. Garry's mod has now been reduced to cloud mods that must be reviewed and published on a site and you cannot mod another mod due to copyright. There is no freedom, gmod is now a game "based on the game" because the only available content is some meme or valve material meant to be laughed at because "heh, that's cute." instead of actually doing great things. Garry's Mod is the game where you point at cute things and smile. It used to be the game where you do crazy . After the big switch, only 10% of all mods in existence stayed compatible and now a whopping 25% of the previous mods were remade for the new version. I lost ALL of my mods.
goktubora;-;I guess you need a few more base games(Counter Strike etc.) to have the most efficieny out of this game. I don't suggest if you don't have any friends playing it. It might be waste of money

Mr.Spiral;-;the only game where i can turn into Springtrap and kill something from hotline miami. xD this WAS great game until it stopped working.
Kiroza;-;Garry's Mod is just great.. Everyone should have it because it's just fun, there's so many different game modes and you can play whatever you like. Some of the most popular game modes are obviously DarkRP, Murder, Prop Hunt and there's so much more! So you should definitely get it ;)
Anime | Marrionette;-;I LOVE THIS GAME THIS IS THE BEST GAME!!!!! There is Single Player and also Multiplayer. Gamemodes are the best!!! Like Cinema and PropHunt, its the best! in PropHunt you are either a Prop or a Hunter. the Hunters have to try to find the Props, and Props have to hide for about 4 minutes! And in Cinema you can watch Youtube videos, Twitch videos, you get it , all most anything!
Jessie;-;got killed by a cut out cow 10/10
PortableJelly;-;This is the longest review I have written but no other game deservers it. Garrys Mod is probably the best game I have ever played. It has so many possibilities and things to do and you could even spend hours in the single player sandbox due to the awesome modding community this game has. Not only does it have an epic mod community it also has a great multiplayer community aside from all the squeekers, hackers and abusive mods. There are just so many gamemodes and mods that you could spend hundreds to thousands of hours in it. With thousands of mods and plenty new ones every day this game is hard to get bored of. I have also made many friends on servers such as TTT, Murder and DarkRP. It is also very fun to play private servers with friends and doing your own thing. All you need is hamachi which is free. This game is only 10 dollars but also requires CS: Source so get the bundle. You can do so many things in this such as roleplay a swat sniper, become a watermelon, have hovercar races and my favourite; get tellitubbies to fight a t-rex. Just get the game if you dont have it already. TLDR: Greatest game I have played that you can spend countless hours in and wont get bored. Just get it.

OG Loc;-;Makes me want to take a  in a bathtub.
B A S E D N E B U L A;-;Garry's mod is a good game, but there's a major drawback that almost make me regret the amount of hours I've put into it. I'll list this out in a pros/cons format PROS: -Good and friendly community ( at times ) -Lots of mods available on the workshop -Accessibility and support with mods is integrated into the game -Very easy to run (A laptop from 2005 could run this game at low and manage to get 30 frames) -Lots of variety in terms of game modes (Zombie survival, Trouble in terrorist town, Prop Hunt, etc...) -Open source, anyone can create mods/put them on the workshop CON: - The only con for this game (and many others) is the community. The community has an influx of a younger demographic as a result of their favorite youtuber(s) playing this game. The children in this game are fine sometimes, but usually they can be a nusiance/annoyance. This can be shown clearly in the comments on a popular/trending mod in the workshop. Although they can be an annoyance, it hardly hinders the fun of the game. CONCLUSION: Although Garry's mod has it's flaw(s), it's still a good game. If you can tolerate the community on this game, go ahead and buy it. If you're like me, however, and can't tolerate a large amount of younger players in video games, I would steer clear. Because of what I just previously said, i'm personally not reccomending the game for anyone who shares the same opinion as me. TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) Garry's mod is good if you can tolerate massive amounts of children. If not, stay away from this game.
Bat-flash;-;Don' know what to do ? Play garry's mode Don't know what to do in garry's mode ? Play in a serveur Don't know what to do in the serveur? Get kick 10/10
Agent Washington;-;Do you want to blow things up? Garry's Mod is for you! Do you want to construct things? Garry's Mod is for you! Do you want to brutally murder people and NPCs? Garry's Mod is for you! Do you want to play Murder, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, and Deathrun? Garry's Mod is for you! Do you want to waste your life sitting on your butt playing videogames? Garry's Mod is for you! Do you want to do anything? Garry's Mod is for you! 10/10 -Would waste life again

TheRobsterDJ;-;As a veteran of Garry's Mod on multiple other accounts, I must say that this game is outstanding for it's price, content and the hours of entertainment you can get from it. The never-ending variety of gamemodes within Garry's Mod leaves you to never run out of ideas, with many addons to offer from the workshop. I like this game because it mostly relies on the users' creativity, imagination and constructive mind. This game suits anyone's needs, whether you enjoy building, fighting, puzzles, roleplaying, adventures and many more! The gamemodes within this game, custom maps and more offer these genres of entertainment. I advise everyone to buy it, as there is no one that wouldn't be entertained by this game.
Doomsday;-;This is fun when it works, but it tends to be very glitchy. I struggle to enjoy this just because it takes forever to get a sandbox game to work.

PypeBomb;-;Garry's Mod is a fun game if you enjoy messing about with the source engine and playing around with models and building contraption. However, if you use GMOD to make artworks or comics, then using GMOD is an absolute nightmare. Often time, Facepunch Studio and/ or Steam would release some useless update that throws your setting off and make certain graphic enhancement modification not work. Third party graphic enhancement mod is essential because without addons like "LIFE", the graphic is very, very grey. Also, the post-processing tab is atrocious and the options most often make the already bad graphic much worse. For some reason, after an update, all my screenshots got a hideous yellow tint to them all. Also, it seems Gary himself is doing everything he can to sabotage the popularity of GMOD. As you can read above, the buggy nature of GMOD make producing good work consistently very difficult. Also, Facepunch studio, the main forum of Garry's Mod, is about as toxic of a community as you can get. In sum, if you are serious about using GMOD to make art, don't give Gary $10. Download SFM instead.
Charlotte;-;Good game with many different game modes. Spent TOO much of my time on this game and somehow I don't regret it. I play the Trouble in Terrorist Town game mode mainly but I also enjoy prophunt. The communities on here are just amazing mostly, and it is fun to meet new people on the games you enjoy. This game is less serious and more fun so you can have fun and mess around with other people and have a laugh, rather than just play a competitive game and act serious all the time. I have played over 2000 hours on this game, yet I still feel I can do so much more with this game and for it's price, you really cannot go wrong. I would recommend this to anyone of any age :)
Wolfy;-;My gametime explains everything.
BanLorenzo;-;What is sleep O_O I've spent almost two thousands hours on this game. It's worth the price 10 times over.
thedoctordalek1011;-;GArrys mod full of insanity and fun SOOOO cool to just mess around with if you r new to steam defitnitly get this game FIRST
[KG-A] Acbh;-;This game is super fun with friends its even more fun im gonna go easy on your brain ok BUY GMOD
Chubby Chaser (DDD);-;I'd give this game 5/5 stars only if you have all the games and models needed so you can actually see what you're doing without a bunch of error signs everywhere or invisible walls / ceilings / and floors.
Est;-;1) Join a server 2) Talk crap about it over voice 3) Break the rules 4) Get banned 5) Join another server 6) Go back to rule 2 10/10 would break again.
TheFrenchFry;-;Garry's Mod, also known as Gmod, is a fun game in single player and multiplayer, many different player made addons, maps, and tools to mess with by yourself, or hope on to one of the many multiplayer server running many different gamemodes. i say 9.5/10!
Klent;-;create everything
Leaks;-;One of the best "games" on Steam. This is a gem even the most uncreative mind can comprehend. What's that you want to strap rockets onto the back of a T-Rex model and try and send him to the moon? Oh what's that, you want to build a wooden maze with a maze generator, then put enemies in it and watch from above as they run around trying to destroy each other. Then once your done you can burn it all down, or push the undo and start over. This is a unique experience that no other game can give you.
DerpyDonkey;-;For $10, no matter what gun you have, no matter how much money you own, no matter how much gang influence you have, you can still have some 10 year old admin ban you for doing your job and killing him. 10/10
Kylellrc;-;heck yea build tanks whatever
DewDrop #PSFanBoy;-;Lotta s in this game, I'm one of them, be wary ye little eth.
Cry;-;One of th best games (mods) i have ever played!
Phsych0p4th;-;#1 rule in GMod: If you can do it in real life, you can do it in Garry's mod.
Foxy Grandpa;-;Played A GTA Online server met a man who had A fake name in the server named eric high as we jumped into the water my game crashed the last thing i heard him say was if i dont make it tell my mom i love her so if he did not make erics mom he loves you 10000000000/5 i miss eric
Green Tea;-;Made a giant  and killed the whole server with it, then later got banned for prop killing. 10/10
Ehsaan;-;Best game ever made, I'll be happy if some companies employers play this game and forget their  buggy games. Sandbox, TTT, Murder and other game modes in every genre you like. But, there are silly things like 11-years-old server admins those don't know anything about management, they insult and then ban everyone who is better than them, it's bad and boring. Here's a suggestion: If you want rating for this, I would recommend 13+. Don't let the children be administrator :D
Cringecity;-;...look, it's Garry's Mod. Do I need to really give a reason why you should buy this? Well, here's one: my playtime. That, and the ability to make whatever you'd like. With some technical know-how, you can easily make a shotgun that spews cookies all over people while screaming "Have some nice, crispy cookies." Things can get rather insane in Garry's Mod, just with enough patience. Afterwards, you and your friends are riding space bikes shooting nukes at each other in some ship at sea. While running from a red matter. Good times...
Jeff Chang;-;this game is like the coolest gayest  ever
[Kazoo]LionTakanashi;-;Great Game made a lot of good friend and its a fun game
Autism Speaks;-;9/11 would bomb
A Business Manager;-;It's a great game. No story, except the one you make(VERYCHEESYMUCHCHEESYLAME). 10/10 Except it says I'm still playing even after I quit. So now I may never play again if it doesn't go away.
billymays'doge;-;get this game. its AWESOME.
=T$E=came(theZmSlaya).ro;-;Ok...so this is my first complete review of an game. Don't get fooled by my hours in the game, because i want this game from the GMod 10. So, here we go. What is GMod are you asking? GMod is the best Sandbox game. Pretty graphichs, even if there are some textures bugs and errors, even missing textures. A great comunity. What a game would do without the comunity that get's more people into the game? Nothing. Well here is not the case, because GMod got the best comuntiy on Steam, this comunity keeping up the fun rate till' the next update with addons made with hard work. Multiplayer. This game have multiplayer. If you like to construct, fine, enter on one Sandbox server. You want to destroy? Sandbox with friends is the best oportunity to smash things. You don't like to create or destruct? No worries, you can have fun murduring people in ,,The Murder" You don't like that neither? Then go be a traitor in ,,Trouble in Terrorist Town", be The Slender in ,,STOP IT SLENDER" or be Santa in ,,SledgeBuild" or even be in an elevator simulator with ,,Elevator". The posibilities are countles, so the fun. Hope my review helped you to understand what GMod is all about.
snoodle;-;i don't even have this game lol
Fedor uh Choo;-;... Where'd my life go?...
Deadpool;-;me and kaz have a ton of fun playing this, definetely recommend this.
Axel;-;This game is addicting. The freedom to do anything is amazing.
James64bit;-;9/11 Would bomb those again.
justquant;-;You can build a space station out of nukes and "make a mistake" and spawn a blackhole, decimating the world instantaneously. 275891/2 GOTD In all seriousness though, if you are younger than 14, please do not buy this game. The community is poisoned by you little s enough. If you're looking for a game with a healthy community, this is not the game for you.
Lamb;-;i wasn't aware of just how many children were actually alowed online. until this game. it's deffinately a fun lil game to play., always enjoyable creating phalluc shaped structures as well tonnes of fun game modes to try out. just stay the f<3ck away from sandbox servers if you don't want your ears blown off by the sheer high decibel level that is...the squeekers. also. when in game. just hit up the character select straight the f<3ck away and get rid of your damn kleiner model.
Local riser delivers de pusi;-;all these hours i have are from the singleplayer playtime 10/10
T. "Likes 'Em Rough" Roosevelt;-;Garry's mod is...randomness in video game form! There is not one thing you CAN'T do in this game. Well, that is, if you're creative. If you are bored, drop the chips, come to the steam store, and get this game NOW!!! -5 stars :3
Lay Beside Me;-;MOC FAJNE!!!
DeFaulT;-;Probably the most fun I have ever had in a game! From killing robots to having a tea party this game has a ton of fun! Trouble in Terrorist Town to Zombies it just doesn't stop. I have alot of fun playing this with friends! I recommend this to anyone who just wants to have fun in a game or have a laugh. 9/10. Maybe be old but so much fun.
TigazZz*;-;You can be whoever you want in this game, you watch movies with your buddies, grow weed together, get randomly tased by a corrupt police officer. This and much more, its trolls paradise. 10/10. Gaben plays it.
[CC]Winter;-;amazing! gmod will keep you entertained for hours.
ZoopiGaming;-;This is a game within a game within a game...the ultimate game. Got bored of sandbox why not play TTT? Got bored of TTT why not play DarkRP? Got bored of DarkRP why not play Murder? Seriously this is a MUST BUY!!
[Daos]DURAS;-;BUY IT , PLAY IT , MAKE FRIENDS , KILL ANOTHER PLAYERS , TROLL THEM :3 u can do a lot of things
A Professional320;-;The best game I have ever played. It has endless possibilities and very fun.
BenGamez | On Summer Vacation;-;You can do anything in gmod. Anything and moreeee: Kill your friend with a taco! Have a 50 GB Addon folder! Play this game non-stop! Get banned by 10 year old admins! Have a gun that shoots nyan cats! Create a nuclear bomb! Cook drugs and sell them to the npc on the street! Listen to incredibly crappy mics! Browse the workshop, where you truly have UNLIMITED DLC HOLY CRAP Get killed by a T-Rex! Get shot into the air by a bathtub! Ride a flying GMan! Make a computer that is playing gmod, playing gmod, playing gmod. #GModCeption Play with your friends! Play the game dodgeball, where the ball literally kills the enemy! Play chess. Yeah. You heard me. Spend your life on this game! Tame a pet cat! Play a piano! Run from PedoBear! Shoot people! Spraypaint memes! Go to jail! THE FUTURE IS NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW thanks to science ~Clemoth Would I reccomend this game? Yes.
Dave Ravington;-;Great game to play with friends ... If u have any... Anyway, it has a great selection of game modes like: TTT, Prop Hunt, Melon Bomber... Plus it is really cheap :p
Brutus;-;so funny :,) million things you can do <3
RedWolfTheGamer;-;Garry's Mod... My Favorite Game Of All Time... I Have Played it For 1370 Hours... Still Not Bored... So Many Mods... Biggest Community Out There... 9999/10
randomassgamer flame lord;-;i love this game
Batmon;-;Best multiplayer game i have ever played!
FREDBEAR;-;This is an exciting game to play, almost everyone on Steam has Garry's Mod. There's no Storymode, or Missions, or anything like that. You are free to make or do whatever you please. What makes Garry's Mod so popular is the terrific people creating all sorts of things in the workshop. It is a MUST HAVE game to play 10/10
diezombiedie1;-;This game is awesome i recommend you get this game its fun but somtimes people cus thats the only thing i dont like
Levi;-;A very fun game
Jax;-;Love gmod almost 1000 hours
Luneville | Road2My Friends list;-;This is a great game but be aware that you will need to have css and csgo also so other games for the textures. So buy css before you buy gmod or buy them together and install both for the textures if you don't then you will have pink and black on you're screen which mwans missing textures. Don't look at my play time I have 700 hours on my brothers steam
Schmal;-;Imagine a world that's 15 years old and run by people who hate each other and don't remember George Bush. That's Garry's Mod.
Dope;-;lots of autists
TheTemsku_;-;Pretty funny game actually and Workshop makes it more funnier.
Fluffy;-;I killed myself with a toaster and watched my body fall down a waterfall. 10/10
caPiTal;-;Great game. I have been playing for awhile and I can guarantee it is an epic game. Sandbox plus Half Life physics equals awesome.
[IRAF] MR;-;This game is epic, you can build everything (well, if you have ability with this game). The most important things, are the addons, you can add more things to your game and be more funny, you can join servers of sandbox or gamemodes.
TobyIsACatAndHeIsFat;-;a game made for the question "what if you gave power to a bunch of sociopathic 15-year-olds?" all in all it's bretty gud, you can make stuff and stuff
Dreamvillematic;-;If you just go on mute, don't use your mic, turn off chat, never get on steam community, ignore players, then It's a great game.
IRoNiC beATz;-;Made a shrek church in 1942rp and had many followers. The fuhrer came in and visited me and made me preach everyone in the town about shrek and baptise him. someone came in with a panserfaust and blew everyone up. the ext elected fuhrer came in and everyone hated him so I made a gang and we got %75 of the server to join the gang. we all got guns and ran thorugh the streets killing everyoe we saw and heard people yelling "HOLY **** THERE ARE A HUNDRED PEOPLE RUNNING THROUGH THE STREETS WITH GUNS AND EXPLOSIVES!" we then ran into the reich and killed all the ss and police and marched right up to the fuhrers office and killed him. hen everyone left and did there own buisnesses and i was elected fuhrer. my old gang came in and said they were gonna take e hostage for money. they had guns so naturally I agreed. while we were sitting there I heard a clink clink sound then one of them siad "is that a grenade" and we all died. GG
Silent Bow;-;It's good. That's all you need to know.
AcE | TheSLAP;-;A very good game for mucking around with addons and Friends. The servers are amazing and is a highley reccomended game

[CL] Tomstah King O' Rebels;-;Epic and thats only the hours, gamemmodes, and mods I've used/played. Wanta know how Epic? Epic enough to get 100,000 good reccomendations and only 3,000 bad reccomendations. That's how EPIC! Awesome mods, awesome gamemodes, and awesome sandbox. 9/10
SUPER SANIC 2.0;-;Pretty good
blob fish;-;Real smexy
Squashuux;-;Great versatile and fun game, literally hundreds of things to do. I still enjoy this game after many years.
[CB] GloaBlade;-;This game is basically a do-whatever-you-want sandbox game ran on the awesome HL2 engine. There are tons of community-made addons for you to choose from, allowing you to do a whole lot of things. That's jsut sandbox, but there are even more gamemode like the famous Trouble and Terrorist Town and Gmod Tower. There are a lot of others too, and for $10, this is one heck of a deal! :D
Fullbliss;-;0/10 worst game, everything is errors and purple wtf.
REINO;-;i just .. do things
Asagi Boogers - RIP Satoru Iwata;-;Half Life 2 was one of my old favorites back in the day of the N64. But now that it's gone portable, and has been upgraded with minigames, more characters, and more, it's become my favorite platformer of all time. It's been perfect in every aspect of gaming, and it therefore deserves a 10. Story 8/10 Gordon gets invited to the castle for cake by Alyx in the intro scene, and he brings along Barry and Dr. Kliener. Father Grigori is there when they arrive, and they walk inside. After some time, Grigori notices they still haven't come out. He decides to go in and find out what's going on (this means you start playing as Grigori). He finds out Gordon, Barry, and Kliener have been imprisoned behind locked doors, and you eventually free all of them. After you free each one, you can play as that person, and take advantage of each of their special abilities to get all the Power Stars. After that, you must beat Dr. Breen and restore peace to the land once again. Graphics 10/10 The graphics have been upgraded since the days of the N64. The characters are less blocky now, most notably Dr. Breen. He looks awesome now. And the intro is too great to be expressed in words. The file select screen has 5 things apparently floating on water (3 files, options, and Return to Mode Select). Whenever you touch the screen, the point you touched emits a ripple in the water. If you drag your stylus (or whatever) across the screen, ripples emit from every point touched. I stare in amazement every time I do this, especially considering this is on a portable. Control 9/10 The controls in this game are great. You can do the whole mainstream game (not including minigames) with the buttons, except for loading and saving your game. The buttons are well laid out, but the running is a little awkward. You walk normally if you simply press a direction on the D-Pad, but you have to hold a button down to run. This isn't a big gripe until your thumb starts to get sore from the holding the button down. ut that's the only complaint I have. Sound 9/10 No complaints here. The sound are fitting, the music is appropriate, and the voices (which are mostly grunts and yells and such) are clear and loud. Some of the music is not particularly catchy, but that's the only thing that kept Sound from getting 10/10. Gameplay 10/10 I would have given it higher if I could have. If you've ever played the original Half Life 2, you'd know how sweet it was. Now think of it with a crapload of minigames (all of which are not only fun, but challenging), 30 more Stars to collect (bringing the total to 150), and the ability to play as 4 different characters, each with special abilities that are put to use in the levels and the castle. Gaming perfection? I think so. Replay Value 10/10 With 150 Stars, a bunch of minigames, 4 playable characters, and the addition of a wireless multiplayer mode, you'll be playing Garry's Mod for long after you beat it. Overall 10/10 This game was a huge leap up from the original Half Life 2, which was already sweet to begin with. If you have a DS, buy this game now. If you don't have a DS, buy one, if only just for this. If you can't afford a DS and/or this game, well that just sucks for you. Play a friend's if you have to. Then again, you might get hooked, so that may be a bad idea.
Rapist Pineapple;-;i joined my first game and got slaped by a admin 9999 times 11/10 would be slaped again
Oat Meal;-;You can make players heads funny. 10/10

King Charles;-;Ruined my life. 5 stars *****
[EVO] Darren;-;Hillarious game especially when you play with your friends. I certainly recomend CityRp and DarkRp for an even better game experience. Its great that there are thousands of mods that you can download and test.
waffleboy0122;-;the best source game ever but u must have counter strike source to see some of the guns like m16s deagles and more but u dont need halflife to see halflife weapons and models also if u like to build stuff this is the game for u

Headache Puppy;-;This game is very great and fun for the creative mind. You can made catapults and cars and machine thingys with thrusters, hoverballs, pulleys, and more. You can position ragdolls and make scenes. You can even get guns and kill people. And tons of add-ons it is impossible to get bored of this.
Thomas Bangalter;-;Very good game for posing gay porn pictures of your favourite characters. Also good for mindless massacre of NPCS, you dirty jew.
ThePantsWizard;-;Making beloved characters from Valve games do sexual positions was never this fun!
Oatz;-;Garry's Mod is a completely multiplayer version of every source game Wonderful piece of work! Start off with playing Trouble In Terrorist Town, and finish with some Deathrun! Garry's Mod is my personal favorite game! 9.5/10

Booty Poppa;-;its ok
JackieMoon;-;One of the best games on steam to date! 10/10
ZomDroiD;-;Best Game ever , my firs creation was  :D
ImNotARapper;-;i have a fear of watermelons 10/10 best horror game ever.
Kptn Howdy;-;This game, I just can't recommend it more. You can do anything you want, no, not like GTA, I mean, you're in a big sandbox and you can CREATE stuff from the right tools. You can also get some things from the workshop to help you create what you want. If you're bored with the SinglePlayer, well you got multiplayer and the hundreds of modes it contains! Trouble In Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Murder, and more. But beware, if you don't own Counter Strike: Source, the game doesn't give you the textures, so you'll be stuck with playing with purple textures and Errors. To conclude, this in itself is a FPS sandbox game. 10/10
Kptn Howdy;-;This game, I just can't recommend it more. You can do anything you want, no, not like GTA, I mean, you're in a big sandbox and you can CREATE stuff from the right tools. You can also get some things from the workshop to help you create what you want. If you're bored with the SinglePlayer, well you got multiplayer and the hundreds of modes it contains! Trouble In Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Murder, and more. But beware, if you don't own Counter Strike: Source, the game doesn't give you the textures, so you'll be stuck with playing with purple textures and Errors. To conclude, this in itself is a FPS sandbox game. 10/10
MonacledPotato;-;i had a friend named garry one time 10/10
Slothy J;-;A game of many games.
xh2p;-;One hell of an amazing game! The question i asked after playing for 10 hours.. "Hey... what can i NOT do???". Plenty of gamemodes and millions of ways to express your own damn style. Game for all :3 Don't believe me?? Check out Youtube...
I Am MonkApunch!;-;Do i really need to say anything?
Mantas`;-;Best sandbox game ever created! Create anything you can imagine.. Face posing, making maps, making machines, vehicles, transformations.. EVERYTHING! So what i can say, the BEST game ever.. you should try it.. its only 7.99E and its totally worth it! "It needs css" 10/10
Mario the Impaler;-;What can i say about this game? As good as funny. This game is a "must play before you die". Totally recommend it.
kodyd194;-;Garrys mod isn't just a game, or a set of modding tools, Garrys mod is an experience, whether your knowledgeable enough to make full use of the modding tools or you just want to join multiplayer and play some pre-made game modes, Garrys mod is definable worth your time. Be warned though that to a new comer single player, and using the modding tools can be complicated, but don't worry there are many custom game modes made by fans and modders alike hosted in multipayer, so there is always something for everyone.
[SZM] EssencePeasssencee;-;Garry's Mod The Good: Freedom to create anything you want: houses, cars, boats, planes, helicopters, or some other crazy contraption: from scratch or from common objects like crates, barrels, household furniture etc. Lots of different gamemodes: from sandbox to racing to City RP. 100% moddable. The Bad: Some contraptions need fine tweaking, physics can be a bit overactive. Summary: For a game that will only run you 5.99 (Or about 12 US dollars in the majority's case), Garry's Mod is one of the most popular Steam games, and the best sandbox game, ever to be created. The game recently scored 1.4 million copies sold, and trust me, I wouldn't think any game that's so cheap, money-wise, would sell that many. The main point of Garry's Mod is to build contraptions and make them work. These can range from cars to boats to trains to helicopters and a countless amount of things you can do. To build these you use props, simple models that were taken from existing games. Speaking of existing games, the other main idea is that you collect as many Valve games as you can so that you can use it's resources in the game. To start you off, you get quite a lot of stuff from Half Life 2, such as NPC's, weapons, models from the game and ragdolls. My personal favourite category is the HL2 Vehicles section, where you can spawn usually wrecked car bodies and try and bring them to life with the wheel tool and two thrusters on one side. Garry's Mod also has it's own range of pre-made models, such as jet planes, railways, trains, rollercoasters, and even has it's own mascot: G-Man. Sometimes building can be easy, other times it needs a little bit of perfecting. For example, to make sure a train doesn't go flying off a track you have to decrease the force of the thruster that makes it go forwards or backwards. If you're making a helicopter you might have to resort to using hoverballs, which can go ape if you're not careful. You would think that building a car is as simple as placing four wheels on a box and making sure the wheels turn the right way when you press a key on your numpad. Wrong. You have to add thrusters on both sides of the car if you want it to turn and not have too much force if you don't want it to drift. But it's fairly easy once you know how to do it. Besides Sandbox, there are also a plethora of other gamemodes. One or two of them have you live in a city, get a job, eat food etc. or it could be a simple deathmatch. Obviously I can't list every single gamemode that exists, so lets skip to the next part of this review. Graphics The graphics are amazing. The lighting is up to perfection and everything is just so detailed. The water deserves a real praise, it is absolutely beautiful. The player models are also perfectly detailed and everything is just perfect in general. Well done Garry, well done. Online The game was completely made to be multiplayer, but you can also go single-player if you want to. The community obviously varies depending on what gamemode you're playing. For example, sandbox players can be helpful and can make pretty cool stuff. DarkRP players can be a little out of order, otherwise they're generally ok. Overall, the online is A-OK. Audio The game has completely realistic audio. All of the props have their own material, so for example wooden crates obviously sound like wood when they collide with something, or when they get hit. Glass props will shatter like glass, metal clangs when it collides. If you die, you hear a heart-monitor sound that decreases to a long beep. If you get killed by an explosive, you hear a high-pitched sound as if your hearing got damaged. When you're underwater, the sound is modified to fit exactly that. Even the voices of other players are changed. NPC's get voices too, though all of the HL2 humans call you Gordon since they think you're Dr. Freeman. I love how the zombies sound like, especially the Fast Zombie and the Manhacks. The audio is again up to perfection. Controls The controls are really easy to handle. You can walk, run, sprint, crouch and jump. You can also fly around using the V key. This is called "noclip" and it makes you able to go through almost anything. Though strangely, bullets can still hit you so watch out. When you have a contraption going, such as a helicopter or car, you can control it like an RC toy with your numpad. Or you can hop in (if you added a seat) and can drive it. The handling of your own contraption depends on what you added and how you modified it. Other than that, everything is great. Repetition Being a game that can be expanded by the many Valve games out there, it obviously takes every resource from any Valve game you have in your Steam Library and allows you to use it to your taste. If you have Team Fortress 2, you can pose a Scout ragdoll in any way you want. Though some of Garry's Mod is original, such as having it's own models, otherwise it's a real resource user. Lasting Value With all the game-modes, maps, add-ons and various other stuff you can add to the game, this game shall never end up being defined with the word "old". Though sometimes you can end up not knowing what to build, but that's a different story entirely. It's guaranteed that you can play this game forever. Summary Garry's Mod is the best sandbox ever created, as I said earlier. Most of it's features are tuned up to perfection and the game never gets old. I'm still quite new to this game and already I've joined communities about certain servers on the game. It's definitely a great game in all it's might. Recommending it If you're a PC gamer, you have to at least try this game. Especially if you're on Steam. It's one of the most popular Steam games, and I would completely recommend it to every gamer I meet. I love this game so much. I can't see who wouldn't.
-TheFabulous-;-;Garry's Mod is fun game to play with friends Online. You can play in Local Network Area or join other server in Multiplayer. The game got alot of different modes. Sandbox, Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, etc. Sandbox is a mode you can release your imagination and create it and you can spawn NPCs to practice kill? Prop Hunt is a mode you hunt props. The people will hide as props and you guys have to find them and kill them. Trouble in Terrorist Town is a mode of Terrorists in 1 place. You either be Innocent and kill the Traitor, or be the Traitor and kill all of the Innocents. This game is really CHEAP and FUN to play with friends. Review from, I.AM.FABULOUS
Mr Gnome;-;Garry's mod is fun in many ways, whether you want to have fun with friends or just play solo. Many gamemodes, would recommend to anyone willing to have a fun time, but not wanting to get stuck playing for hours on end.
24Bowties;-;Amazing game so fun. One you probly should get dont u think if I am telling you!
Just Spiders;-;Must... get... addons... must... shoot... NPCs...
Judas Iscariot;-;its ok
The Welching;-;Don't play this unless you have at least an 8 mb/s connection. Vanilla servers don't exsist anymore. Every server forces you to download countless  models and more often than not it makes you download them via the workshop which doesn't give you an accurate progress bar. Have fun starring at a progress bar which just keeps cycling over and over again and leaves you blind as to when the item will actually be done downloading. For people who aren't privlleged with a fast connection, this game is merly a file downloading simulator and nothing more. I'm off to find a game I can actually play now. Keep in mind it never used to be this bad. At the moment however, people are to fond of loading their servers with pointless crap and making you download it from the workshop whilst connecting. I guess server owners have to have as much uneeded assets as possible in their servers or else their balls will fall off. Good game, just not accessable.
Samuel L Jackson;-;Recommened game
Lawyer Squid;-;It Ruined My Life.. 5 stars
Mitch;-;Garry's Mod Is very good game HAHAHAHA NOT
[DPG] Mankeybekfrumvaca;-;Garry's Mod Brings a variety of good quality and fun to your computer. It mixes all valve game like Portal, Half Life 1 - 2, Team Fortress 2, and finally Left 4 Dead. This is a great sandbox game, like minecraft that allows you to create anything that you can imagine. You can also create addons for the game, a gamemode for multiplayer, and much more! Different gamemodes such as TTT or Trouble in terrorist town for short, Prop hunt, Murder, and etc.! I truly believe that anyone that buys Garry's Mod will not regret any aspect of the purchase. Enjoy the game!
p a c y;-;Probably the best game in my library, together with tf2. Just amazing. One of the best sandbox games out there! You can use it for all kinds of stuffs, like minigames, building stuff and creating your own world of crazyness, i love it AMAZIIIIIIN'!
SwarmViper;-;You can do anything!
Blackmund McBlackr;-;This game, is all about your anal creativity! Theres so many mods, you'd think THAT TIMMY IS USING AN  CHEAT ENGINE, AND YOU CAN MAKE AAAAANNNNYYY THING YOU WANT, LIKE JESUS CHRIST GIVING HITLER AN ANAL HICKIE! THEN THERES THE MULTIPLAYER, WHERE YOU CAN DO STUFF LIKE MURDER PEOPLE WITH A CRUCIFIX AND THEN USE THEM FOR THE SLOPPY PUDDING DUNG AND THEN THROW IT INTO JOOK'S WINDOW AND SEE IF HE SELLS IT FOR STEAM TRADING CARDS, BUY IT, OR GARRY WILL SHIZZLE IN YOUR NIZZLE YOU STINKY TIZZLE BALIZZLE!

[Based God] Bryan Silva;-;If you enjoy sandbox games, this game is for you. This game has several online gamemodes with many wonderful communities and servers with wonderful staff from Dark Rp, to TTT, to Prophunt, to Jailbreak. Just buy the game you wont regret it. :D
Simba | Vilayer.com;-;I must say that this game opening up as an entire collection of gamemodes is honestly amazing, The millions they have made from this game were well deserved. If you haven't bought the game before you have no idea what you are missing out on. I myself recommend this game because of how open it is to the community. However if your a community man yourself and love welcoming servers... You might have some trouble finding one. The community can be a total sh*tbag sometimes. I myself have to deal with many people who only join servers to cause trouble. I don't have an issue with it but, It can sometimes ruin your game expirience. Every game community does have it's ups and downs and this game is just 1 in thousands of indie multiplayer games that have ups and downs. All together I give this game a 8/10 Trust me all you need is this game and CS:S (Couter Strike : Source) and your all set for lua to lag the crap out of you. :)
Alex;-;Got a few quid to spare and already have SourceGames? GET THIS GAME without a second thought! Countless hourse of my life has been spent on this game (but steam does a pretty good job of trying to keep record). A game like no other :)
Fernandez teh weffeff;-;Garry's Mod is and has to be the ultimate sandbox game using the Source Engine, it provides the player tons of different mods for whoever you are. Machine Guns and Assault Rifles for the soldier. Semi-Rigs and Racer Cars for the Need for Speed type. Building addons..... - ah  it, this game ruined my social life and that is why I give it an 11/10.
Bwakk;-;most addicting game ever
SkitZ;-;Garry's Mod is an incredible game with lots to do. Make a car, Make a story. Even make an entire game with it. Garry's mod is a game for everybody.

Over 1000 gamemodes, Including Trouble In Terrorist Town,DarkRP,Sandbox,Propkill,Deathmatch,Murder,Detective,Dressup,Factions,Empires, And much more. All for a great price of $9.99!
Abdul;-;Ugh, where do I begin? This is THE game to play, if you're going to even have steam, you must own Halo of the Cod magic crystal two. Yep, it's as good as it sounds. Intense Juan on Juan combat with very immersive gameplay, skyrim looks even better on the new steam machine created by sony. Do not let this game pass you by.
Bloodaxe;-;The game of possibilities! Alot of players online to game with, and a perfect LAN game if you're just looking for mindless fun.
- Shieldless Link -;-;This game is highly recommended by me and for one reason. The single player and multiplayer in this game is almost entirley made by other users. Users can make their own mods and submit them for other people to install them and use. Of course you have things from other games, shows, trending memes, basically anything. You can build and make your own custom bases/maps and ultimatley make the game within the game. A game where you can submit your own creations and use them in a game, makes this game all the more fun and worth buying. You can even make your own animations and movies from this as well.
Churm-E;-;The best! Get Counter Strike Source and a few good addons for HOURS of fun!
Lovecraftian Horror;-;A wretched hive of scum and villainy.

Headache Puppy;-;This game is very great and fun for the creative mind. You can made catapults and cars and machine thingys with thrusters, hoverballs, pulleys, and more. You can position ragdolls and make scenes. You can even get guns and kill people. And tons of add-ons it is impossible to get bored of this.
Thomas Bangalter;-;Very good game for posing gay porn pictures of your favourite characters. Also good for mindless massacre of NPCS, you dirty jew.
Oatz;-;Garry's Mod is a completely multiplayer version of every source game Wonderful piece of work! Start off with playing Trouble In Terrorist Town, and finish with some Deathrun! Garry's Mod is my personal favorite game! 9.5/10

Jeko-kun;-;There are multiple things for you to do in Garrys mod, you can build in playbox, download addons to make the game a bit more fun, download and play gamemodes with other people (TTT, deathrun, jailbreak, etc.). Highly recommended. Previous Edit: "AND PLAY WITH MEEEEEEEEEEEE"
Stranger_Danger_Dude16;-;Really-really good game. But it will be better if you buy with Counter Strike Source.
[TBC] MythicalZen;-;many uses in sandbox, love the game in general. open sandbox multiple playeble gamemodes and the addons oh man the addons, new addons everyday to pick from. pro's -massive/endless possibilities -many gamemodes [eg. DarkRP, TTT,Sandbox] -many workshop items -can run on almost every system [from windows vista and up] no's -long waiting times when booting up [100+ addons active] -long load times for singleplayer [100+ addons active] -broken/corrups addons [workshop] -PAYED MO- oh wait... they removed that :D on avarage on my entire gametime i had a load of fun. i would rate this an 8.5/10 potatoes just cause of seemingly endless possibilities and creations, multiplayer was a great addition aswell. the many addons and i think you know the rest. ---points for the long loading times when you have more then 100 addons active
Chinnie the chinchilla;-;Whoever review this game a negative one, i can promise that they are blind
Hail Storm;-;It's difficult to put Garry's Mod into words. It's difficult to say what the game is exactly, because it's whatever you want it to be. This game has literally unlimited potential for new content creation. With what may be the largest modding community ever, Garry's Mod can never fail to impress. It matters not what kind of game you want, may it be realistic or humorous. The game is ours. It's whatever we want it to be.

Scarsz;-;If you don't have this game, I feel sorry for you.
Sepherinno;-;In this game you have endless possibilities do whatever you like, anything your mind can think of you can achieve in this game from building a car to flying a plane. Its a game for people with creative minds. And if you have a creative mind. You will NEVER and i mean NEVER get bored... Its a gem. The game is worth 3x the price it has because really its all hl2 engine games mashed up into a pile of wonderfullnes. Its worth buying trust me buy the game!
Saeko;-;You can pretty much do anything in this game, whether it's by yourself or with others. Finding a server is extremely easy and there are so many gamemodes that you don't have to worry about being bored. I could literally spend the whole day on Gmod and not even realize how much time has passed. I would definitely recommend playing modes like Murder and TTT.
[TBG] Umbranimus;-;Very good sandbox game. You do what you want and you get to do anything. Heck, even scripting is one of them. This game runs on Lua which means players who are experienced with Lua can script on it. There's a lot of player made things on the workshop such as addons that you can also do. They're multiple gamemodes that you can play on such as Murder, TTT, Prop Hunt. This game is packed with 100% FUN. Seriously. Buy it if you haven't already. What are you doing reading this? BUY IT!
/f/dumbo;-;garry's mod is probably the most stupid game i have on steam. the entire thing was made by some dude but now there are multiple people i guess, and it still sucks bad. people wanted something like SFM where you can play with ragdolls and things like that, so a  called Garry Newman made what we today know as garry's mod. the game, visually, is just HORRIBLE. it looks like the jolly green giant took a not so jolly sht. everything is so messy and horribly done, it hurts to look at anything in this game. garry put things like team fortress 2, left 4 dead 2 and half life 2 in this game. i have no idea how he made it so that they all look horrible now, but somehow, he succeeded in doing that. the gameplay is just... bad. there are various gamemodes, including Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town and DarkRP. they all are bad, and this was not surprising when i played this game. hll, i believe i have some actual time on this game and i still think it is horrendous. okay, but on a different side, the fighting is amazing AT BEING SHT i mean, the hitboxes are just bad. you can go up to someone with one of the best guns, and it will probably not even hit them. now, this is a much better game than garrys mod. [i.imgbomb.com] see how the graphics and shooting looks so realistic? if garry's mod was anything like this, i would have liked it much more. Battlefield 4 is much more superior to this excuse of a game. 0/10
Wheatleh;-;Many Gamemodes, So Wow.
Senshi;-;this game made me have ants in my pants from the drilldo in some black girls . very good game i love to play at at my local rent a latop.
iX;-;Trying to explain Garrysmod is trying to explain Charles Darwns evolutionary theory to someone religious... Garrysmod is a game without limitations; If you want to build a giant rocket which flys around making sex noises and dropping  bombs... you can. If you want to run around pretending to be in a triple A fps with better gameplay... you can. If you want to pretend to be in a slender game with friends... you can. You get the point; the game itself is only limited by your own imagination and your willingness to learn... there's communities for everything; "Roleplay, Sandbox/Building, Virtual Lives etc. Even creators can get in the action; with it being open source you can create your own gamemode, entities, weapons and maps. (Check the Garrysmod Workshop for an endless supply of garrysmod content) 10/10 p.s. rustybullethole #garrynewman1stepforward2stepsback

ThiusLord;-;Dark RP is full of children screaming RDM and hackers killing everyone with props. TTT is filled with grown men shouting out "KOS <name>!" Prop Hunt is full of children using a small  prop to hide in places that aren't legitimate hiding spots. "10/10, great game." -IGN

Don't let your dreams, be dreams;-;Man this game man, This game is not your regular type of game, because: 1.Game-Ception, it has multi-gamemode that can be played multiplayer (the singleplayer is only for sandbox) (murder, Prop hunt) 2.Fair price, This game is 9,99 $/ 9$ and by the fact of number #1 its a good price, although they should make it 5$ in a steam sale, that'll be nice. 3. AWESOME GAME. ing, just buy it. Money worth Spend.
Marwan;-;Buy this game if you like to create stuff.
Agent Eva;-;Listen I'll Say This One Time " BAN ME ERS BAN ME " #THE SWORD OF ISLAM WILL RISE
[TBG] Umbranimus;-;Very good sandbox game. You do what you want and you get to do anything. Heck, even scripting is one of them. This game runs on Lua which means players who are experienced with Lua can script on it. There's a lot of player made things on the workshop such as addons that you can also do. They're multiple gamemodes that you can play on such as Murder, TTT, Prop Hunt. This game is packed with 100% FUN. Seriously. Buy it if you haven't already. What are you doing reading this? BUY IT!
Ratc00n;-;I give this game a 10/10 because it's got everything you would want to play with its own twist.
GameTSF;-;Best game I have played. It's really fun in sandbox because you can make whatever you want that involves half life 2 and other things. Also a great thing for servers if you want to play Jailbreak, DarkRP, sandbox and much more! You really should get it!
PineBuckler;-;Make animations with this

2tapsdino;-;Any one with steam should buy this, its cheap, and never seems to get boring. There are always new gamemodes popping out of no where, you can build, roleplay and much much more. There is not really any exuse not to buy this game if you have a decent PC.

Stranger_Danger_Dude16;-;Really-really good game. But it will be better if you buy with Counter Strike Source.
RIP Capo Rest Up;-;Well I had to get a seperate drive for my addons, so there's that. It's fun I guess. Hey did you know you can do some crazy stuff with the models in this game? You could like, download a Tohka skin and like do.. stuff. And there's all sorts of poses and anima-.. Yeah this game's pretty fun.
C;-;For this game you have no goal You can do many things in Garrys mod like playing peoples addons on singleplayer, connect with thousands of servers, make your own workshop items, and can be very creative and make thing I Highly suggest you get this game or you are missing out
Turtle Excell;-;A very fun game to build and role play with many people!
QWP;-;One of the best games ever made. Hours of enjoyment(or frustration) lay before you in this game. Good to play with a bunch of friends in various fun game modes on a vast number of servers with games ranging from Trouble in Terrorist Town(TTT), Murder, Roleplaying servers and Combine Control(probably my favorite). Overall Garry's Mod(or Gmod for short) is really an astonishingly amazing game and for it's price which also goes down much lower during seasonal sales it is worth every dollar, but be warned that Gmod will take time to load at times as the game is purely about modding and playing game modes with those mods. All in all Gmod is a very fun game for the individual or for you and your friends so you should get it and enjoy countless hours in the game.
Pastel I Cri Evry Tim;-;I recommend it cuase its fun

optimuswhat;-;You can kill anything in this game! From Barney's to Nihilanths, and your friends! Lots of gamemodes are available, and those really make the game better. You can create custom items (I personally recommend the Gaben Guns), and make your own maps! You can also play with faces. There's lots of addons to help with you with things like building, shooting, and well, tons of stuff. It's a pretty good game if you enjoy messing around with stuff.

Makage;-;Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by baking. Throughout recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods, having been of importance since the dawn of agriculture. There are many combinations and proportions of types of flour and other ingredients, and also of different traditional recipes and modes of preparation of bread. As a result, there are wide varieties of types, shapes, sizes, and textures of breads in various regions. Bread may be leavened by many different processes ranging from the use of naturally occurring microbes (for example in sourdough recipes) to high-pressure artificial aeration methods during preparation or baking. However, some products are left unleavened, either for preference, or for traditional or religious reasons. Many non-cereal ingredients may be included, ranging from fruits and nuts to various fats. Commercial bread in particular, commonly contains additives, some of them non-nutritional, to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, or ease of manufacturing. Depending on local custom and convenience, bread may be served in various forms at any meal of the day. It also is eaten as a snack, or used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations, such as fried items coated in crumbs to prevent sticking, or the bland main component of a bread pudding, or stuffings designed to fill cavities or retain juices that otherwise might drip away. Partly because of its importance as a basic foodstuff, bread has a social and emotional significance beyond its importance in nutrition; it plays essential roles in religious rituals and secular culture. Its prominence in daily life is reflected in language, where it appears in proverbs, colloquial expressions ("He stole the bread from my mouth"), in prayer ("Give us this day our daily bread") and even in the etymology of words, such as "companion" and "company" (literally those who eat/share bread with you). Contents [hide] 1 Etymology 2 History 3 Types 4 Preparation 4.1 Formulation 4.2 Flour 4.3 Liquids 4.4 Leavening 4.4.1 Chemical leavening 4.4.2 Yeast 4.4.3 Sourdough 4.4.4 Steam 4.4.5 Bacteria 4.4.6 Aeration 4.5 Fats or shortenings 4.6 Bread improvers 5 Properties 5.1 Chemical composition 5.2 Serving and consumption 5.3 Nutritional significance 5.4 Shelf life 5.5 Crust 6 Cultural significance 6.1 Europe 6.2 Latin America 6.3 North Africa 6.4 Asia 6.5 North America 7 Religious significance 7.1 Abrahamic Religions 7.2 Paganism 8 Anti-bread movements 9 In Medicine 10 See also 11 References 12 Further reading 13 External links Etymology The word itself, Old English bread, is most common in various forms to many Germanic languages, such as Frisian brea, Dutch brood, German Brot, Swedish brd, and Norwegian and Danish brd; it has been claimed to be derived from the root of brew. It may be connected with the root of break, for its early uses are confined to broken pieces or bits of bread, the Latin crustum, and it was not until the 12th century that it took the placeas the generic name for breadof hlaf (hlaifs in Gothic: modern English loaf), which appears to be the oldest Teutonic name.[1] Old High German hleib[2] and modern German Laib derive from this Proto-Germanic word for "loaf", which was borrowed into Slavic (Polish chleb, Russian khleb) and Finnic (Finnish leip, Estonian leib) languages as well. In many cultures, bread is a metaphor for basic necessities and living conditions in general. For example, a "bread-winner" is a household's main economic contributor and has little to do with actual bread-provision. This is also seen in the phrase "putting bread on the table". The Roman poet Juvenal satirized superficial politicians and the public as caring only for "panem et circenses" (bread and circuses). In Russia in 1917, the Bolsheviks promised "peace, land, and bread."[3][4] The term "breadbasket" denotes an agriculturally productive region. In Slavic cultures bread and salt is offered as a welcome to guests. In India, life's basic necessities are often referred to as "roti, kapra aur makan" (bread, cloth, and house). In Israel, the most usual phrase in work-related demonstrations is lekhem, avoda ("bread, work"). The word bread is commonly used around the world in English-speaking countries as a synonym for money[1] (as is the case with the word "dough"). A remarkable or revolutionary innovation is often referred to in North America and the United Kingdom as "the greatest thing since sliced bread" or "the best thing since sliced bread". In Cockney rhyming slang, bread means money; this usage is derived from the phrase "bread and honey".[5] History Main article: History of bread Bread shop, Tacuinum Sanitatis from Northern Italy, beginning of the 15th century Bread is one of the oldest prepared foods. Evidence from 30,000 years ago in Europe revealed starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants.[6] It is possible that during this time, starch extract from the roots of plants, such as cattails and ferns, was spread on a flat rock, placed over a fire and cooked into a primitive form of flatbread. Around 10,000 BC, with the dawn of the Neolithic age and the spread of agriculture, grains became the mainstay of making bread. Yeast spores are ubiquitous, including the surface of cereal grains, so any dough left to rest will become naturally leavened.[7] There were multiple sources of leavening available for early bread. Airborne yeasts could be harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking. Pliny the Elder reported that the Gauls and Iberians used the foam skimmed from beer to produce "a lighter kind of bread than other peoples." Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of grape juice and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting, or wheat bran steeped in wine, as a source for yeast. The most common source of leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the previous day to use as a form of sourdough starter.[8] In 1961 the Chorleywood bread process was developed, which used the intense mechanical working of dough to dramatically reduce the fermentation period and the time taken to produce a loaf. The process, whose high-energy mixing allows for the use of lower protein grain, is now widely used around the world in large factories. As a result, bread can be produced very quickly and at low costs to the manufacturer and the consumer. However there has been some criticism of the effect on nutritional value.[9] Recently, domestic bread machines that automate the process of making bread have become popular. Types White bread (left) and brown bread. See also: List of breads Bread is the staple food of the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and in European-derived cultures such as those in the Americas, Australia, and Southern Africa, in contrast to East Asia where rice is the staple. Bread is usually made from a wheat-flour dough that is cultured with yeast, allowed to rise, and finally baked in an oven. Owing to its high levels of gluten (which give the dough sponginess and elasticity), common wheat (also known as bread wheat) is the most common grain used for the preparation of bread. Bread is also made from the flour of other wheat species (including durum, spelt and emmer), rye, barley, maize (corn), and oats, usually, but not always, in combination with wheat flour. Spelt bread (Dinkelbrot) continues to be widely consumed in Germany, and emmer bread was a staple food in ancient Egypt. Canadian bread is known for its heartier consistency due to high protein levels in Canadian flour. Pita is an ancient semi-leavened bread widespread in the Middle East, Levant and South Eastern Europe. White bread is made from flour containing only the central core(endosperm). Brown bread is made with endosperm and 10% bran. It can also refer to white bread with added coloring (often caramel) to make it brown

[HDG] Mr DeeJayy;-;Back when I started playing Garry's Mod, it was something different. People were friendly and were intelligent. But as always, a community comes and a community goes. As you go along, you settle here and there with various online communities, and what not. But lets go over what makes this game unique. This game is HUGELY customizable. With various gamemodes like DarkRP, TTT, and Murder, players have more to do that ever before, and millions of servers to choose from. I currently administrate for a game community, and that can get hectic. It has its faults, but its an all round great game, with plenty of potential to evolve from just a basic sandbox game. Get this game if you enjoy tinkering with stuff. If you just want to pick up and play something without many rules or fiddling, this may not be the game for you.
Tyrannosaurus-Rekt;-;This game is full of suprises. From its vast variety of fun 'messing around' gamemodes like Sandbox or Cinema to the more serious and political DarkRP and Trouble in Terroist Town, to the many addons being created in the workshop everyday. What makes this game even better is that everything is created by others in the community - hence the name 'mod'. Prophunt, TTT, DarkRP, Murder, DeathRun are just some of the game modes I got addicted to. If you're in the right servers, the amount of fun you can have is insane. Then, if you get a server running with some friends, you could play some Sandbox and download many of the thousands of mods available right at your reach. I recommend the M9K weapon packs and Nuke packs (so much death >:D). The only major problem is textures. Counterstrike: Source and Half Life 2 are required for the game, otherwise almost all props and textures will be either a huge error or a pink and black chequred material. This can be easily fixed by downloading the textures themselves if you don't have the games, but it can be quite a hassle. There can also be textures from other games needed like HL: EP1 or 2 or even some non-valve games like Mass Effect 3. Overall, You can have a lot of fun with this game with or without friends, online or offline. Well worth the small price. If I was to rate this game I'd give it a 9.5 for its versitility and wide range of ways to play. I definately recommend it for any hardcore or even casual gamer.
IceTealicious;-;Garrys mod or gmod is an sandbox game that you can play alone or online or via internet. it has no campain and can use buldings, units,maps, npc, material, weapons, and much more from other valve games(half life, counter strike and many more.

Flowx;-;This was one of the best 'games' i've ever seen , there were some restrictions like mapsize and server lag, besides that , you were able to build whatever you want. Another obstacle was , to make a nice contraption you have to spend alot of time in the game (>1000 hours) to aquiere the neccesary skills. The todays problem with this game is that letsplayers started to play this game, wich had no skill at all. (aka. noob)

GLIDE32;-;Garry's mod takes off where halflife 2 ended. You play as the cool guy named Garryman and you have to shoot at everything. Probably the best part about this game is the storyline. Garymans wife was stollen and he has to saver her. I wont spoilps the rest of it though. Garryman is the best game since Obama so if you have the 10$ you should probably not get it. butts/10

DU:HOS | Pete500;-;I love Garry's Mod. One of the reasons it's so great is because it is accualy hard to get bored of it with all the game modes and mods. Are you tired of playing Prop Hunt?

Imagine Dragons;-;I've played over 800 hours of this game!! It is a very easy setup with clear ideas. The game is very popular among a few youtubers. (VenturianTale)... This game involves lots of different ideas, one example being that users can make things called addons. When you go to the Garry's Mod Workshop you can see all the cool and popular builds... The addons are downloaded within 30 seconds top. Then when you start up your game, it's already completely downloaded and ready for your liking. Also the multiplayer setup for users and their friends are very easy to make... Within 1 minute you can have 20 friends on one server!! It is truly amazing, when you get used to the game, you really understand life... I can guarantee that you will have lots of fun. Thank you for reading! Have a good day! -Dinoworld12

theholypork;-;6 year old admin banned me for doing the right thing, 10/10 would get banned again :D
a sheep;-;Feels like the game has just gone down hill since popular YouTuber's have played it. Making more kids want to play it therefore ruining the game :/
Sk0rch;-;This is the best sandbox multi-player game and is easily worth its price if not more. Garrys Mod is where you can make anything (nearly) and download thousands of mods to customize your gameplay to the way it suits you. Choose from different gamemodes like murder (which is alot of fun) and melonbomber (bringing back the memories of Bomber Man). I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good multi-player game. 2nd best steam game ive ever played. (First is Half Life 2) 9.5/10

Stormtrooper;-;This game is great if your feeling creative and or just want to have some fun.
HotPotatoChips;-;May Seem absurd to be a game with no objective, but Gmod does it right. It is filled with player made content and allows for all sorts of gameplay. Some may be put off from the buggy mods available, but if that does not concern you-You should definitely get this game!
Hawaiin Godess Kapo;-;I LOVE THIS GAME I GOT IVE BEEN PLAYING FOR ABOUT 4 HOURS AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT
A Magical Panda;-;Garry's Mod is a bundle of fun and extraordinary happenings. Originally a mod for a Valve game, it eventually was made into a full game for everyone to play. If your cup of tea is a shooter, the game is packed with TTT servers and vice versa. If it's a roleplay, look no further as DarkRP has you covered. Just a plain old sandbox kind of guy? That's the game's specialty! It's on the same tier as one of my other favourites, Blockland. Never the less, I recommend this game for ANYONE and EVERYONE. I guess a straight up 10/10!

Nobody Likes My Stew;-;This game is amazing! You can build what you want, spawn objects and npcs, make vehicles, download thousands of addons from the steam workshop, and even sit in chairs!!! I can't stop playing it. If you get bored get some of you're friends. What's that? You don't have any friends? Well no worry, you can join a server. Have fun!
General Shi Gai;-;You can build a giant . 10/10

HorseshoeofDebt;-;I have played Jarry's Mart for near 1144 hours, so naturally I have earned the right to voice my opinions on not only the infastructure of this game but also Hitler. Walmart takes a few unexpected turns in the form of plot twists, it starts out as a carbon copy of Hamlet and turns into something more similar to "Samurai Harem" by Shakespeared. You can expect a few laughs and a few tears from this beauty of a thing. This game sucks, hands down the worst game since Hitsugi no Chaika: Shadow of Mordor. If you want anything more than a few hours of walking around and pressing Q you might as well get the more superior game; Minecraft: NCAA 08. Hello youtube, this is my tutorial on how to delete winrar 34 xD. Follow these instructions! 1: Download Comic Sans. 2: Delete your 34 Doctor Who meme pictures. 3: Delete windows 33. Done, I hope this tutorial has helped you as much as it helped my Great Uncle, George Washington! I think what Hitler did was both wrong and right, he showed us what a real demagogue could do.

Xtremedog83;-;awsome game with tons of different game modes
Mobius;-;Gmod is a platform - based game where you build and make  and suck on bananas. The whole point of the game is to play different games with squeakers, annoying little fat kids who eat pizza, teenagers who think there cool. Youtubers who troll and get 45 views. Adults who cuss out other people because they think there all big man and cool and they think there something when there not. And then the admins....oh boy where do i start? lets just say that they pour salt and vinagar down there little @sshole and stick a taco from taco bell in there and  everybody over. Great game, love it, love you, pee pee, poo poo.

Einiyeh-Chan;-;I recomend this game because it's just too much fun! You can play different game modes, my favorites are prop hunt and TTT You might not like it first when you don't know how does gmod work. But when you have playin it like atleast 1 - 3 hours with new friends, you will see that it's one of the best game ever. I have already found very good friends, who are worth living for :) Buy this game, play it, have fun !! Peace, I'm out !

SMELLZ;-;im very mad now every time i launch the game it turns off :( i really want my money back please help because i cant even start the game. can i get my money back please :(
Slinky48;-;I don't really enjoy this game. Going through the trouble to find a decent map and waiting for things to download is so time consuming. I just bought it and played it for 3 hours. I did find some games to play but, I didn't enjoy them due to the fact that there was no leading way to complete a mission. Most because you need to download a bunch of "God Knows" to play and then most of the textures aren't there and all I see is Error signs and purple checkered textures fills everywhere. I wish I didn't buy this game and kept my 10 dollars. I wouldn't have even paid 1 dollar if I knew it was like this.

Dr. Matt;-;It's pretty neat
Sebastian;-;Not reccomending simply becuase Garry supports paid workshop. Why wouldn't he support it though? He will be proffiting off of it.
%&$/$&(#() v0.1;-;The game is alright, but the owner thinks that steam's implementation of payed workshop mods is a good idea, which is worrying.
Miles;-;You won't enjoy the game if you're a furry. http://puu.sh/hDGKR/af99dd69ea.png Look like this group like to make fun and harass anyone that's a furry. A friend that's into it found a post that my profile were featured in a thread that was "Find the worst Steam Profile ever". To be honest I find it offensive, even when I wasn't into the forum. I've registered and leaved a reply defending myself, and look what I got after 2 days. I admit something, the game is a blast, but their community, is not. Just nice.

Mr Svenderman;-;With the recent development of Skyrim introducing payed mods, Garry (the maker of Garry's Mod) is thinking of adding payed mods, and I am heavily against it. The idea will work good for those established commercial servers that get a great amount of donations to run, but it will squash the little servers that small amounts of people play on. Allowing payed mods could ruin the game play of many servers. Included is the article about Garry talking about payed mods: http://garry.tv/2015/04/24/paying-for-mods/
DubyaSux89;-;Garry's mod will literally be of no use when paid mods come. UPDATE: The pay for mods model of Skyrim has been removed, but the whole debacle showed the idiocy and immaturity of Garry himself. Though I gave Skyrim a positive review now, I'm leaving this negative review for Garry himself since he's such a . I wish I never bought this game and supported this guy... Though I admired it from afar, once I got it in my hands it really is not that fun anyway. (Note the time played)
Conscript;-;"The exact definition of Jewishness is not universally agreed uponneither by religious scholars (especially across different denominations); nor in the context of politics (as applied to those who wish to make Aliyah); nor even in the conventional, everyday sense where "Jewishness" may be loosely understood by the casual observer as encompassing both religious and secular Jews, or religious Jews alone. This makes it especially difficult to define who is an Ashkenazi Jew. The people have been defined differently from religious, cultural, or ethnic perspectives. Since the overwhelming majority of Ashkenazi Jews no longer live in Eastern Europe, the isolation that once favored a distinct religious tradition and culture has vanished. The center of Judaism today is once again in Israel, although a large community continues to live abroad, particularly in the United States of America, where Ashkenazi Jews live alongside other Jewish groups. Furthermore, the word Ashkenazi is often used in non-traditional ways, especially in Israel. By conservative and orthodox philosophies, a person can be considered a Jew only if his or her mother was Jewish (meaning, more specifically, either matrilineal descent from a female believed to be present at Mt. Sinai when the ten commandments were given, or else descent from a female who was converted to Judaism before the birth of her children), or if he or she has personally converted to Judaism. This means that a person can be Ashkenazi but not considered a Jew by some of those within the Jewish communities, making the term "Ashkenazi" more applicable as a broad ethnicity which evolved from the practice of Judaism in Europe." -Wikipedia, Introduction to Ashkenazi Jews
Linear;-;Garry has insulted and attempted to humiliate those who stand against monetising mods for Valve and the developer's profit. If not stopped now, he will spread this evil idea to Gmod, and that will spell the end of a years long community experience. I will not support this game as long as Garry supports this incredibly vile business practice.
Liam Neeson Punching Wolves;-;Pay for mods, for a mod. My brain.
Dr. Fluttershy;-;EDIT: I'm still going to keep this here. So paid mods have been removed -for now- HOWEVER if they return in the future I have no doubt Garry will attempt to have them added to here, so I am going to caution people against that. Also the community here is one of the most obnoxious I've ever seen in the gaming community so don't expect much out of that either. --V Original Review V-- Looks to be heading in the Paid Mods direction of which I want no part of, mods MAKE this game. Typical of that scumbag Garry to try capitalize on this too, avoid the publisher Facepunch at all costs. I somehow doubt his cute little company would survive the backlash if this happens, unlike Bethesda this isn't a massive 'AAA' title company.
Weegee 1337;-;very good game but i know you *CAN* take away the errors becuse it ruins the game theres so many its terribale so fix that and mabye you will get your first like
Anus McWangus;-;Creator supports paid mods
caliboyjosh10;-;So lame you need to own another game for a game that cost money. What I liked: Lots of different gamemodes you can't get anywhere else What You Need to Know: Don't know how to play any mode Read you need to own counter strike source to get rid of texture errors It's a game where you make your own fun, but has gamemodes if you don't Seems like alot of kids play this game, NO SERIOUSLY ITS ALL KIDS!! GOD DAMN KIDS ARE SO ANNOYING!!! My Score: C Paid: $3 Completed in: ?
Louna;-;The game is just an accidental gem, yet the dev stand FOR paid workshop and he never really did anything for the game since forever. The game haven't been innovative in any way for along time. Not a surprise with Rust too, better fixing Rust too before adding paid workshop to GMOD.
The Dude Abides;-;As far as games go, this isn't really one. Its fun, yes, but it can get quite old after a short while. Also, paying for mods in a "game" like this is just stupid. Paying for mods in any aspect is stupid. Goodbye, Garry Newman. PS, RUST sucks massive eggs.
Maximumbeef;-;Paid mods ruin the community, i won't support any game / developer that introduces them.
BITT3R_G4M3R;-;Garry Newman is anti-consumer, greedy, insults modders/fans & personally for me Garry's Mod is overrated find a better game to play http://garry.tv/2015/04/24/paying-for-mods/ http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/33tqr5/according_to_garry_newman_most_of_the_modding/ http://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/discussions/1/618460171322754966/ EDIT: Valve got rid of the paid mods but don't forget & don't forgive the people supporting this choice they aren't for the consumer http://steamcommunity.com/games/SteamWorkshop/announcements/detail/208632365253244218

[SG]Teebone;-;Best game ever, I have played it for 700 hours
Halrawk;-;With all the game modes and all the workshop items now available, this is a must play. It's a blast to just mess around, and there are more serious game modes to play to. Give it a shot, buy it full price, or wait for sales. Either way I'd say this one is worth it 100%!
SwiftEX;-;I just love that you can spam melons all over the place + all the gamemodes xD

Syndicate.Venum;-;Hello everyone! My name is Infinity from Allias and I'll be writing a review on this game. So,where do we start? Ahh... The Graphics of the game,relatively same to Half-Life 2 the gameplay mechanics are different and it gives the game a brand new experience everytime you hop into this addictive,fun-to-play,sandbox game. I would give it a 4/10 due to the unrealistic graphics and sprinting animations ( REMEMBER YOU CAN ACTUALLY ADD MODS ON THE WORKSHOP INTO THE GAME) Now,For the gameplay In Garry's Mod the game is full of Gamemodes such As TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town ) Prop Hunt and much more This game gives a better feel to sandbox games ( Instead of old lame Minecraft ) All-and-All i would rate this game : 7/10
DaNNy;-;The Best Game !
Sykes;-;Okay so this game is probably the best game ever made. I mean can you use a drilldo to kill your friends on Call Of Duty? Can you accidently fall onto your friend from a building and kill him in Skyrim? Can you laugh so hard in Battlefield? Can you get a triple 420 to the max headshot in Forza? 11/10 Would Spoderman again.

Skrydin;-;Great for friends looking for casual and competetive gameplay.

alexwenbar;-;This game is simple yet is complex. One of the greatests sandboxes ever
[SlyG] Sc00p;-;Garrys mod is the ultimate sandbox game. It plays with physics, mainly in the ways of props, NPCs and models. It uses the parts, models and sounds of any source based game (Mainly Half Life 2 and Counter Strike Source). I have fallen in love with this game, It's use of the source Engine's mechanics is second to none. There are addons for it, these add things like maps, weapons, gamemodes, vehicles and much more. Its multiplayer, like the majoity of all souce engine games, making it great for groups to play together. Things like "Trouble in Terrorist Town' (Formally known as TTT) are game modes. TTT is a great gamemode, made off the fundamentals of betrayal. Garry's mod is an incedible game overall, I highly recommend it. So come on, grab some mates and have a good time. -Sc00p 10/10
Glasses-kun;-;A humorous level builder and a great extension to the Half-Life series. Garry's mod is user friendly when it comes to customization, animation and modifying bits and pieces from other games that you own! Just don't forget to save.

The game is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!

ADispleasedOwl;-;very fun, one of my beat game ive got at the moment. is it worth buying yes 100%.
High King Counter;-;This game was fun, 08-11, but now its just full of TTT or lame RP servers. The glory days of the mod are dead for multiplayer, filled with 12 year olds on the mic, and power abusing admins. No one plays decent modes, like Sassilization, SpaceBuild, its all DarkRP and TTT. Still fun in SP just mucking about. If you are under 15 you will probably like this. Go and ask your mom to buy it for you POS.

This is what i call a "Game Hub", What this means is... Garry's Mod is not a single game, This game has alot of different little games inside of it...The best part is, You wont find a gametype you wont enjoy! So yes. I highly recommand this purchese! :) I hope you have as many fun and entertaining moments with your friends as i have. Goodluck! :)

I have enjoyed many a time with this game playing such gamemodes as Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, and even just messing around in sandbox mode. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes playing with friends, and even random people online!
Skullburner98;-;This game is really fun in the aspect that you can do about anything in it. The only problem is the fact thatyouhave to download certain games for certain gamemodes even though you already paid for g-mod.

FWN | SmileyDead;-;If you own steam and you DONT own this game. You are doing something wrong. Get it! Now! 9/10 on my chart. It's a really fun physics game, that teaches you nothing about realistic physics in the process. What more can you ask?

Kasparov;-;12/10 Would play again
Phoenix Wright;-;Just an awsome game with ALOT of stuff to do :D
Lord Lyght;-;I definitely recommend this to about anyone. You can have the fun of building and the fun of a first person shooter. If you like roleplaying, building, or just about anything there are people who dedicate many hours to make the code for servers. Paying 10$ to buy this game is really worth it. Just 10$ for hundreds of hours of fun!
Phoenix;-;So much fun! Alot better with friends.
SwishNets;-;how to play it online
_luisriveraa_;-;This is a great game to play with friends and even if your playing alone it is still alot of fun! When I saw this game I knew it would be a great game, and it turned out to be true.

hello_90345;-;awesome, you can do whatever you want and let you rage out, the perfect game for sandbox freaks
BouncyBalls;-;Prop Hunt, TTT, Murder, Sandbox, Deathrun, Cinema, Roleplay... This game has something to cater to everyones taste and it's absolutely hilarious. Seriously, you can play this on your own and it's funny as hell.
iTossico;-;It a great fun packed game for only $10. It has an unlimited amount of game types and workshop items, but there are a few glitches when it comes to texturing and renduring.
SexySheep;-;ing YE$ then Ke$ha, good . Best game I've ever played and best money I've ever spent. I'd give this  a 10/10! Must Buy!
FairWarKid;-;GARRY'S MOD ---------------------- + Very much gamemodes + Amazing steam workshop +/- Weird bugs who are a kind of funny + Compatable with other steam/valv games I RECOMMEND THIS GAME Best game evah! 10/10
colepower;-;This game has endless possibilities. You game play for hundreds of hours and still find new things to do. You can get addons for gamemodes, weponds, npcs and just about anything. The one complaint i have is that the game is quite common to have errors and bugs. Overall though I'd rate this game a 9/10.
SmellyJ0E;-;Great game! Garry's Mod has almost any type of game mode that you can possibly want!
Harold;-;This game is probably the only game ive played that is so addictive. Loads of stuff to do on it and doesnt get boring aswell
Coolmonnik;-;This is a absolute MUST-HAVE because: 1.It is a really fun game. 2.Loads of gamemodes 3.It is really cheap
SpikyGreenThing;-;Its fun to blow stuff... yes blow...
Honored Phoenix;-;great game to play with friends and screw around
Red the Fighter;-;This game made the Dragon Balls work once again. (   )
Koolaid;-;I love this game, if you wat to make some friends I would play on the DarkRp servers. DarkRP is a type of roleplaying serever where you pick a job and play as that character. I have many friends who play this game. BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT A GOOD DEAL
Tikacika;-;So addicting that I played 1500 hours of Garry's Mod in a year. 10/10
Xach;-;I had to actually bind a command to a key that kicked people from my servers so they would stop spawning nuclear bombs. 10/10
madminer95;-;non stop craziness and endless possibilities for fun, nuf said
Fresh Prince of Liberia;-;This is the best game in the world. I have had so many fun and memorable times on this game. It can be a funny game, or an edge of your seat heart pounding action game, or a racing game, or even Dayz. Which ever one you play your gonna have fun. Because of all of these gamemodes this game never gets boring. IF U LIKE VIDEO GAMES YOU WILL LIKE GMOD, Dont believe me? just look at my gametime. And whats unbelievable is that this game is only 10 dollars THATS CRAZY i have had more fun on this game then on games that cost $100 This game feels like a $2000 game not a ten dollar one so dont be understimated by the price. BTW the 2 most popular gamemodes are TTT and DarkRP (I Prefer DarkRP).
Gangster Black Kid;-;Killed an admin, got banned. 10/10
Pigeoncracker;-;You're on crack the whole time.
MrBurnen;-;I really like this game. There are so much different things you and your friends can do. You can choose to set up your own server or join servers that others have made! Everything from threwing stuffs into the air and take a seat in your homemade rocket! AWSOME GAME! But there is two things I complains about. The first thing is that it's impossible for me to save. I search everywere for it and can't find a way to save. I found a button, it said "Game saved" but it didn't saved anything! But you can save items though.. The second thing is all of those greefing around the servers. When you put some stuffs on the ground, there are many who takes your stuffs ant throws tham away. (Many servers have turned this off)
Chopper;-;this game is good
FG. Tiger;-;Garrys Mod is an awesome sandbox game where you use your creativity to bulid and do what you want.
Steve The Canadian;-;It's Awsome... Nuff Said
rydawggie03;-;xcuse me i need help, when my Garry's mod crashed i had to make my screen 3 sizes smaller. my regular screen size is 1024x720 but arter my game crashed i had to make my screen 1380x768 can steam or someone help me
DiGiTaL CLeaNeR;-;If you are a engineer nerd type, this is a great mod. If you don't like figuring out how to use complicated software config's you'll love this.
Mop the Goon;-;garrys mode is a very bad game for very bad people if u read this u will die in 30 seconds l;ol jk it was all a ruse i got u buy it now ior ill stab uy 17469345/1977777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777

He is a  noob  pro;-;I made a man be my dog on a dark rp server with drugs, 10/7
Ixtilion;-;Lots of funny and stupid mods, will get some laughs out of you. It's better if playing with friends (hide and seek, TTT, ecc), will get some laughs out of you!

Gowerpowerz;-;PROBABLY the BEST game on steam so many fun addons
jpm1234567;-;can't go wrong with this game there is something for everyone. I reccomend playing half life 2 first. If you do you will really respect the game more.
Toratsugu;-;11/10 would spawn babies again.
WisdomPunk;-;Got ran over by a guy with cake on his head riding a tub with thrusters 11/10 would get ran over again
RBMRoman;-;Joined DarkRP, got shot and killed by an Error, and then banned for RDM. 10/10
3hunna Bang Bang Sosa;-;Whoever dosent like gmod is preety dumb. The best part about it is that in murder, i give out free hugs.
Mecha Moid;-;it's a great game with lots of hours to play, i have played 3,233 HOURS and yes HOURS in this game and it still is not boring, i would recommend this game to all types of gamers.
Dunksten;-;Garry's Mod brings me back to the feel of Half Life 2, except with ridable Heavies. Garrys Mod is everything I love in a game, freedom to do whatever you want, modding capability, and multiplayer. Its like having all the Valve games in one. To think that this was once a mod for Half Life 2! There is so much potential in this game and that is the reason i love it.
CombustaBear;-;10 minutes into a sandbox server and my cousin and I built bathtub rocketships that could travel faster than the speed of light. There's Garry's Mod for ya.
iXton;-;Garry's Mod is the definition of "build anything you like." It's amazing to see how one can toy around with the source engine while having a blast and Garry's Mod gives you the tools to use it. Even though it's a sand box that you will enjoy for plenty of hours to come, I found myself bored playing alone trying to build, which made me realize that some people (like myself) may need someone to play with in order to enjoy it and sure enough, Garry's Mod delivers with so many Game mods, I need a new hard drive to fill.It's a silly sand box that I can guarantee that any open minded person will enjoy. Well worth the price.
Vaughanie;-;Garrys Mod - Sick game must play or you missing out soo bad!
Willlovesgame;-;this game is probably one of the best games ive played it has something for everyone you hate spongebob? blow up the the krust krab! like 7 eleven go inside and have a look! a great game for every one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mechfruit;-;I highly recommend GMod. Loads of modibility and almost limitless things you can do.
Mad~ #Will Go Gay 4 HSC;-;ing. epic.
Pondus;-;If you love limitless sandbox creativity, this game is for you. If not, no one likes you, so get the hell out.
a boot named Frank;-;This game is very fun and you really have the chance to do anything you want
Fj_Vr;-;Got it as a gift, downloaded it, played it. Now i can't stop playing. But the load times and the downloads everywhere are ultra annoying. 9.5/10
Captain Toasty;-;Its a good game with alot of features.I thinck you should try it out.Even my sad fox says you should
CoolHandWiz;-;This game is worth the little money it costs. When I first got the game I purely bought it for the creative aspect of the game. I bought it with a few friends thinking that I would play a few hours of it and thought the few dollars I spent were well used. However, after a few weeks I got bored with creating and moved on to other games. It was actually till another friend told me about this cool new alien game mode for Garrys Mod called Morbus that I got back on. From that point on I was hooked. There are very few games that I have played as long as this one and I think it can be credited to the replay-ability and versatility of this game and the game modes its players create. TTT, Murder, Morbus and many other game modes offer hours and hours of fun and since this game is normally always on sale on steam I would recommend it to anyone with a few dollars to spare.
Profile Name;-;I ABSOLUTLY love this game so far. Definatly worth the money.
Magmus;-;In all a great game. At times it gets dull, if so than swich to a different game or take a break. So ya good game -Dragonborn
The Gay Inquisition;-;I love this game, is it pretty top! Just know that you have to have Counter Strike: Source to play. They're so many things to do and so many hours to burn. If you have the extra money, pick it up and I think you'll find something you enjoy in it.
conker561;-;Endless hours of funnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!
Tactical Swag;-;Hours of fun await you when you buy this game. 8/10
DogeyDogeWord;-;Yus ish is best gam of muy life
Koroshi (PangPond);-;THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I LOVE GMOD!!!!!!!!!
Acemer;-;Hours of fun THOUSANDS no, MILLIONS of possibilities The amout of things you can do in this game is overwhelming A Great buy, you wont regret it!!!
FluffytheCat;-;this would be the definition of the game you don't take seriously...
NonstopRiver;-;great sandbox game (many things too do)
Eric Cartman;-;this is a absaloutly great game you can play what you want and make what you want whatever type of game your into it is all in this game
Scrappy;-;If you have a small , don't get this game.
Leo;-;TTT is one of the most diverse pc games i've ever played
Mishchap;-;I put a train in the air and left it there and lit it on fire while hanging people and crashing the game by spawning 10/10 ed up physics also get the orange box and css, it'll improve the gameplay much more (essentially you need half life 2)
Bear;-;So I spent 215 hours on this game. 215 hours = 8.95 DAYS 215 hours = 1 WEEK 215 hours = 0.29 of a MONTH 215 hours = 0.02 of a YEAR 215 hours = 12900 MINUTES NOW THINK OF WHAT YOU COULD DO IN THAT TIME... SCARY RIGHT? 10/10 - WOULD SPEND MY LIFE ON IT
Chronos2K;-;If you like doing anything you want then this game is for you
Sweggy;-;A really fun and interesting game! This game can be played well both alone and with friends. The amount of things you can do in this game is practically endless (with mods of course), which allows for many hours of fun and laughter. I really recommend this game to anyone who wants to kill time.
B@man;-;very funny and fun
Nova;-;Picture a game where you can build anything,design anything,create anything imaginable. Want a 2014 Ford Mustang Shelby with a Rocket strapped to the top? You got it. Want too run around and spend numerous hours building a structure only to build yourself a RPG and destroy it from top to bottom? Got it. Still want thatcake that they promise? Well sorry it doesn't have the cake :(
kanade-chan;-;omgerd! its amazing i met my bestfriends in it ^-^ its a great game i love it its prob one of the best game ever!
Zuzupeste;-;Its a very good game because any one can play it...the only limit you have is your imagination

DvZDeMoN;-;its really cool
nelson;-;What do I need to say other than "its Garry's Mod?" Have fun!!
Rusty-;-;Buy It if you haven't allready!
Simmy;-;This game is the best game I ever played, I had a lot of "lulz" and I became an admin on a server. This game is the best. Okay, the graphics aren't good, but hey, it's made from a 2004 game engine and we still play it in 2014. What was simply a mod for Half Life 2 became one of the most modded game of the steam store. This game is the proof that you shouldn't care about the graphics and look at the gameplay... 'n stuff. This game never ends, you can play it for 600 hours without even being bored! Just awesome! 10/10
Tekage;-;This is a fantastic, extremely entertaining game which I love to play with friends. The gameplay is fantastic and I love the workshop. The only problem I have with it is that you have to buy Counter Strike Source with it in order to experience the online sensation that this game provides. So even though you have to pay a little bit extra in order to get the full experience, it is all worth it. I definetly reccomend this to everyone.
MagicAsianPanda;-;Great game full of diverse possibilities.
ShortZGai;-;I LOVE THIS GAME ITS LIKE MINECRAFT I REALLY RECCOMEND THIS TO EVERYONE
J0e B@rbaro;-;Gmod got everything that you want. MLP TF2 Cod DUKE NUKEM CS:S DOD HL2 and more!!
420;-;Love it!
Devil'zzz;-;Ah Garry's Mod. This game might actually have everything in it! (With the help of the Steam Workshop Community) Seriously, if you want to build stuff, fighting zombies, become a banana, murder people, become a traitor and much more. This is one of the games that every gamer must own. If you haven't heard or watched anything about Garry's Mod then you're lying. It's totally worth your money. If you don't have this game yet, buy it!!! 10/10
Special;-;Garry's Mod (GM) is a virtual world developed by Linden Lab launched on June 23, 2003, and is accessible on the Internet. A free client program called the Viewer enables its users, called Residents, to interact with each other through avatars. Residents can explore, meet other residents, socialize, participate in individual and group activities, and create and trade virtual property and services with one another, or travel throughout the world (which residents refer to as "the grid"). Garry's Mod is for people aged 18 and over.

ISSE - donate skins or cases;-;More than Awesome Funny Scary Fun Stressful #WORTH IT
kung fuhrer;-;me and two friends trapped a pubescent 9-yo in a closet and he made a pink  i cried
Spookie-Man;-;This game is an amazing game really fun to play. This is both good for singleplayer and multiplayer. Really recommend this to everyone.
YOU ARE A SWAG FAG;-;This game is just simply amazing, does most of what you want it to do, and contains a variety of gamemodes like: sandbox, cinema, darkrp, deathrun, prophunt, and many more gamemodes. Garrys mod is much more fun when you have other people to play with or even if you are by yourself you can make friends with other people online, and downloading other peoples creations (mods) are th best as you get time to play around with them all. Brilliant for people who like minecraft and want to create a world, but in life of what it is like today.
Lolicon Knight;-;Fun and enjoying it especially with friends :3
Immortality;-;I think this is a good game for if you r bored to go on the workshop and just mess around. Definetly a 10/10
Siglamii;-;9/10 IGN, "Not Enough Half Life 3"
Mr. GurdurrYoShit;-;This game has so many game modes! I absolutely love it! 10/10
Shit;-;I love this game and it's limitless possiblity's
Curiosity;-;Totally worth it. (also my play time)

SaintRow99;-;Garry`s Mod is fun game i like it i will play more
Shockwave3905;-;Pros 1. All of the fabulous WorkShop Items 2. Many servers so the fun never ends 3. Bathtubs 4. All the Sweg Cons 1. s 2. RDM 3. Prop Kill 4. Prop Spam
Makigumo;-;One of the best games i played. Many gamemodes and Servers. It pays out to only buy it for trouble in terrorist town gamemode. 10 bucks and much more! 10/10
NitroCSC;-;Thanks garry
DR.Siri (G);-;coolness my awesomeness is upgrade to mega fun for real!
Lane Carver;-;This game is purely amazing. Period.
dumb;-;Very fun. Prop hunt is my fav. Would reccomend! Worth the buy!
HonkWave;-;This is my personal favorite game ever. This game is worth all of your time and money. While on the outside it just looks like a Half-Life sandbox game. It is so much more than that. Sure there is singleplayer and its fun but this game is all about the people. Setting up a server can be hard but joining a public one is fun and easy. There are so many ways to play, These are a few of my favorite. TTT (Trouble In Terrorist Town) is all about false trust and communication in a world of evil people. Prop Hunt is just a crazy Hide and seek. Murder is a easy way to play TTT. Cinema is a great way to pirate movies. and sandbox just turns into making cannons and killing everyone. Howerer you play make sure you talk to people. I have met so many awesome friends through this game. We just hang out and have a good time. That should be the motto of Gmod "Just hang out and have fun".
danathan;-;Pretty much all I play
BetaMuWolf;-;Love that this game has so many other games. makes playing it less boring
logoster;-;LOTS of fun, still have all kinds of fun things to do, very very active modding community, just an insane amount of fun, i highly highly reccomend this game
ounut;-;When it comes to sandbox there is nothing greater than garry's mod. You all say Grand Theft Auto is sandbox. You haven't even touched this editable masterpiece. In addition to the beauty of the game in general many people create things to enhance it more. This is a must buy for all valve lovers.
Space Jambi;-;One of the best games i've ever played, ever
Peridot | TF2PF;-;Make rocket powered  while Mossman gets punched in the face by Heavy who's also being  by Cortana. 10/10 would make GMOD video with obvious Fraps/Bandicam watermark
Fucked by Strong Neighbourhood;-;gr8 b8 m8 l0aded with child pornography. Police raided my house and before I could get up and delete my whole hard drive, constable macintosh opened my disc tray and 30 editions of itty bitty 12 year old titt13s burst out. I am now typing this from jail where I have been the prison  for 12 ing years and not once have I had my salad tossed. In fact, i usually just tongue my cell mates  hole every night GG/10
[RH] [TFG] Lila;-;this is a very fun game lots of guns and weapons etc. to kill stuff and you can create your own server :D I recommend this game alot!
{TABP}SheepyJ;-;Exceltly built game, save for the many glitches that occur during gameplay. Also, for any new users, i would reccomend finding tutorials on the Internet or in Steam because it does not give sufice instructions in the game itself.
TryReplay;-;This game is a fun to play multiplayer game. I suggest you get counter strike source though.
TheDuckVoice;-;I RECOMMEND THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ITS FUN FUNNY AND YOU CAN PLAY WITH FRIENDS!!!
Divine of Goddess;-;Fun game, Trolling friends, making friend mad, and other types of fun
[dudeswh]  DimasRMDO;-;Ha! Fun game! You can do almost anything in the game! You can make a lot of stuffs like rocket and cars, or you can just wandering around in the game.... Need other games to work perfectly though like CS:S. There are a lot of gamemodes! I might say that this is like an all in one game.
Sterling Archer;-;Garry's mod is a Half-Life 2 mod that was released in 2006 and was later given it's own game. Garry's Mod has pratctically endless things to do. Pose ragdolls, roleplay with other players, play Trouble in Terrorist Town with friends or other players, and thousands of other things tyo do. Don't like one mods? Go play another! Don't like any of the maps? Go and download more off of the Steam workshop! Don't like the default graphics? Go download some modifications to make the game look better! Pros+ Runs off of the source engine, so you can run it on a potato or a toaster Nearly infinite addons giving you more possibilities in game Large, and still growing community with stunning screenshots and artwork Small download Difficult to get bored of Cons- Long loading times, even with all of the servers' addons Dependant on textures from other games (Counter-Strike: Source, CS:GO, HL2, Ep1, Ep2, DOD:S, etc.) Squeakers like crazy Butthurt multiplayer admins Lazy developer The game in my opinion deserves a 9/10 on a good day, but most days I just want to kill everybody in the world after I play this game.

AK;-;Garry's Mod, ing amazing game Summer 2013, I spent every single night until 4AM playing and screaming in Garry's Mod, my parents would get so  off at me, but I couldn't help it, this game is so fun, "open world" and addicting. The amount of gamemodes available is unreal, I couldn't recommend this game more, I would also recommend you to spend an extra couple of bucks for CS:S and HL2 just for the full expiriance, every single one of those 500 hours were worth it, go ing buy this game now!
Mega_Pixel;-;Best physics sandbox I've ever played.
The Doctor;-;Very Brilliant Game!
jdm ftw;-;Best game to showcase the capabilities of the source engine.
MINDBLOWN;-;it is a name with a mod
Motivational Shia;-;Was a bucket and then i was killed "10/10 would bucket again"
CanadasFinestGamer;-;+1 GREAT GAME, many different game modes ranging for children to adults. Amazing communities, new gamemodes always getting made . Garry's mod a sandbox game where you can make your ideas reality, atleast in Garry's Mod, it never gets old we keep trying new gamemodes that keep us thrilled and wanting more a great game i'd recommend especially compared to its great price. The only negative thing is you almost %100 need CSS or else everything will be purple...
Bosmosis Scones;-;With well over 1,000 hours logged here, I can without a doubt say this is one of the most fun, interesting, player friendly games I've ever played. Im the type of person who will play a game religiously for weeks but then toss it aside when I've played it through. Not with Garrys Mod. This game has such great functionality and constant new (player made) content, it's literally impossible to get bored or have nothing to do. This game has kept me entertained for years and I've seen the good and the bad. All in all i would HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone.
lava1709;-;You can BE Watermelons 20/10
zeremot;-;Very nice game nice game mechanics,graphics etc.
[SS] OFFICER FRIENDLY;-;A very creative game. i recommend this game to those who enjoy a game like minecraft.

ODD BY FUTURE;-;i really like this game because it has alot of gamemodes and servers you can choose that are really fun, i think lots of people are enjoying it at the moment and i totally recommend this game.
wesstr;-;I have hosted many servers to play with friends and still can find more to do with this game then i can with my life. Literaly there is nothing confining anything or anybody. Therefore if it exsists then its in garrys mod.
[NAS]Peter Griffin;-;WHAT THE ACTUAL  DID I JUST PLAY AND LIKE...
Mark The Great;-;very good game amazing for price i play many hours and still have much fun. dis game creation many legends and i for won feel that theres's too much to do. there is so much that this game gets spooky. butt in a good way. two have fun one must play TTT or DarkRP and troll/raid/havefun if i were to be ibm and rate this game i'd' give it a 9-10 reason for this is beacuse ggame could have 10 year old hobos and those hobos are FAKS. they just blast music all the time. like why are you blasting music all the time? I dont know why do you ask me? anyway this game deserves a 10/10 go buy it,.

Cold Pyro;-;Its meh.
Epic4ninja;-;I may not have played like 500 hours on this game but the ammount of time i have played has been so much fun. i have done so many stupid things in sandbox and have gotten SO MANY things from the workshop. I can spend tons of time browsing the workshop for awesome addons and then spend even longer messing around with those items in game. 11.47/10.5 would play again
WhiteKnight;-;With many different gamemodes, you will be spending tons of hours of this game. It's fun and it tests your creativity.
C4pt4inSp0ng3;-;best of 2006 :D

Infamous Quasar;-;Garry's Mod. How to put it. This game strips me of all words it's so amazing. You millions of maps to play with and so many weapons to aquire. Subsribing to a mod is a click of button.....WOW! From NPCS, to Roleplay servers, to LAN parties, to TTT, to Murderer, to Sandbox. It's your world, your game. This game is a 30/10. (390 hours on record....addict much? xD)
Dip Onion;-;This games okay... but it's really in gay.
Amanda Todd DA Real MVP;-;Best game 10/10 (Only posting to get a badge)
Solsagan;-;What can i say? This game lets you do what ever you want. Untill your game crashes :c
FrostyFFA;-;Garry's Mod, Sandbox at its finest, the workshop for this game makes it an even more amazing game. You can never play too much of this game i have played 200+ hours and would love to play more. Multiplayer gamemodes such as Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), Murder and Prop Hunt are just a couple of my favourite gamemodes. I would absolutely recommend this game if you are new to steam or are an experienced Gamer. I would have to rate this game a solid 9/10 I...<3...Gmod ~JuggerChooChoo
CamoUnchained;-;This is great fun online with such fun modes like murder, prop hunt and trouble in terrorist town just to name a few. I highly recommend this game as it will probably never get old as new modes and mods are released throughout the large community of players
Your Gynecologist.;-;Was on a server someone threw a bathtub at me and killed me 11/10
All Knowing Owl;-;OKEEEY this game..this game man it's something It's a sandbox mod for pretty much every source game and there are many diffrent things you and your friends can do with also many awesome muiltiplayer modes that are real funny. OFFICAL SCORE 8/10
Factory New Anal Beads;-;Such a good game do recomend it to all people
JavaFish;-;Great game! :D
Beeblico;-;Most fun and laughs I have ever had on any game. Any glitches or spazzy occurances just make the game better! The Trouble in Terrorist Town gamemode is amazing.
EgN| Umreeca;-;TTT and Murder have to be the funnest games I've ever played. It's definetly underpriced in my opinion. I would reccomend getting GMOD in a bundle with Counter Strike Source.
SpoiL;-;God.. Its like.. The best game ever, Im not joking. I have over 4500 hours on the game and i do not regret it. So, let me make it clear, You can fly through walls and build crazy machines and such more, And you wont make it the game of the year?  it, Best game ever!? 9/10
LaziNoah;-;This game is funny :T
MultiNightsniper;-;Garry's Mod Most........Everything So what else do i need to say?
Speedhog22;-;This Game ist the BEST sandbox Game i've ever met! I thought I own the best game in the world, but Garry's Mod show me that im not. The creativity of GMod is endless and funny! (#thrusters).
Fidget;-;If You Dont Like This Game Your Not Human! 9.5/10

|NerP|TBB| Nerdwagon;-;I have waisted 735+ Hours of my life playing this game! I like how you can install mods easy from the Steam Workshop, Would reccomend if you like waisting hours and hours of your life. 9/10, Nothing else to explain, Usless review below. 12 out of 32940813410384 (1%) found this review helpful. OMG DUH I LUVE SWINGING RAGDULLS ALL OVER THE PLACE! 11/10 WUD DO DAT AGUEN.
KiraHYamato;-;Good game to play with alot of people
[WsG] Br0ski;-;9 out of 10 This game is fun to screw around in. You really meet some interesting characters on the servers. Least you will get a good laugh out of your experience. A ton of mods and I am telling you - It is fun. And the game is so old you are bound to get it on sale.
sLeepY;-;This is an amazing game. filled with random things. WORTH BUYING IT!!!
sLeepY;-;This is an amazing game. filled with random things. WORTH BUYING IT!!!
herpumii;-;This is a "must own" in your library. But to play it without errors/missing textures/wireframe walls, windows etc. get C:SS.
cloudsora;-;So much to do, it's garry's mod.
mlg_pro_dude;-;funny and great sandbox game!
Lightning;-;great game! met some awesome people on it and have lots of fun. xD this is the only game which, in my oppion, never gets reptivtie. 10/10
munchmario;-;i have at least 2 of my friends playing it at anypoint in time madness
[MLG] Gear Death;-;Its really a perfect game do what ever you wan't mod anything you want. If you get bored play around with more mods and revive your bordem.
sonicgamer1011;-;this game is the best sim game ever
Philo Beddoe;-;This is a great game to play with freinds
Kr31zy;-;MUAHAHAHHAAHHA nearly 600 hours spent, do i really have to say anything?
Jeffrey;-;It's one of my favriote games of all time ranking at second. The ammount of things that you can do in it is to large to even place a number on with addons made and poested daily by the community, sure the controls are a little weird but there's nothing like a little practice.
scleight1011;-;Very fun game REALLY worth the money, but ber sure to get counter strike so you can have all of the textures so you can see everything.
PlantedKhan05;-;GREAT game, i mean whats better than a game where anything is possible
Will;-;An amazing game with tons of gamemodes, if you don't like bolting props together and making mad contraptions (Sandbox), you can find a traitor (Trouble in Terrorist Town or TTT), race other people (Gmod Racer), live in a virtual house bought with virtual money from a virtual job (Roleplay), pretend you're a TV and hide (PropHunt) and run through traps activated by another player. All this and much more in a very flexible, incredibly varied game. Or you could just play on one server and gamemode all the time, ahem, 420 | black shadow.

The FNAF Gamer;-;This is an extremely fun game: Pros: *Do anything you want *Physics from Half-life 2 *You can insert other steam games to use the props and everything in that game. Cons: *Crashes randomly *Some people online are jerks *Have to download other games for textures like half-life 2. Over all it's 50/50 but i still recommend it to anyone who likes causing destruction.
Buttlet;-;i turned a watermelon into a 30 nukes 1293875623756912387469283746/10
TLK;-;This game is a lot of fun. Be sure to have friends if you get it though because this is terrifically boring if you play alone. The idea behind this game is that you download addons to play different games everytime. Whether you are playing trouble in terrorist town, prophunt, or a murderthon in sandbox, you are sure to have a blast! This game reminds me a bit of minecraft because of it's replayability, and the fact that there are so many ways to play this. 9.5/10. The only thing keeping this game away from a 10 is the fact that I have encountered several problems browsing addons, including a lack of an OBVIOUS search bar. There is a way to search, but it takes some experimentation and discovery to figure it out.
[LP]Groot;-;Garry's Mod, my goto game to waste time. This game has a gamemode for anyone, from formal RP to Prophunt or TTT. There are lots of things on this game to eat up your time and a really easy LAN system that is very good for a LAN Party!
A D;-;If you like Sand Box style games, mini games, building random machines and controlable objects, or just to FSU, this is the game for you. Garry's Mod is probably the ultimate game of making and breaking. It gets better if you lan up with people or join variuse servers that would hold Sand Box mode or other game modes. The only real downside is that sometimes you need certant map/character/item textures to be able to see some game modes or to even play on them. Most are free but there are others that you need to buy another game entirely for. The content that you're going to want to look through especially is anything in the Garry's Mod Work Shop hidden within the Addons section. From cars to boats to planes to weapons to maps to NPC's, you've got alot to choose from. Definately would recomend this game to anyone who loves to laugh.
He who shall not be named;-;great game!!!
Rainbow Dash;-;this game is awsome as hell!!!!
Sanybaby;-;this is the MOST modable game ever and its got 60+ game servers in it each with its own game mode so i could play this for almost ever!
kiLLcaM;-;you can make yourself a duck 10/10
SpikyX;-;TRUSTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10/10
Pancake847;-;You can fly in a bathtub.
Old Clock | N/A;-;very fun, awesome workshop, great multiplayer all round awesome game
Legend;-;I love it so much but I dont want to spend 20 dollars just to get the textures :(
TheXXzgamer;-;I've had so many fun hours with this game with TTT alone, and my first 50 were from singleplayer. I've met so many wonderful people and I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even a social life 10/10
Chutanda;-;This is my absolute favorite game on Steam.Other than this being a build anything type of game, there are many different gamemodes to try. The only annoying thing about this game is the fact that you need other games to see *some* textures. (But there are loopholes to that.) A cheap game, that has great quality, and many possibilities.
zack;-;Great game for  and giggles, and a great game to play when having LAN parties! This game well let you make just about anything you can think of. Buy it.. You know you want it. 10/10
Chronolynx;-;Love this game!
Julius1337;-;In my opinion i see no reason to not like this game. This game has pretty much every thing to do you could imagine you can make gueg working machines drive in vechles make scenes have big battles have small battles experiment with physics experiment with ragdolls play with friends in the many fun gamemodes and much MUCH more this game has pretty much any gameplay you want and you have the power to change it at will this is a sandbox game so there is no story so dont expact that you can create one however check out youtube if you want to see what people do with this awesome game.
ALicensedGamer;-;Elevator Simulator is the single funnest game mode i have ever played 10/10, would ride again
DimixiaN;-;Buy this game and start creating your crazy things !!!

Rogue Cheney [Away on Holiday];-;If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob a bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.
Hans;-;i wish i had more time to try this game out altered roleplay is the best community ever tho
Star_Hawk_;-;Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway. "Where do I start?" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm... _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more. _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore. _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds. _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want. _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10 Overall 8.5 Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod -Star_Hawk_

Valiantttt;-;Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming. If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh). There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers. A great game with a good community if you know where to look.
Hoffa;-;You don't log 6000+ hours in a bad game if you get what I mean. http://youtube.com/Hoffa1337
FB||Gillan_Greenleaf | KinguWIN;-;When I first bought this, my friend said "not a game, bro." He was right. It's not a game. It is your world. Do with it what you wish.
Shark Bait;-;You can spawn watermelons. 10/10
orane;-;An amazing game. Truly the first game with infinite free DLC. With millions of maps and plenty of gamemodes, Its a win.
TakoFeel;-;i want 1.6k hours of life back 10/10 best gaem
Joi+PLAY;-;This game is utterly amazing with the amount of stuff (pointless or not) that you can do. Watch an epic battle unfold in this video... 10/10, hours of fun. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9lN64n0H-Q
Beagle_fac;-;One of the greatest if not the best sandbox game that I own/exists. The possiblities with the base game are virtually endless, with the steam workshop they are literally infinite I reccomend that every steam user tries gmod at least once.
Gree_Thomz #LeKawaiiPotato;-;Potato... No, i mean... it's is a really addictive game when you see it you are like " Pff this game is le worst  haha" when you play it though... You are like... THANK GOD THIS GAME IS ALIVE!!! So buy this game or i'll kill you (SRSLY!)
Moor problems;-;i flew around smoking weed to kill the dinosuars then road my dugong into the sunset 10/10 would cause another dinosaur extinction
Father Littlecaveman123;-;really fun to play with friend and best with a group of stupit people.
Grumpy Cat;-;If you're looking for a game that you can just mess around in, laugh with friends, and blow stuff up, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU (Mic strongly recommended)
Doug Dimmadome;-;Lots of owning noobs 10/10 would buy again.
Pubby;-;When I play this game I ejaculate, "Kittens".
Bill Nye the Nazi Spy;-;What other game could you have Pikachu and Commander Shepard having sex with a cardboard cutout of a cow? What else could you need in a game? 69/10
Lucifer;-;Very fun game to play with friend.. :)
JarvisFTW;-;The game itself is fun but when you get more gamemodes the possiblilites are limitless.
Tunnel Snake Walrus;-;This game is for when you wanna build and Silly around using Hl2 Engine and all of the other Hl2 Engine/Hl1 Engine games you have
Wormyguy;-;Best. Game. Ever. Period. Well, this is an "in-depth" review sooo... First of all, you can never be bored on this game and you will always be doing something crazy, unless you're a serious person. The more creative you are, the better. You can build many structures and even build robots with all the tools at your disposal. There are ragdolls, props, vehicles, and many maps to offer. The game gets even better when you add the workshop. The community makes content that you can download and there are in-game community-made dupes that you can screw around with. Garry's Mod also has spawned many ridiculous and fun gamemodes, like GMod Tower, Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), Prop Hunt, Murder, STOP IT! Slender, and many more. Overall, this game is totally worth $9.99 (that is how much I bought it for) and it should be worth more because you can play games within a game in GMod. That is crazy, much like this game.
gloves;-;i made a giant  in my first 4 minutes of playing and killed the entire server and got banned 10/10
Arkham Knight;-;Good game Has Alot of Addons and gamemodes! i only play this game mostly it's cool try it!!!
Boolin;-;An exceptionally astounding source of entertainment for anyone sophisticated or immature. No other games are executed as well as this in the sandbox-style genre of gaming. Whether you are building complex contractions or laughing at the silliness of the game, you can use your imagination and play a delightful game at the same time. Garry's Mod is definately a video game worth investing in.
DEWY28;-;This game is the type of game that help you with you creations that you always wanted to make
Captain Ghost;-;This game has all the stuff you need, from Ragdoll's to equipment's, and the most funniest and coolest thing is that you can build mostly anything too. But from my point of view on what I like about this game, is launching ragdoll's into the air and putting NPC's ( Non-Playable Character's) holding gun's, making them look like a bodyguard. So, if you are a big fan of creation, then this game is *RECOMMENDED* for you. Good Luck and Have a Blast!
Angry blenny;-;Great sandbox game!
Rocket;-;JUST AWESOME!!!
sentientdorito;-;What is a keyboard? It says I need one for this game. How am I writing this review if I don't have a keyboard? Please help I am confused.

THe JoK3R;-;dude after getting this game i dont know what to do but it was awesome with a great community 11/10
ReichFuhrer Rundstedt;-;This game is probably the best sandbox there is. I haven't played many games where you had this much freedom. I have a friend who owns this, but still thinks minecraft is better, but he doesn't know anything, Gmod is 10x better.

MeekMingeMaster;-;SO DAMN FUNNNNN , cant get over how, i used to just play gmod to build,then i got it 5 years later (2 months ago) and i found out there were minigames, whoops, and it makes the game so much better, 6.9/6.9
Stay Fit;-;Take my review as a 'Ok' or 'Not Ok' I have over 2,000 hours. Yes I do have a life. it's just a game you get addicted to and I've had it for about 3-4 years now. I've been banned on every single darkrp server *not the newer ones* and working on sandbox... just because IGN rated it a 0 doesnt mean its a bad game. that's there **opinion** so I recomend you to buy this game, only downside is you need either CS:S or half Life 2, Gameplay: 9.5 Graphics: 6 overal: 10/10 get this game and join the fun Also!!! there are over 100's of gamemodes. DarkRP Trouble In Terrorist Town Sandbox*original* Deathrun PropHunt Hide n Seek Survival ...etc Check out youtube vids Mulitplayer: 10.5

manhunterx3000;-;would I recommend this game to someone... yes it has endless new items bulid and coded for you to blow up, make them dance ( i have done with a car ), or change the colour of them to pink, green, blue,gold, or anything you think of. Just don't forget, its your play space
David Vonderhaar;-;This game is kinda Like Minecraft, except totally diffrent. It has the same "The possibilites = Your creativite" aspect that Minecraft has, except Garry's Mod goes the extra mile. With much better graphics, addons that go out off this world, and so much crap, no wonder Garry's Mod is rated the #1 physics sandbox ever, and in MY opinion, the #1 sandbox game EVER! P.S. I wish for some one to make a Mining/Crafting addon. Minecraft is a great game, I love it, but garrys mod is a bit more my taste and would like to put a little bit of minecraft into this amazing sandbox (No offense to MC pros and Fanatics, I just kinda like this more)
Trey;-;A very fun game to play with a group of friends, sometimes the download of content in a server can take alittle to long but overall really cool and fun games :) 8.5 Out of 10

Pyromancer;-;Garry's Mod is a sandbox. Quite a good one, at that. The base game is playable, and you can spend hours making awesome creations. Playing with friends is always fun, due to the sandbox nature of the game. In my opinion, the game really shines in it's server freedom, gamemodes and lastly addons. The HL2 weapons will bore you after a while, and the steam workshop intergration will make it alot easier to get SWEPs, models, NPCS, useful tools, useless garbage like sound guns (who the christ actually likes them) and things like that. There are many gamemodes to choose from, from standard sandbox, to TTT, a gamemode where people have to use their cunning to win/survive/rdm/ect. To even mods like ZMod that are completely different to the normal Garry's Mod experience, that pits Players against themselves and zombies while they fight over loot and land. Servers can choose between any of these gamemodes, and many, MANY more. And the best thing is that they can add to the gamemodes as much as they want, and they can even earn a suprisingly large amount of money from it, if the server is liked enough. Overall, my hours should tell you that I really like this game. Do yourself a solid, and buy this. Make sure to buy/own Counter Strike: Source for the content, as CSS is needed for many things. Anyway, to wrap up, Garry's Mod is a fantastic game.

{T$$M}Cultureddesert;-;THIS IS THE BEST SANDBOX GAME EVA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Alex;-;Hi, This is my review for Gary's Mod and i think this is a great game and i do recommend this game. There is no campaign or anything but there are gamemodes on multiplayer and on single player you can play sandbox. You can play sandbox by yourself or with friends. There are so many things and people are posting stuff in the workshop everyday so it is almost and infinite amount of things that you could do. I do not think that this game will ever bore you because it always brings laughs and has almost endless things to do. So i think it is worth the money that you pay.

THEBESTPICKLE2;-;7This game is one of the best games i have ever played and have owned
TheCaptainkitten;-;Garrys mod. The best of the best when it comes to sandbox building games. Garrys mod includes a variety of game modes from Trouble in Terrorist town( which is like a find the murderer and dont die type of gam) to role playing) were you pick a job and live the life as if you were that one). With the inclusion of the steam workshop it is even easier to get great addons for your sandbox world. Although it is a great game there are some things to consider before getting, if oyu are on a slow computer it might lag and that will make it hard to play, also servers take a while to load (depending on the mode of choice) and you need to get a few games like Counterstrike, Team fortress 2, and Left for Dead 2 to get some textures unless you want to download them piece by piece. But in all seriousness this game is amazing to have a good laugh with your friends and the gamming community is really friendly for the most part.

Hope you have fun with the game :D I've put over 800 hours into it xD

DULITY;-;Okay, there are many pros and cons to Garry's Mod, with the cons, in my opinion, FAR outweighing the pros. However, this could be biased, as my rig isn't EXACTLY the best around, but despite the huge amount of negativity that may or may not be present here m80s, it really all comes down to what you enjoy the most out of a videogame, and since this is a multiplayer sandbox-type game... chances are, you're probably going to like it, one way or the other. So.. let's get started shall we? Like I said, Garry's Mod is a single player/multiplayer sandbox game that allows you to do just about anything (provided you know how to code in LUA--although not really needed to enjoy the game--and have an outstanding amount of patience. I'll get into this eventually) and features many gamemodes that are sure to provide you with hours of fun (TTT, I'm looking at you <3). Along with gamemodes, Garry's Mod has a huge modding community. The Steam Community Workshop provides some pretty in' great addons for you to use in your creations or for your amusement in singleplayer. Of course, this is where  gets real and damnright annoying. Alright, if you've read this far you'll know I mentioned something along the lines of "LUA". That, my friend, is the game's coding language. Just about every addon (such as custom weapons, vehicles and generally any script that is supposed to make anything happen, really) is coded using LUA. And boy is it tedious to get more than 60 addons working. The thing that bugs me the most out of this is that most mod authors don't tell you what other addons their mods are compatible with, which results in LUA Errors that will eventually lead to you losing your precious sanity. Seriously, I lost count of the many times I've crashed because of too many addons or memory loss (the memory loss is my fault, really. Yay 32-bit windows) So getting over 60 addons is tedious, right. Now on to the community. Huge modding community, sure, but the online community is ing TERRIBLE. All i'm going to tell you is that you should make use of the mute button whenever possible. I see too many players online pointlessly complaining about someone's voice when they could just make use of the mute button. I know that most of the time these guys know there is a way to mute people, but some people genuinely don't and i've no clue as to why. All in all, it's not that bad of a game if you can manage to ignore these problems that, for some reason, have not been looked into yet. in' Garry, man.

jojodud;-;This is one of my favorite games. You can do anything that you think you can and can't do in normal videogames. A fun sandbox mode wich is really fun you can download add-ons and gamemodes. Wich really makes the game but you can link source games to make thing from that. Its really just a fun game i could not find a bad review. There are bugs and glitches but minor things.
SUPERPOLSTER;-;this game..... - Anonymous
Myrage Anne;-;Very fun! You can do anything from making a scene to making a zombie invasion! Or a roket! The posibilities are endless. I definitally recommend this game. It's perfect for people who just want to do their own thing. You can play single player or multiplayer, wich is AWESOME! I aspecially like the fact that you can make your own stuff and then put it on the workshop for other people to see and use. Going on servers though, that's a pain. You need to download the stuff that's in the server. So it could take HOURS for you to go into a server. But if you have the stuff, then it doesn't take long (depending on your connection.). MANY, I reapeat, MANY things can go wrong. By that I mean: Glitches, crashes, and freezing. Depending on how good your computer is, you can only do so much. If, for example, you wanted a zombie infested map, you'd have to have a good gaming computer. Otherwize your computer will lag, freeze or even crash. I'm not saying this game isn't bad at all. I'm just pointing out some stuff that could be worked on. Other then that, this game is AWESOME! I love it, my sister loves it, my dad loves it, my friends love it. It's a very lovable game. :) :) :) Ten out of ten, I'd say.

(FP-SU) littleirishman;-;So many choices, lots of gamemodes!
*:HurricaneJinx*:;-;I think garry's mod is a great game its fun and everything but what should be said is that cs:s (counter strike source) is what most of the maps are other wise you will see purple and black blocks everywhere because of this message not said to me earlier i had to pay 16 instead of 13 Thats a big difference since i could have either saved the money or brought another game i think its a waste to be done like that so either garrys mod should put my message in caps and have a warning message before the purchase or to simply make garrys mod 13 and it should also come with cs:s and not to let you buy garry's mod on its own.
-jennaroo;-;Really good gamemodes, like Prophunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town, et cetera. Worth the ten dollars.
AYY LMAO;-;Entertainment fulfilled.
stratosmann;-;this game is a must-have for those who seek creativity and ideas.........
Dogman15;-;You shouldn't have to own Counter-Strike: Source to complete some of the missing content in this game. Well, the missing content in certain servers that use CS:S assets on their maps.
Bawlz;-;My boyfriend shot me. 10/10
Chef Geoffrey Excellence;-;Have you ever wanted to build a gaint spaceship that when launching you realise doesn't work and actually kills anyone nearby in a burst of fire and death? Or create a giant mechanically working automobile to crush your foes? Or maybe even make a drivable bath tub?! All this and more are possible in GMOD, i have had the game for over a year now and i need to tell the people, this game is brilliant, one minute you can be flinging toasters at the combine, the next making a detailed TF2 scene, and this is all before you get addons, the addon workshop has everything from hilarious weapons to Hitler, you can make quite literally anything you want. Who wouldn't want this game?! You can create a controlled zombie outbreak and then die by the power of a melon falling on you, must buy for any gamer. 10.32224678543319472 / 10

JONATHAN;-;Great and well thought out game good job dude on this game
Dragon's patience;-;It's a grat game to be sure but it does have it's flaws. E.g It dosen't tell you that you need to have the couter-strike: source texture pack to play games without having a errors signs and purple and blcak squares showing up. You can buy a bundle where you can get these both for a discount but it isn't clear that you need the textures until you're playing a game with giant "error" as a table. Plus it feels like you were scammed when you find out. You can get them from free online but if you don't trust the web I recommend just buying counter-strike: source (which costs more than the actual game...). But it is a great game beside that with plenty of different game modes along with some role playing games. The games are unique, like prop hunt when you would turn into a object as a hider and hide, while th hunters would try and find you and shoot you and your team down. Overall it's agreat game but it does have a few tricks up it's sleve.
InstinctX8;-;As an animator, I highly recommend buying this game because it has everything that is required to exercise your imagination. Furthermore, this game is basically 30+ games because of the different game modes available within GMod. You get more than what you pay for. The addons available in this game is the heart and soul of GMod because it is what enables players to further expand their sense of adventure and curiosity. Be aware, it is necessary to have Counter-Strike: Source to fully experience this game without any frustrations regarding world textures and models. The fun factor of this game whether you are playing with friends or alone, offline or online will always remain.
TheDisciple;-;Best. Game. Ever. It offers any person, anything they want. If they're looking for action, Zombie Survival. If there looking for a Crime Simulation (with most likely a pretty hilarious atmosphere) Trouble in Terrorist Town, and the list goes on and on! This highly expansive game really takes the sky and goes to the heavens. It is a gift. 10/10
BigLou;-;Best MMO ife ever played!!!
The Booty Snatcher;-;good game if you have time to put into it,i have way to much time to put into it 10/10 so many ways to play the game so many types of game modes for multiplayer to!
pjdino926;-;This game is tons of fun with endless gamemodes. Each gamemode i played for hours on in and this game is defiently one of my favorite. So if you have money and time you should get this game.
UH.;-;need to learn how to navigate the menu, HAHHA
Anarchist;-;I would highly recommend this sandbox game because of how it lets you make your own fun experience in sandbox. You could spawn a bunch of Father Grigoris and zombies to watch them fight in a classic survivor versus zombie match. You could even spawn a hunter chopper and have an epic rocket launcher match on top of the roofs. Overall it is best for those who would want a game where you have control over pretty much everything. Garry is the best!!! :3

However, one thing that caught my eye; Pigeons. There's nothing better than having an unlimited amount of pigeons at hand to practice and perfect your shooting skills, without being reported by your neighbours. 11/10 would shoot again.

SaintVarlik;-;I've had Garry's Mod since GM9 came out, and I've had hours upon hours of fun with it. It can be a springboard for creativity - a look at the Facepunch Games forums, or any Source movie created before the advent of Valve's SFM will make that clear. But, I've found that you MUST HAVE A PLAN when you sit down to play. Plan to play multiplayer. Plan to build an airship. Plan to program a missile launcher in WireMod. Heck, you can teach yourself about the applications of vector calculus using WireMod. But if you stumble into the sandbox with no plan at all, you WILL waste vast amounts of time before you do anything really satisfying. Explore the goofiness and the mods for a few hours, but if you're like me, a plan will help you get a lot more out of Gmod in the end. Play something with a narrative if you want to goof off. Garry's Mod is hard - and potentially rewarding - work. :)

Zilla;-;It's ok I guess
2001pedro;-;The best sandbox you can buy. Pros First and foremost, Steam Workshop. The things people make for gmod are insane. Graphics. It's a source mod. The graphics on source games tend to be decent. Multiplayer. Multiplayer gamemodes (all playermade) are one of the best parts of gmod. It's a sandbox. Spawn whatever you want, pose anything however you want attach a rocket thruster to a bathtub and launch a citizen into space. Maps. If you have a source game. Almost all source games can be basically attached to gmod. So you can play the maps, use the props, spawn the characters, etc. Infinite possibilities! Play, spawn, pose, do anything! Cons Now, even a game as perfect as gmod must have downsides right? Children tend to be ridiculed a bit in multiplayer. All the annoying kids give the decent ones a bad name. I should know... T-T As with any game. If you mod it too much, it will crash. It runs slightly worse than alot of source games. But if you can run CSS you can probably run GMOD. Final score: 99/100
PowerPanda;-;The amount you can do on this game, theres no point in not having it, theres no excuse, if ur using steam, ur pc will run it, theres bound to be a gamemode you will enjoy even if ur not into the normal sandbox, you will never get bored with the amound of addon there is, going up every minute, and the amount of gamemodes Just buy it
<<BlackShadow>>"DarkSaiyan;-;Bored? Have Fun with Garry's Mod!
[MYS]Pierre;-;Hmm Overall is quiet good When I hosting a server why people will get dropped after joining my server please help
Caitlynn-Rawrs;-;If you like getting rammed by twelve year olds who like to use  shaped weapons and have absolutely the smallest vocabulary Check out garrys mod it has it all!
MLG Grandpa;-;cool game
VinVigo;-;If you like fighting zombies, building robots, creating animations, Or just plain fooling around, this game is for you. The things you can do are endless thanks to the workshop. It is perfect for creating animations. I'm for it all the way. Totally worth $10.

BOOOOMSHAKALAKA;-;i was a banana.. in prophunt
Monsieur Yan Yan (puffy);-;I think this game is fun to play, although it is so damn laggy but im ok with. The only mods i tried are Trouble In Terroris Town and Prop Hunt. Some people say the building mod is also fun but i have never tried it. The thing i hate is when i try to play with my friends Gmod DayZ, the map is always full because ther is only one server. Also when i join some games it takes at leat 15 minutes to go in the game so thats kinda . Although it is laggy i still enjoy playing it.
John Kramer;-;this game is one of the best
DarkShadow699;-;best game ever you can destroy a melon 10/10

Carlos Bastardo;-;Very very fun, a few bugs but still awesome :P recommend for anyone who wants to have alot of fun and do whatever :)
Jikantaru;-;If someone want's hours of Fun, then buy this game.!
Dr. Professor;-;A Game Built around Creativity and the wickedly popular Source Engine Classics such as Half-Life 2 and Counter Strike: Source. This game allows you to take the role of the maker. While other games of this engine allow you to point and shoot. You may point, and build. I have had my fun and money's worth 100 fold at least. For this game has brought me over a thousand hours of fun with friends that I can not comprehend otherwise. I do recommend this Game. To any and all. To those who wish to have fun with a Great Community of builders, role-player's, and FPS Shooters. Explore the server browser with hundreds of player integrated gamemodes, whether your style is FPS, which can be found in TTT. Or some Serious and Non-Serious Roleplay: CW:HL2RP, DarkRP. Whatever your taste and Style Garry's Mod has something for you. Gameplay: 10/10 Graphics: 9.9/10 Community: 8.725/10 Replayability: 10/10 Unfortunately this game is on a downward turn. As the masses and communities start to smallen. So does the Game Itself. As it fades into the mists of time, let us remember what great times we have had. That is all from me. I hope this Helps.
Berserkinggear;-;Garry's Mod a game that cannot be given a serious review like my other reviews. Just look at the screenshots for the game a fun, interesting and wacky game full of the most random things in a video game for instance you can make Batman twerk not joking twerk! Garry's Mod 100/10 If you don't own this on steam then, why do you have steam. BTW play with friends gets boring in singleplayer easily!
Dr Feelgood;-;Despite its bugs with multiplayer and annoying community, this is still a great sandbox game with endless creative possibility. Gmans face is hilarious to mess about with btw.
Wyatt11899;-;Great fun, hilarious to play with friends... IF I HAD ONE!
Jeff The Killer;-;There is a bug I found in my game for Garry's mod that I think should be fixed. It is that my addons some of them are gone and some maps to. I also can't download them again and I can't download any new ones if anyone else is having this problem then steam can you fix this problem. But if you have the same problem tell me about it.
Holy Diver;-;game admins here are ing butthurt as .
Bob;-;You can make giant  which follow people (   ) 10/10
The Punjab Slayer;-;I Have bought alot of games on steam garrys mod is byfar my favourite one and i have cod and battlefield and assassins creed nothing comes close to garrys mod multi player I dont play sand box but i play multiplayer and if your thinking of getting this game GET THIS ING GAME
SimplyMaxed;-;I recommend this game by alot! I also recommend a GameMode that you should try out. It is called "DarkRP" Standing for "Dark Roleplay". There are many servers out there with alot of different mod set and  who constantly kill you OVER AND OVER AGAIN but soon you learn how to get them in trouble or banned. I recommend it. There is alot to do with this Game and the GameMode!
MooseMan;-;Garry's Mod is the most fun game i have ever played. The unlimited potential for anything you can possibly imagine is amazing! I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME BUT GET COUNTER STRIKE SOURCE TOO FOR NO MISSING TEXTURES.
mhhh ok;-;this game is my favorite game eva!
L1Z4RD SQUAD LEADER;-;I Relly like this game it is a fun game i recommend every budy that plays steam should have and play this game
Zakkychan007;-;this game is very game
bdizz1e;-;Love this game so many hours spent on this!
MEME DREAM CREAM;-;This game honestly is so stiff. You cant mod it, theres like no guns and apparently porn sprays arent allowed. Like wdf, am I the only one? 4/57 only buy if not on sale so valve gets more money for a game that isnt a mod.
XxGamerGuy_21xX;-;Love it. So fun. A little laggy and screen errors can be annoying, not easy to play on a Mac latop, but still great. Love Nanners <3
Miss Lyrical;-;i absolutly love this game, def a need to have game
Wonkzar;-;I don't know if this is a mod (and for waht) or a game, but I do know it's awesome
[FLICK];-;Garry's mod was the game that i realy wanted to play when i was like 12 years old. I Loved this game due to the Creative building, Maps, Addons and mostly Multiplayer. This game already hits an apple. - Stevenisadork
koalaballa;-;ruined my life and caused me to never fully trust any of my friends 10/10
Arckaden;-;Very good game! Various things to do. You can play by yourself or go play online gamemodes. There is lots of fun gamemodes ones where you can freeroam or play by an objective.
ghostman587;-;its awsome and you can do whatever you feel like
SnowHippoz;-;So many different gamemodes that you can spend many many hours in each one! Worth WAY more than the price.

asdPlayer2;-;The best game for making pictures or making videos. The best game for just goofing off and having fun, or just spawn enemies and fight them off.
A real life housecat;-;Awesome game. I find this game beautifully made by our friend here, Garry. I'm happy it was brought to steam. :) Oh, yeah! There is one more thing... MEOW :3
Tenryuu;-;This is hardly a game to be trifled with. Bucket of Clams out of 10.
kostaskiller5;-;Great game but after some time playing it if you dont do or learn how to do something diffrent on it you might get bored with it. Also it is again a bit boring if you dont have a new computer so you can't download new maps or mods for the game. Anyway, it is a great game. 9/10
ZombieslayR;-;An Insanely good game that I have wasted 245.0 Hours of my life playing! With new features being added regularily the game will never stop suprising you with its new features! Additionally its a REAL sandbox game!
HAZE;-;If you're looking for a game that allows you to ride a baby to space, then look no further because Garr's Mod has it all! From making a funny freeze frame with ragdolls to building a spy cam to sneak into peoples bases undetecded, there is anostly NOTHING you can't do in GMOD. It puts the player into a varitey of maps with all the tools you need for chaos, if you want to build a giant rocket and strap a dinosaur to it then GO NUTS. If there is one thing I would have to say about this it would be "The only limit, is your imagination", whatever you think of doing I can almost garuntee that you it can be done.
cosby714;-;Now..where do I begin? This game is more like a few hundered games in one. There are so many game modes to play there's no way I can talk about them all, so I'll just talk about the two most popular gamemodes, sandbox and TTT. Sandbox: You can load up any map you want, then spawn in and mess around with various props, NPC's, vehicles, and weapons. With the addon system, you can spawn in a crazy amount of stuff created by other players. Will you build a giant castle out of plastic blocks? Or will you spawn in an army of rebels to fight a combine horde? Your choice. Trouble in terrorist town: Essentially a murder mystery game. You're the terrorists from counter-strike, but someone's a traitor among you, but you don't know who. It's the innocent's job to find out who the traitor is and kill him before he kills everyone else. You could randomly kill people (not a good idea) or you could use evidence to find the traitors and exterminate them.
Potato Chicken;-;10/10 would play again killed a guy on accident as traitor in trouble in terrorist town with a explosive barrel to the face which someone shot XD
Ixawk;-;Garrys Mod is bassicly a mass multiplayer sandbox where the sky is the limit. Who cares if this game is on sale or not just get it already, by the time you realise that you are reading a pointless review you could have been playing garrys mod. What are you waiting for? Get the game! Come on all you have to do is press the buy button... Aaaaany time now..... Come on you know you want to... Oh come on just ge the game!
Suvivior;-;Be a GOD spawn enything do enything... unless you incounter some flying, crossbow, admin well the your ED 9/10 "dont think just buy it you wont regret it"
<font face="Segoe Script">Adieu;-;awesome. Fantastic.
Goodle;-;I have too much to say, too lazy to write everything down so um... 10/10 Best game on here.
Akeyume;-;This game is so customizable. free roam, a variety of evergrowing addons, and multiplayer!!! i give this game 5 stars! (funny glitches too) :3
Laser;-;Great for having fun with your friends and exploring the features
perrys722;-;this game is awesome i love this game its good to play multiplayer on but you can also just make a server and have a great time.
failurenugget;-;This game is a game
JealousMoose;-;The most entertaining game that exists in my opintion!
Joseph the Jihadist;-;This game is great,its basically a mod which has mods in it,EVERYTHING,and i mean EVERYTHING,is possible(with the right skills of scripting,ETC.) the community is great if you are not playing with 6 years old children,workshop can handle giving you addons more easily,this game is great with friends and even better with more friends.i highly recommend this game,10/10 must have. Also,beware,alot of perverted little kids started uploading "Sex" addons,with titles like "Zomg,BEWBZ" or "HOT FURRY READY FOR DOGGY STYLE" or "SEXEH PONY PINKI PHUIE WANTS SEX"if you see any of those,do everyone a favor and downvote and report them to have them removed,they do not belong on the game. that's the only downside of the workshop i guess,but except for that,you should buy it.
HighCommanderXen;-;Very fun,good to do vids on.
Alpaca Appreciator;-;You   up with whatever you feel like. One day you're building a flying portable bathroom with a spike ram, the next day you're raining down nukes onto the endless hordes of Wheatlies you spawned out of boredom. Then when you think you've do ne everything, you find a Star Destroyer and run into a building chucking combustable lemons Plus it's one of the games you HAVE to get on steam or you have a sad life

Wiggle The Anne Frank;-;I enjoy this game on all platforms, weather it's killing off terrorists, or making flying boats, this is the best game I have ever played!
Inues;-;Best game ever. If you don't have this in your cache of games then I feel bad for you.
Warlord Wackeh;-;This game is one of the most realistic sandbox game ever! The physics in this game will make you question life. Depending on what gamemode you'll play or play, but this game is truly made for anyone, gamemodes such as Clockwork, or DarkRp, Trouble in Terrorist Town, they're all fun, but if you don't want to listen to squeakers play Clockwork, or TTT.
Blanky Man;-;Awesome. Custom gamemodes can be extremely fun.
[VD:PM:]TheSoapyPotato;-;Dis some cool
Tyroan;-;Great game life has already been lost.

Rock man;-;If this game was a person they would be full  and require constant attention.
Shamus Wong;-;Garry's Mod. This game, This game man This game has given me some of the best times i've ever had in a video game. And personally, i couldnt recommend it any more. The good: Amazingly entertaining Dope physics Great variety of game modes Mostly good communtiy Darkrp is awesome Lively community Some really nice textures in some places I can't think of much else, it's to good! The Bad: Some annoying kids on TTT or Darkrp servers Some server conntections Can't think of anything else, It's to good! I honestly couldn't recommend this game anymore than i already have. This is one of the best games i own 95/100

Dillon;-;Really good so much fun
bunkley;-;Favorite game of teh sandbox's other than minecraft TAKE BACK THE LEMONS CAVE JOHNSON
ValenteAlvarez;-;What can I say... the sky's the limit. If you enjoy games that literally let you do anything you want (not that I know many which do), then this is for you. I've barely spent 25+ hours, but I think that's enough to tell that I haven't even scratched the surface of what you can do here. 10/10
Jamega;-;Best. Game. Ever! You can create a awesome house with your friends, or have a Deathmatch. When you're bored of that, you can go to a Prop Hunt server or do some Roleplay. Then, have a good ol' fashioned showdown on a Hunger Games server. At the end of the day, Test out one of the thousands of Mods create by other people by yourself or on your LAN network with a friend. Highly Recommended.
Fireflame59 [TRADING CHIVALRY];-;This game is custom and should be played 4 fun but dont be afraid to show skillz
I Didn't Choose The Gabe Life;-;The best  sandbox game in the world. It is more better than cheese breadsticks, and cheese breadsticks are awesome.

YA BOY PACMAN;-;If you play Call of DUty and are tired of getting quickscoped nad having your mom get ed by 8 year olds, this is the game for you! Not only will you have fun but you will not get quickscoped or get your mother ed every 10 minutes by 8 year old children! All in all its ing winning! -Charlie Sheen
BabyPuncher;-;I liked that you can basically do whatever you want. Lol

Kimchi;-;Buffet with just a bunch of great food, but like all buffets it suffers from too many chubby whiny kids.
Mr.Bankston;-;The Gmod community is huge, approaching the likes of L4D2, Portal 2, or even getting to the stage of Team Fortress 2 (At least if it weren't FtP). This means new servers, new addons, new workshop creations, all new each day. It is never the same game twice, unless you choose it to be of course. It is possible to mount games on Gmod, so long as they run on the Source engine. Even so, this means your content from The Half Life games (Source), Portal and L4D series, Team Fortress 2 and many other games are all able to be mounted from the word go. And, arguably the best thing about Gmod, is the fact that you can do ANYTHING. Not like most 'realistic' first person shooters which say "Hop on your bike. You can go anywhere you like! (So long as it's in this general direction.)" No. If you can think of it, then it can be made. And yes, there are some pretty crazy things out there, but that makes it all the more fun. 10/10
NYankee222;-;Simply great. Kudos to Garry Newman for making this game. You can build, you can create cars, the list is endless! Buy this game if you are looking for a simulation of ANYTHING YOU WANT! :D
Mr Lister the Sister Fister;-;second to call of duty 0/10 complete rip off
spocot;-;Awesome game, especially with the wide range of game modes and server. Would recommend to all.

Just Classical;-;In my 1,500+ hours playing this game.... What, 1,500+ hours! This game is good enough to play for 1,500 hours. 10/10
Tsunmikitty;-;When I first bought the game I joined my friends on a server, instantly found a toilet to spawn in and promptly killed both of them using said toilet. The toilet hit one of my friends at such a high velocity that it shot his dead body into my other friend and killed him too. 10/10 great for killing time and friends.
Fennekin;-;This game is one of those "must have" games! You are bound to no rules, and do whatever you please. You can play as diffrent models such as....Lucario....or Cell from Portal and Portal 2. This game has sandbox mode to make funny pictures or videos. There is also diffrent modes to this game, like "Stop it, Slender!" All I can say is that one of the best games, and you could maybe recreate one of those games like "Left 4 Dead 2"
chad;-;I do like this game. You can do so much stuff in game. SUprised they don't charge more for this wonderful piece of art.
MonsterHunter;-;It is an incredibly amazing game. It has a combination of fun and just plain hilarity
[RG] xxcr4zyxxx;-;So boss!!!!!!!
Pembury;-;Such a great game, you can spend countless hours on here, with GMOD13 it now uses steam workshop so new game-modes, items, and tools and be downloaded and installed in an instant. With server mods you can go from playing the sandbox style to playing a completely different genre.
~LilKitt~;-;I could live on this game forever with all the mods and all the stuff you could build all the gamodes you can play all that stuff i really love this game so glad i finally bought it
Ferdinand The Bold;-;Garry's Mod is an extremely fun game with many gamemodes, including a sandbox gamemode for horsing around! I love it and play it everyday! :D
Generl Polkvnik Kaye;-;It is a fantastic game, with very much addons and creativity, I mean, sandbox games usually are creative. But it's great, I go on a bunch of the different game-modes, I mean, yeah, there are some missing textures. It is a downfall that you have to own some games to see the right content, yeah, but it's great never-the-less! I reccommend this game, and I have no regrets owning it.
Riot Gains;-;You can make bathtubs into airplanes and airplanes into bathtubs 4.20/5
Some Guy;-;Such a fun game, where you can literally do anything you want. Only problem is you can't make servers for you and friends very easily, but there's enough empty servers.
[BKB] Sir_Mr_Bman;-;This is one of the best games I have ever played. A must-have for anyone that has a "Source" game.
Guy Fieri;-;There is so much to do
Vygan;-;Everyone can create something with this, how ugly or how beautiful it is, it can fly, it can dance, it can make you a famous guy on YT, etc. This game can make everything out of you, and you of him. I can say a lot more to this game, but you probably already own it and are expecting a funny review out of here. Well, scroll further. AND IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS, have a nice day and throw that PC out.

Cat;-;dis game is for the swaggy people of swag town only cool kids can play
Zach the Man;-;Ruined my life. 10/10.
Omg A Puppy <3;-;Gmod is the Lego of video games
mhuggins5;-;this game is great fir children t least above ten and has a limitless amount of imagination and fun, just like Minecraft!
zephar;-;This guarentees some good ol' days where you can attach rocket proelling soda cans to the bottom of chairs and call it a rocket.
Webster;-;Ruined my life
Wingnut;-;If you like building out your dreams and ideas, well this is the game for you.... you can do just about anything!
jtv15;-;Practice for disciplining your children some day.
DatFruitBat AP;-;If you don't have Garry's mod, and you're not installing it right now, then you may have a problem.
Black_cat12;-;this game is very fun but with out addons it can get boring and there is a lack of some realy useful addons that i have found a few i could think of would be like a parashoot addon
Black_cat12;-;this game is very fun but with out addons it can get boring and there is a lack of some realy useful addons that i have found a few i could think of would be like a parashoot addon
PAPUVA :~DD;-;It's okay i guess... - 10/10.
Ej's;-;Morbus, Zmod, TTT, PiratesShipWar.
Argumentative cat;-;This game is probably the greatest sandbox game i have ever played. There are ocasional glitches, such as EVERYTHING TO DO WITH SLIDERS or how i sometimes have to download addons i already have to join a server... If you like sandbox games you should definitly give this a try.
BadSniper;-;You can do a thing. You can do a lot of things. You can blow up that thing. Any thing.
L KRAKE;-;One of the most fun games
JUST DO IT;-;Their is endless possibilities to Garry's Mod. You can do anything your imagination takes you. Many servers to play on aswell gamemodes. Garry's Mod is great besides the fact how many immature people play it and just simply act stupid.
Boardlockmango;-;This has got to be the best Sandbox game I have ever played! There is soo much to do with unlimited additional content. It's even better if you have friends to play with. 10/10
Inanity_-_;-;Turned into a  in prophunt. Hung a body on a tower in TTT. Was a hooker in DarkRP.
Liquidum;-;You can make A banana flip off a car.
Jew hating TransNiigger cuntbag;-;great game, there is practicly no limits to the game. you can do every thing for shoot people to create machines, and if you're into programing and creating custom content it is verry easy to make maps, weppons, vehicals etc. i my self took up on makeing custom content and have made numerus maps and have just sarted to learn scripting. i highly reccomend this game, and its an even better game if you're creative.
Macatosh;-;Garry's Mod is a very brilliant and fun game to make memories and adventures on! It really accomplished the "Sandbox" feel to it with its wide varity of creations! Overall a Fun and Hilarious game!
pppp;-;This game, played over 1800hrs on it, is such a blast. Community is so big almost everyday you find a new thing to do, extensive addons such as wiremod will change the way of your building making everything much cleaner. I'd give it a 10/10, 11/10 if you have friends to play with. Exiting gamemodes such as DarkRP, TTT, Murder and hundreds more. Create your own house on sandbox, roleplay as a job (such as Gundealer or police), be a zombie (zombieRP) and make movies! Everyone should have the game. For the price given, I personally recommend it.Just be sure to have a source engine game so no missing textures. I recommend CS:S and HL2 or HL2:DM.
Cody;-;Great multiplayer fun.
Dead;-;Full of autism and retardation
my meme is 404.;-;Amazing game played it for like 10 hours straight when i got it. 10/10 oh and get friends to play with you on Sandbox. You're Welcom. ;3
Nyderis;-;I got Yoda to pick up a sniper rifle 11/10. But seriously this game is amazing. There are thousands of mods and servers. From Trouble In Terrorist Town, to Prop Hunt, and more! You can literally do anything in this game! Build vehicles, make cool contraptions, test your accuracy with zombies or citizens, build rollercoasters, build a house, and more! It's even more enjoyable with friends! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes mods, building, sandbox games, and such!
Theika.;-;It's okay, but you can't really do much unless you mod it or use the workshop. If you play I recommend Prophunt and Trouble in Terrorist Town. (TTT)
Dr. Zippo (BatCake Jr);-;Became a "Hobo Wizard" on DarkRp and Forced People to give me RP Money. 10/10 Would Do Again.
zdoney;-;There is literally no end to what you can do in this game. Feel like battling the Daleks for control of the TARDIS? There are mods for that. Want the U.S. and Soviet Russia to fight a war? Try the Military SNPCs. Want to explore space and accidentally cause the end of the universe? Download the Spacebuild: Omen map. Wanna stab someone in the back... Literally? How about the Murder Gamemode? Game is worth $50, but you get it for 10.
SneakyWacky;-;this game is good in mutiplayer and all the diffrent game mods, but if you play normal g-mod it is bad
IRAQ LOBSTER;-;GOOD GAME u can do what the  u like!!! TTT sandbox PROBHUNT THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME I AM GOING TO EXPLDE....
NakedSandvich;-;It's a masterpiece, everything was beautifully put together and overall it is the best video game ever. But there are too many mods. 7.8/10
Trystonperry11;-;A necessity for every Steam account.
PolarSound;-;It is really fun if u have allot of friends to play with. also with the addons and gamemodes its allot more fun
Dingus Fingus;-;tHIS is a good game (LOL doing this for acheivement)
Vanilla;-;For only $10, its pretty much a why not type of game. This game offers endless hours of entertainment and is filled of TONS of content. I would recommend this game to any steam user, especially those who are new to steam. I rate this game 10/10. Especially for how much it offers :)
TMoney $;-;An amazing game! Fun with friends and gets better with addons! I would highly recommend it!

Bingo Bango;-;Good fun with friends.
[OT} kaiderbyshire.kd;-;its a really good but on thing my gmod spawn menu doesnt do anything i cant change player models cant spawn anything in the whole game does anyone know how to help i do not have a wireless mouse
iQuiCkZ;-;Having over 200+ hours on Gmod, I think I can write a truth-full review: This game is really fun, you can do just about anything! In single player (based on the things you add to Gmod from the workshop) you can: Shoot your guns like the 9mm pistol, a 6 shot revolver, a triggered bomb/laser mine bomb, a gravity gun, and then your tools you use to build, the tool gun, and the laser mover thingy But you can add more weapons like a AK-47, C4, Colt 44, and other great guns! On multiplayer you can get mods ( duh, of corse :P ) Like Prop hunt (prop hunt is a game where you can be whatever prop you want, and you have to try to hide from the hunters, the hunters try to find all the props before time runs out!) Murder (Murder is a mod where you have bystanders, and 1 bystander will have a secret weapon, then there is a murder, the murders role is to kill every one without getting shot, by the bystander with his secret weapon!) Hide & Seek (Hide & Seek is a mod where they are hiders and seekers, the hiders hide from the seekers seeking :P the seekers role is to find all the hiders before time runs out!) And other great mods, but those are the ones I play often! 415612435452435245/5 - IGN Now please thumbs this review up it took a long time to type :D
chiefagent007;-;11/10 Would get banned again
MikeTheGamer-That MLG Though!;-;Its awesome!! you can build,buy skins everything!
whovian137();-;Brilliantly made game, but laggy sometimes.
SullenPl0x;-;This game is well worth it. The main highlight of this game is 100% the multiplayer. This game does not stop itself at one genre. It can be a strategy game, a first person shooter, a sandbox game, ect. Garrys Mod is like that one friend of the other friend. That you met because of the other friend, yet you still think this friend is better, so you stay with this friend. Garrys Mod is this friend. I give this game a 9/10, and have never had any problems with it.
NocturnaL;-;I R8 8/8 GR8 B8 M8 NO H8 M8
Heisenberg;-;This is a great sandbox game. I highly recomend it and you will definitely get plenty of laughs out of it.
Sir Cheeso;-;i thing gmod is an awesome creativity game i think its a game that inspires people to build discover and create so i would rate it 9 and a half out of ten
army1green;-;People think it is stupid so they dont buy it they dont know what they are missing out on this game is epic
Deadslime72;-;Do anything and  and .
Paperboy;-;Rope people into a car and run over your friends Give this game a HL3/HL2
TeZieh;-;The Roleplaying Will Ruin Your Life.
Goravore The Ruin Walker;-;very creative if you have a creative mind this is the game for you lots of wacky  too great job garry cannot wait for garrys mod 14!!!!!!!!! if there will be one
[] TheTopHatter;-;Thing about this game is, its not Gmod, its HL3...its been here for years and we fools have not noticed! TTT is a must and if you want to fling lifeless bodys around against a cold void grass land well be my guest. 10/10 ign (   )
[Elite]kingsjester92;-;This is a great game!
Brandors;-;Garry's Mod is a very, very creative game. I killed some of my best friends in the weirdest, most outrageous ways immaginable (I see it as a bonding moment). If you don't have this game, GET THIS F**KING GAME! You'll have the best time of your life!
[MAG] Hoffy;-;My stress release
MoHouS | S;-;this mod of garry 11/10 must play
Severus Snape;-;Wow... words cannot explain how good this game is... just... get this game. There is no purpose to it. None. Zero. Blank. It is one of the best games ever, in my opinion, just, download 10 GBS OF FRICKIN ADDONS AND THE DO SOMETHING IN IT. Just, do whatever you want in this game. 9999999999999999999999999999999/10. :gmod: :gmod: :gmod:
AChocolateMilkshake;-;YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING (not everything but mot things)!!!! you can buy this game and play other games that you would need to pay for!
BigLaughz;-;Great game, i love it there are SO many game modes to choose from it's insane
Banana;-;All your creative potential in just 1 game, awesome.
Joshua-AZ;-;yes i recommend GMOD all fo the players out there its a real run game and i know i have fun on it
Rix;-;This game was worth the money! This game is full of comedy and fun. You can as well get addons. I have noticed no bugs just yet from my point of view. I honestly think this game was the best $9.99 selling game yet! I reccomend buying this comedy like game. As well you can get addons and thats the best part! You can get a Five Nights at Freddy's map, models, or npc's. That's all, and I do reccomend buying this game :)
Cybercube82;-;Garry's Mod is a great game. I love that you have more freedom in it, as opposed to other games I have played. I have recommended it to others and they bought it.
lewi;-;Played on a server with my friend. General shenanigans ensue. Got kicked for mic spam-- mic wasn't on. 10/10.
xVictinii;-;I LOVE Garry's Mod a lot. By a lot, I mean A LOT!
Kenziewolf45;-;It wont let me spawn things but the other parts of the game is good love it just wish I could spawn thing and change my look so im not an old man. <3
Mr. White;-;It's the best assortment of mods that let you create things and make great animations. You should get it! :D
Niykee Boys;-;Ok so at the time that I am Writing this review I have done 111 Hours on Gmod. I love G mod it is the greatest game out there and I dont have as much hours on any other game then G mod if you are a new or veteran pc gamer G mod is for you with a great community I highly reccomend this game. If you need anymore explanation of why G mod is amazing then watch this video now! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAqt7dERWJs
Dr.BreadFish;-;These are my thoughts about this game [GRAPHICS] i could not complain their decent there are alot of options in the consle and video option on this game to change them so i would give graphics 9.5/10 [GAMEPLAY] there is a ton of things to do and i mean an endless amount of posibilities of things you can do there are over 50 gamemodes and personaly i do sandbox single player because i just like to make screen shots and share them with my friends n.n so i would give gameplay 10/10 [POSING RAGDOLLS} most of the time i kind of have a hard time trying to pose the tf2 and cs:s ragdolls because the body parts can be stiff sometimes and it messes everything up for me when making a screen shot so i would have to give Posing 5/10 sorry :/ [HUMOR] i would'n most of the time i kind of have a hard time trying to pose the tf2 and cs:s ragdolls because the body parts can be stiff sometimes and it messes everything up for me when making a screen shot so i would have to give Posing 5/10 sorry :/ [HUMOR] i would'nt say there is much humor in this game but when there is a 10 minute gmod mini movie i laugh my  off with all the references and effects and ragdolls so i would give humor 8.5/10 thats all i could come up with for now thank you for reading n.n
Derpy;-;I love this game very much. It's like a minecraft, except its not as pixelated as it is. The gamemode is a actually a lot similar to other games except you can add your own things and create however you want it to be set up. By so far, this game is the easiest game and has the most entertaining gamemodes I've ever played.
Doctor;-;Horrible game. Nothing to do. Can't even play it without giving myself 11 lethal injections. Don't buy it. Save your money on something better, like a pistol. I wish I bought a pistol with this Garry's Mod money. I could've killed myself because of this game. I wish I ran the boston marathon instead of buying this game. . Nah, it's a cool gome. Buy it. (Take note of my in-game hours.)
Chrispy;-;This game gets boring quick 13/10
Your mom;-;Very great sandbox. You can download all the addons you'd like, or if you don't find them, make them! Singleplayer will get boring after a while, but multiplayer won't. I suggest you buy it for the multiplayer.
Apetros;-;Its really good. when i get bored i just play it. but you need to download some textures but its ok
Papa Dookins;-;This is more than a game, it is a console with many game types. Any true steam user must have this game
hellGeneral;-;Funny as hell just play it.
xjohn42;-;Super fun xD I love playin' with friends and stuff 8/10 i think
Swin Dills;-;one of the best games ever
FuhReel;-;I LIKE THIS GAME BECAUSE IT IS VERY COOL 5 ***** ALL DUH WAY NIKKAH
Fluffy Butt;-;well... this is a good game.
Berserker SiNz;-;ever since i saw gassymexican and Seananners play gmod i would say i was hooked on it right when i saw the gameplay i HIGHLY recomend you get this game
Natalie_Bear;-;Trapped a Squeaker with watermelons Exploded somebody with a stick 11/10
Hazza109;-;Garry's Mod is a fun and creative game with loads of aspects of the game to explore, as you can change the gametypes (e.g go on servers) but server admins and mods get a little bit petty at times and also the game is a little bit buggy, but a very solid game with decent graphics, would definetely recommend the game for the money.
AlexSenpai;-;Really fun! :D
NovA Blaze;-;This game is amazing!!!
Reggie;-;Garrys Mod is not a game. It is a physics toy and sandbox style tool. That doesn't matter as Garrys Mod is pure fun no matter what you choose to do. G-Mod has an infinite amount of replay value. The amount of content is extremely high and many more things are being made as Best Maps..Deathrun, Prop Hunt and Terrosit Town..
Brutal Doomguy;-;This game is really good period.
Thatrandomguy;-;The game is fun cause you never know what to expect. You can do anything you want.
Brotosaurus Sex;-;Now I haven't played a whole lot of this game, but I can say this, It is a fun way for you and your friends to get together and do just about anything. Hide and Seek, no longer awkward and in public! Especially with old men! Basic Physics games, not just for the bedroom anymore! RolePlaying! (See above) You can even watch youtube with a bunch of strangers! INNOVATION. I give this game a solid 10/10.
Gucci Gundam;-;My friend got knifed into a chandelier Got stuck on a lego set 01000010111010101010/10
Dubstep Fever;-;I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Crestfall;-;This is not a game. This is a new world. A world of freedom.
McDaddySlick;-;This game destroys friendships.
lugia2011;-;awesome game to be honest
The Ghost;-;Very fun and entertaining to  around on all day :P
Ramses_2k;-;IF THIS GAME WAS A GIRL, I WOULD KISS IT
Patinaz;-;Killed a guy by chucking a washing machine at him 420/69 ~PC Gamer
|TBC| Killer Dragon;-;One of if not the best game i have EVER played. with thousands of mods hundreds of maps servers multiplayer combat rp. YOU NAME IT Its here.
Big Black Guy;-;You. Can. Do. Anything. (That the Source engine is capable of doing). 10/10
Omega;-;Crashes 98% of the time. 10/10
The Fear Turkey;-;The better edition of Minecraft.
DaT MiKe ThO24;-;this game is amazing outstanding! everlasting creation
Chu_Chu;-;One time me and my friends went one an adventure on a magical flying snake with turbo thrusters. 8/10
kicku360;-;In garrys mod you start out with items and props from halflife and other valve games. With the power of steam workshop you can pretty much find ANYTHING, this can be a very very weird game depending how you play it. i DEFIENTY recommend this game to anyone that wants to have a little fun or like me 2 days straight and more of fun. This is a must play game @ a very cheap price must get.
Gronkaliscious;-;Great Game! Gmod Allows You To Mess Around With Physics Awesome Gamemodes And Play Around With Community Built Mods!!!! 1000000/10
67mens;-;i made a nuckulare elsa and set it of with the bullets of a flying watermellon... 10/10!
Liberty Prime;-;Endless game. For those of you who can't figure, it's a sandbox that's really powered by the community. People upload their mods and addons, and you can download them for free. Never gets old 10/10 (P.S. I'd personally reccommend to get the CS:S/Gmod bundle if you're going to try out Prop Hunt, as most maps and textures can only be used if you own that)
Etherious Natsu Dragneel;-;Great game and better if you play with friends. When i am bored i choose this game to make my day... Great Game...
Schme;-;Definetely worth its money
MyNameJeff;-;Such a great game with hours of fun so much do.
Nightmare Tankicorn;-;Well holy hell, this here's one of the easiest games to win, for chrissake! All you have to do is spawn somewhere, and you're winning already! Not to mention tthe first time you play it, you get an Achievement, so that's freakin' Icing on the Cake! Not only that, there's all kinds of things you can do, like create devices using Props 'n' stuff, make Comics with Characters, and stop-motion Vids like the many Gmod Vids you can find on YouTube. It links up to the majority of games you already possess as well, like if you have TF2, the TF2 Characters, props, and weapons will be available for you to spawn. Definitely something worth looking at when you just want to mess around.
Jsus;-;I think gmod (garrys mod) is a really fun sandbox game that is fun for all ages of the steam community
Pajama Sam;-;Endless hours of fun!!!
Hive Mind;-;Garry's mod... I was a little late on this game, I heard about it from youtube, the videos they can make with it is just quite funny... Anyways, I only have about 20 hours of Garry's mod when I write this review... But let me tell you... That is PLENTY of time to tell you how much fun this "Game" is. I put game in quotations, because it's not really a game... It's a sandbox that let's you create your game, and much more. I love screwing around on this and making my own levels to face baddies, such as spawn on a TF2 map and then make it filled with Combine to shoot. You do need a game for this. The one that is recommeded is Team fortress 2. Since it's free to play. And that's another unique aspect of this game. It takes the games you have, if they are able to, and give you the maps and ragdolls and models to do as you wish. Garry's mod is basically ran with the same weapon system and health system as Half Life 2. As well as the same sounds. I can't really explain this game to you well, because words cannot be put on how awesome it is. Also, this game has workshop, and that means you can download models, and other things that'll expand what Garry's mod has to offer. This game can't really die, since people in the community are expanding it more and more. I recommend you get this game. worth every penny.
PhoKingDuy;-;I went from downloading godzilla to making woody from toy story kill zombies in workshop 10/10 would buy.
PaNDooo;-;Amazing game, never gets boring as there is unlimited posibilities of what to make build and play. There is also loads or community made mods and addons created by skilled creaters with the goal of making you enjoy the game. You can also upload your creations for the whole Garry's Mod community to see. Lots of gamemode and even more being created.
jimbobslimbob;-;Great fun to be had in this sandbox / creative "mod" for Half Life 2. Want to weld a toilet to a car? Go for it. This game has been a favourite of mine for some time now - and I always seem to come back to it every now and then for some manic play. You can run through the Half Life 2 levels, or try your hand at a sandbox map. There are also a multitude of really good stuff on the Steam Workshop to further enhance your fun. It's cheap and it's immensely fun. Get some friends together and get creative! Jimbo Rating: 8/10
Almar;-;Garry's mod. Oh garry's mod what a fantastic game! All the way from gameplay to gamemodes to graphics just amazing! i dont like it just because you do whatever the heck you please on this game because of the gamemodes! DarkRP:you role play as you are in a real city and real life jobs about 35+ of jobs just amazing it would take all night to talk about what you can do on it. Trouble in Terrorist Town:there are people few of them are terrorists they try to kill every body while incoents try to kill the terrorist who to trust who to not? Prop hunt: there are 2 teams props and prophunters the prophunters try to look for props but props disguise as any prop. and a few dozen more gamemodes So what are you waiting for? BUY THE GAME! OR ILL EAT YOUR COOKIES. Why are you still reading? dude go buy it. Rating 11/10
LOLME8;-;Pure Awesomeness
Magoichi;-;I have wasted a week of my life playing this game and it has been a blast. Really awesome sandbox game. Trying to go for the whole year wasted haha.
DeceivedPretzelz;-;You build stuff and kill people and yeah... That's all there is to it. It's strangely fun!
Icarus132;-;This game is amazing its perfect to have for every reason theres not a thing you cant do with it
Olga Volga Boatman :3;-;So much comic, and violence. It has amazing graphics, and many add-ons. This game is basically life in a PC game. It stars all HL, HL2, CS:S, DOD:S, etc. characters. Altho, the NPCs are not as realistic as the original HL 2 characters, but they do back you up when you need it. 10/10
MarkitoTheMexicanBear-#RiPSkins;-;Hours of fun!
BabyDoll;-;LOOOOVE IT
Sergeant Sylveon;-;"This rocket ship couldn't possibly fail. It has 80 thrusters and a cutout of a cow on the side. it's been proven ready for space trav- it exploded. It- it's completely gone. Okay." 10/10
Blue Moon Runner;-;It'a a Awsome sandbox game.
Nicolas Cage;-;Im addicted!
Dr Pepper | {STONED};-;fun game with lots of options. would recomend you get CS:S for the textures first.
xX_SWAGMaster420_Xx;-;normally i use this for educational purposes.
Sniper Turtle;-;A game where melons are better weapons than guns and everyone is a . 11/10 would melon again.
Tommy Fresh;-;Super fun and hilarious game! Definitely worth buying!
ThatGunnerKid;-;Garrys Mod Is A Fun Game To Play Cause It Has Sandbox TTT Deathrun and Much More :D If U Ever Get It ENJOY IT BEFORE IT GETS OLD
Merchant2006;-;A Source Engine playground. You can do anything from modelling to making your own stupid Garry's Mod video. Pure, pure fun and I never get tired of throwing ragdolls and making my favourite characters' face into a mad drunk expression/happy smile/ in my pants expression.
PhilKing;-;Very fun and addictive. Easy to make friends and have a laugh.
<BKC>Cpt.Knight;-;Great game and if your interested join my gmod clan no requirements non profit just for gaming
RedWolf;-;I lovvee Garry's mod and it's really good, if you like casual gaming like me i THINK this is a pretty good game to play ^_^
Fag Nasty;-;A great game to play
BHOP!;-;this game has benn my best game in my hole games list and i love it.
kayla.brightwell;-;This game is the most amazing thing. My new favourite!!
OctoberFEST!;-;The game is best recommended to those who enjoy the HL2 engine, and thought to themselves, what if I could do more with it? The game has no limit, and has kept me entertained with plenty of addons and dupes from the workshop, such as a laser gun, some meme models, and lots upon lots of ragdolls. This game can be yours for a decent price, and whats more, any other games that use the HL2 engine, can be mounted, and the resources from that game can be used as well. Some popular games can be mounted include: All of the HL2 games. (duh,) Portal, Portal 2, and Left4Dead. (I think thats right, I don't own the game myself, but still.) Take my review as another reason to buy the game. After all, look how long I've been playing it. *FACT* There is achievements made just for wasting your time. One week, one month, one year. Oh well.
brett20749;-;dont shoot a patato gun at a dragon it crashes the server 10/10
Pixe[L];-;very fun game :D you can spend a whole day just playing it!
Corrupting Mage;-;Gmod is amazing you can do like anything doesnt take that much to run it. Hilarious, you can build stuff or yaaa. kill zombies.
KingPito;-;this game is great & you dont need much computer experience to play it either
mjyelito;-;this game is really fun and I think you should play it :)
Pickles;-;I've played thousands of hours of GMod starting with GMod 9. It's still pretty good and I still play it.
vndictve;-;great game, espesially for people that like playing multiplayer. I know that some people are like (prepare for mockery text) "OH DEAR LORD, I HAVE TO SPEND LIKE 50 FRIGG'N DOLLAS AND I STILL HAVE TO INSTALL STUFF PFT, DIS GAME IS NOT WORT IT". It is worth it depending on 1, your preference 2, how much time you play on the game and 3, weather or not your patient.
BlazeDemingo;-;Clearly, It is a Timeless open sandbox game! You will never get bored of it!
Pepe;-;By far the best $10 I spent!
Sarah Palin's Left Breast;-;who wouldn't recommend this game
Steveamundo;-;High recommendations for half-life, and source game fans, also I would recommend it to people who like really strange glitchy game character porn xD

The Potato King;-;The mother of all Mods.
Jurassic Lion;-;A must have for any gamer, tons of gamemodes and all super fun.
Delfo3333;-;Garry's Mod; where do I begin? This was one of the first games (it's so much more than a game) I got on my PC. I played it, crathed it and faved it; it was so fun! After countless hours of Sandbox I figured I would try something new. I made the life-changing decision to click the 'find multiplayer game' and after that, well, I didn't see my Mother for weeks. Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Role Play, Slender, the list goes on and on. After discovering owning other VALVE games added content to the already MASSIVE game, I couldn't resist. I now own most games they have made and honestly? Best money I've spent on gaming my whole, juvenile life... Worth absolutely every penny 10/10 and always getting better.
rock;-;TO MUCH SWEG
KittehLoaf;-;Garry's Mod is really a fun thing to do, especially when you want to kill some time. This I recommend playing with another person or four. It makes it more fun. :D

Blonde Jesus;-;if you like creative little games this is a good game
Garebear;-;Oh man, where do I even start with this game. Garry's Mod is one of a kind, and it's the only game out there truely like it with all the content it contains. This game has downloadable content, customization, addons, and so much stuff. And, if you're an up and coming coder, or you want to be, the Expression 2 (E2) in this game is a great place to start, giving you so much to lean on and explore in the sandbox of Garrys mod. Of course, there isn't just Sandbox. There's TTT, a very popular one. DarkRP and other RP's are also popular. So much to do, so little time. Just ask my 1000+ hours. I've invested a portion of my life into this game and the servers on it, and I was not dissapointed.
Online;-;Worth it. But just does get boring after 250 hours
Arctic;-;Got it for 2 dollars, it's alright.
RockyPlaysPC;-;if you like minecraft or tf2 and all valve games youll love garrys mod
shaddy;-;I think this game is a good and productive to play with many varities of gamemodes and this is why i love to play it so much.
gniluh;-;So much to do in this game. I have been playing this game for years before I got my own account and loved every moment of it. The best part about this game is the insanely awesome mods made for it.
Xaine99;-;Garry's Mod is the ultimate sandbox game. Anything you want to create, you can! Literally hundreds of thousands of mods \ addons available and you can even create your own using 3D applications and importing them. With wiremod, you can even program things such as robotics or other highly complex actions. Good stuff!
Boo;-;love this ;3

[M~TTT] ZombieTM;-;It's amazing when you know what servers to go to, find out what game modes you like, and what you can make with all the addons. The possibilities are endless. (note: if you have a sucky computer, addware, ect. your expirience will be diffrent until you fix all your problems)
Bird;-;I was a giant fridge, no one noticed me until I started running through the hallways. Prophunt is he best. I also killed Terrorists that were invading the Minecraft realm inside Gmod. So I'm assuming all gamemodes are this awesome. 11/10 for being a giant fridge.
Wer6;-;Fun! GO play with dead body's! make constructions of various amounts of stupidity/ utter genius
Diverta7;-;Get Garry's Mod. Do anything you want.
` $;-;If you do not have this game,BUY IT.This is possibly one of the best games on Steam,by far.
Nathanor;-;This game is pretty fun, there are many ragdolls and cool weapons mod to play with in the workshop. Other then that you can have fun summon some guys to kill them, or if you are good at it build things. =) You can also build and play with your friends, if you can get the sever to work.
ZOMBIEKILL 73;-;I have a very slow computer i mean minecraft is a pain trying to run so i was thinking the same about gmod but gmod is a breeze i spawned around 25 zombies and it was fine somebody spammed explosives took my computer down 10-15 fps but it was fine you wont see that during normal gameplay you will just need counter strike source and you will 85% of the textures available to you recommend you get this during this holiday sale and you get the counter strike source w/ gmod pack so you can get both very cheap
CrazyFoxy3258 $.$ SWAGMLGFOX!;-;This game is awesome 9/10
TrIcki;-;I killed a Guy with a Melon. This is totally worth it.

DeDeSvK;-;Garry's Mod is an awesome game perfect game when someone is bored.
danciestjackson;-;Invaded the Combine Tower on a death kart made of doll heads that fired missles. 10/10 Would kart again
Dusty;-;This game can become very VERY addicting if spent with friends on servers, really enjoyable and a good price in the summer sale :D
PurpleDerpyDerp;-;You do terrible and awful things to people in sandbox doing the most stupid things you can build a man's pride, spawn in tons of npc then mow them now, do adventure maps and anything else that you want... Many fun game modes on multiplayer with little kids screaming at you... 10 cods out of 10
Seller Of Mandarins;-;i have owned gmod for a couple of months now, it is the best sandbox game i have ever tried out so far. since i got this on steam, it is easy to download mods through the workshop. I love this game, especially this gamemode i have been trying, Zombie Survival.
(|)lll((|o|))lll(|);-;One of the funnest games I have ever played. You never run out of things to do.
Nazi_Jesus;-;this game is great for messing around and just having a good non serious time
Cescon;-;i love this game ;D
WoodenHouse;-;Great fun to  around in, or to roleplay/kill each other/watch videos on cinema servers. Plenty of things to do, plenty of gametypes to play, never a dull moment.
Wub[In Cali];-;Best game I have ever played by far. Well worth the money and great for single and multiplayer experiences.
Trygre;-;Oh Garry's Mod, you have entertained me for hours. Yet it's really hard to make an review for this game. as it is more of a "engine" for a lot of games within this game. Think of Garry's Mod as a really weird canvas which many have created awesome art on. It's just hard to describe. If you're not satisfied easily then this game might be excelent for you. Why? Well as this game has way more to offer then just messing around, it offers so much more then an average "real game" would these days. For this exact reason I love this "game", it allows being f*cked around in, but aswell gives this incredeble freedom which others might not exploit but build on. If you're not certain if you want it I strongly recommend checking if you have more Source games in your Steam Libary such as Counter Strike: Source and Half Life 2 (and episodes) since Garry's Mod (or GMOD) uses them as resources for texures and items you wouldn't want to miss out on, since most servers use these textures aswell you basicly need them to get the full expierence out of this game! (Yes I did it, I called this "Garry's MOD" a game!) So I'd recoomend this game to everyone that just... wants to have fun!
Peach;-;You can get away with anything in this game. 11/10
Double Diamond (Fried GPU);-;This game. It's legendary. It might not look as good, you know, a generic sandbox, nothing special, blah blah blah.. but once you actually invest time into it, you start to enjoy it. And get addicted, if you play regularly. (   )
Stormy;-;Great game, even playing on single player, and then even better on multiplayer!
Goddess Lunaversity;-;So let me get the basic part out first. This game is an awesome Open-Source sandbox game. It has many features you can do, this game inspired me to start programming with games instead of just web. I code a lot for this game but that's not it. I love playing the games they have, I love sandbox the most because of the creations you can make or destroy with your friends. This has to be one of the most popular games on steam. If you have money, spend it on this game. It's worth it. All my friends I mostly met on this game from servers. Well I guess that is all, but this game is awesome for everyone.
GEICO;-;tower...........ING AMAZING XD
thingy;-;Nothing you CANT do
Jahova;-;Pretty fun! Buy it!
Ninja of Darkness;-;This game is the ultimate sandbox
Jertz is O+;-;If you don't own this, don't know what you've been doing. This game has endless possibilities what to do. I've spent around 5000 hours on this game playing different mods such as Sandbox, roleplaying, RPG's, TTT and tons of others. Met a lot of friends aswell from the gamemode communities.
mickie muse;-;My butt feels nice an squitshy
FuZionBoi;-;This game is the type of game that just doesn't get old. Plenty of different gamemodes to choose from. Wanna just kill people? Do you want to play hide and seek? Maybe play build a sled and race? Or do you just want to watch YouTube videos with friends. Look no further as GMOD can become a whole different genre of game by switching servers.
24Hr Pizza;-;I like this game, its a game within a game which has many more games, for the 5.99 i spent and the 300+ hours i have got out of it i would say its worth every penny
Intelligar;-;Its fun but can get boring pretty fast if you play solo like me.
Lillysky;-;10/10 would bang
Han Solo;-;This game is awesome even if you play Singleplayer or Multiplayer. By the way i got killed by refrigirator so 10/10
LongDanzi;-;some of you may be wondering, What is garry's mod? answer: It's Garry's mod I think the bigger question here is, Why haven't you got it yet?
The Cleric;-;This is most likely one of the greatest sandbox games on the Steam Webstore with plenty of things to do from making a floating piece of wood with some decorations to a motorised bathtub to a fully functunal ship! Or just stack up wooden objects and set them on fire. And if the vanilla version doesn't grab your tastes, get some addons! This game has an outstanding number of addons that can be downloaded with a click of a button! Some addons are made for great new building experiences, take Expression 2 and Wiremod for example, with the use of wiremod you can create working doors and other things (not that good with wiremod so can't give detailed explanation) and with Expression 2 you can make Holograms, Teleporters and big explosions. Although this is an amazing game and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who's looking for a unique sandbox experience there is probably only ONE thing that I dislike about it... And it's that if you don't have certain games like Half Life or Counter Strike, some textures and models won't work, this include black and pink checkerboxes and big flashing Errors signs, (luckily I have found a way around this, check out this website to get free models and textures from games such as Portal, Half Life and Counter Strike http://kajar9.wix.com/2 - go to the GarryContent tab to gain access to the resources, THIS IS NOT PIRACY, it is not letting you play seperate games for free it is simply giving you textures and models for gmod) other than that issue I give it a rating of 9/10, Definately got my money's worth
Joe;-;Gmod Where to Start? Amazing Open world Sandbox type game with limitless potental, I like the Workshop Feature in the game so users and easly improve there game experiance and make the lifetime of this game even longer. Anyway Who doesnt like Straping a thruster to a couch and shooting it off into space? This game is FUN, A MUST GET!
Gevz;-;Literally just for screwing around. Fun and flexible.
iTzGuS;-;i love this game so fun with friends or alone
UnheardPie;-;One of the most anything is possible (within a wide limit) sandbox game ever! Loads of mods and loads of things to make!

Bass Cross Megaman;-;in great 81 stars out of 3
The Archbishop Of Banterbury;-;Best Game I Have Ever Played XD 10/10
Alpha Wolfy;-;Garry's Mod has got to be one of the best sandbox games of all time. Everything about it is so simple yet addictive. Whenever I get on Garry's M od, I always start to play TTT. TTT is a very fun game mode. The exhiliration of being a traitor is what makes the game mode stand out. One negative is that players on specific servers can be sometimes unresonable, stupid or flat out annoying. For example, some servers on Murder, another game mode, really dont take the game seriously. Server Lag is also another drawback to garry's mod. I also consider the fact that you have to buy games to get textures for GMOD pretty stupid because of the cost of the games and storage use. Comments aside, I reccommmend Garry's Mod because of it's replay value, TTT, Prop Hunt and Deathrun. If you can get over the negatives on GMOD, then you will definitly find your self playing milions of hours of TTT over and over again every day. 8/10.
fock jock lock dock;-;I defininetly reccomend this game. Its fun cheap and lets you do whatever you want, want to shoot Hatsune Miku in the boob? You got it, want to make a whole city with props, and kill everyone in it, bam. Garrys mod. Buy it
Solarity;-;its aight
KittieMissMew;-;First time playing : Threw a chair in the air with Physgun. Got kicked from server a minute later for prop killing. . 11/10 would play again.
AWUUHH SEX;-;Awesome Sauce:)
Game Genie;-;Excellent game that can be played for years
arkblox;-;I made a rollercoaster, turned into a pigeon and gathered an army of zombies to kill surviving humans and nuked everything (Except my army of zombies)
The Warrior of Frost;-;Really good game hours of fun 10/10 recommended
Teh MLG Panda;-;This is an amazing. Play this for a day and you'll know what i'm talking about
Filthy Casual I Am;-;There are no limits to this game, if you can think it then you can probably make it. Being bored on this game is rare and there is always something to do and plenty of downloads on Garrysmod.org to enhance your gameplay experience. There is so much for such a low price.
Tabby (_);-;I have over 2070+ hours on this game and I've just gotta say I don't regret any of it. The hours I've spent on this game have been really worthwhile memories that I enjoy looking back to. This game is comprised of physics and buidling, really fun to do with other people and is also a gate way to meeting people online and playing multiple game modes consisting popularly of Dark Role Play, Prop Hunt, (One of my favourites) Murder and Sledbuild! The game is always cheap as well so go buy it and play it because this is a truly great and fun game. Although I only recommend really playing it multiplayer on servers because its very lonely/boring by yourself. But you MUST make sure you have ALL the half life 2 games installed as well as maybe TF2 and Left 4 Dead since this game uses the models from those games for the basic building blocks. You can also install Addons to improve the quality of your building! Happy Building People <3 If you are interested in lookin for some pictures just look at my Screen Shots for Gmod I have a ton!
TEH SWAGGIEST SWAG THAT EVA SWAG;-;Wanna know if this game is good? Look at my hours played. No way I sunk 3 thousand hours into a terrible game.
CherryEgia;-;best creation game i have ever played also played this game for 1838 hours and still counting so it poves how good it is and there is a hell of a lot of addons that you can get to :P
Futurestic;-;I have had this game for nearly 2 years and i am still surprised at what you can do the addons are unlimited allowing you to take your imagination to the highest level. At first i though it was a game where you could do a few things, but when i found out about the addons the possibilities increased by ten folds. If you like driving a car off a hill like in GTA you can. Anything you think of is possible. If you looked at how old this game is you will be surprised at how many people still want to buy this game and how many people still play it. If you like to let your imagination run wild then this is a must for you. Even if you are someone who likes wierd games this is a game for you, anytype of games you like its all jumbled into one in the best way possible. so overall i suggest you buy the game now!
gooper;-;garry's mod isn't like other games. You can manipulate it however you wish, making crazy contraptions galore. It's your world, you can mess about with it. build stuff and blow it up. have brilliant battles with vehicles you've made. shove thrusters on stuff. blast things off the map and into space. then do it over again. I highly reccomend this game - it's a must-have.
Pyro-Technic;-;GMod is ENDLESS creativity... stuffed inside a microchip on fire which has ants all over it and its being eaten by the Gman. Seriously though, Cool game. Worth the $$$!
[T.N] Black Dog;-;I can watch porn with friends. 10/10

Septimus2502;-;Wow. Garry's Mod. An amazing game, fitting into anyone's taste. Modder? This game is workshop compatible. People person? Multiplayer and sharing your creations is extremely easy. A bit of a derp? Flailing is easy when you get the hang of thrusters and elastic. Hermit? Singleplayer is still enjoyable. This game is perfect for anyone.

AppelKaneel;-;BEST PARTY -GAME EVER! I love to play party games with friends and if I could give a b-day present, it would be Gmod! You won't be disappointed, because there are many gametypes, such as Hide and Seek, Prop Hunt, bomberman, Murderer even Cinema (how crazy is that?! watching a movie with friends in-game, it couldn't get crazier) The game is always in developemnt, because Garry's Mod is open-source, so new gamemodes, weapons, action and fun are waiting for you :) Just get the game, it's worth it and if you've a money problem, just eat at you neighbours for one week..!
Seth4564TI;-;filled with "save" workshops that don't work 9001/420
Mr . Pinkachew;-;Awesome and funny game.Best multiplayer game ever!
TheGladex;-;Garry's mod is an amazing source based sandbox. It contains many different gamemodes with countless ammounts of custom content which just expands this already huge game. I deeply recomend for people who just look for a game to have fun in, create dumb builds without a story or an actuall point to it.

Sparky the Jolteon;-;Garry's Mod is a extremely fun game and a good recommendation for people who love to build and create stuff. There's no rules in the game (well maybe some). Just have fun and be creative. It's impossible to act normal in Garry's Mod
Tobie240;-;I played this game for three enire days without stopping. And on the third day I came to realize.. "What had I been doing?" What about this game had consumed three days of my life? Was Gmod just my excuse to ignore the real world? Was it all just a game cooked up by my mind? The real world was not Gmod right? Right?! How had I not realized this before? "I need to do something about this!" It was then that I had finished downloading the server and my mind forgot again.. And I continued to play forever... 11/10 Would play forever again
Noah Shy;-;THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS!
VampireGaming;-;Great and funny game you guys did a great job making this you guys are going on my top 10 awesome and funny video games
Bonnie, The human rabbit;-;A beautifully crafted sandbox game which started out as a mod for the popular game "Half life 2", this game is truely a masterpiece among sandbox games, it has limitless possibilities, you can make your own weapons, edit makes, make mods (WHICH ARE EASY TO INSTALL BY CLICKING ONE BUTTON, TO ALL OF YOU PEOPLE OUT THERE LIKE ME WHO AREN'T GOOD AT INSTALLING MODS MANUALLY) Gameplay is just downright hilarious, and paired with some gore mods from the workshop, it can make you fall of your chair rithing around in laughter. 900/10

Mechman126;-;I am at loss for words for this perfect game, On the surface it looks amazing but when you delve deeper it gets even better! It is a perfect mix of zany fun and also meaningful creation. It has infinite possibilities and also has an expansive mod database. This is the pinnacle of sandbox gaming!
Dokie;-;Very Cool Game
Franz von Stryker;-;The game has been going for nearly 10 years, that says it all. One of the only truly open sandbox games of endless possibility, one minute on dark rp your a cop stopping criminals, the next the criminal, the next an innocent civilian on ttt, or an astronaut in spacebuild. Endless possibility, as long as you have endless imagination and the mixture of a great company and a great player base has kept this game alive for so long. Definitely worth the 10 bucks.
Epix0;-;Awesomeness....awesomeness everywhere!
freewij2;-;Everyones doing it, you should do it.
M3LLn;-;A great sandbox game for everyone, besides the fact that if you want to play other game modes or most addons you need CS:S. but bundle them together or wait for a steam sale and there ya go.

TheFordow;-;One word - Melons. (10\10 ~IGN)
Vibe162;-;Worth. It.
[IM] ZillyTheRaptor;-;Spawned a bunch of zombies, got mobbed by them. 11/10
(Foojile) Arno Darius|GR-559;-;Spent lots of time in this its a great game I recommend the counterstrike,garrysmod pack also download Wire a great mod that is useful and many servers use it :D
Walter White;-;If you're thinking on "Yaayy Gmod, I'll be famous, videoz yay yay" you're wrong. That simple thing is the hardest thing to do on this game. But, this has a few nice gamemodes which are cool, but they get boring after a while. Is it worth the buy? Of course it is, as long as you pick it up on sale. 6/10.
Tswizzle;-;Whenever I read or hear hate about this game, it is always about how this isn't a game. These people are right, it's a lifestyle.
Mr.Fluffybuns;-;Garry's Mod is the brainchild of Garry Newman, who wanted to create a physics-based sandbox based on the Source engine which also allows other players to create mods for the game too. So the game has a truly MASSIVE amount of variety. In singleplayer, you canbuild your own NPC arena, populate it with conflicting characters and watch them kill each other. On zombie survival, be a human fighting for your life while a zombie horde slowly infects the rest of your band of survivors. On Trouble in Terrorist Town, take control of a 'Traitor' Terrorist, and collaborate with other Traitors to wipe out all the 'Innocent' Terrorists, either through the use of a suicide bomb or sniping each innocent off, one by one. And in the excellent Dark RP, a multiplater role-playing mod built for the game, you start of as a citizen, but if you wish you can choose a different job, such as a police officer and take on crime head-on, or a mob boss with a gang the size of everyone in the server called 'The Tunnel Snakes' who own the cops through successful blackmail and bribery, or a sadistic gun dealer who's only pleasure is to kill everyone he sees, or a hobo and beg for money, or a hitman charging $100 per kill. Or in the fantastic ''Prop Hunt'' where you either start off as a hunter and fend your way to slaughter all props which hide,or be a prop and hide hoping no-one will find you-personally this and Trouble in terrorist town Are my favorites.-Or just be a citizen and build. The game is fantastic, with the only flaws being the aged (but highly forgiveable) graphics and the occasional glitches and LUA cache errors. But I don't usually judge games based on minor technical problems. I judge them on the experience I've had with the game. And mine was fantastic.9.9/10 .1 Off because lua errors,Otherwise great game,Great!I recomend it,seriously buy it now if you havn't.
NmUn;-;THRUSTERS EVERYWHERE. EVERYONE IS DEAD SO MUCH DEATH. I HAVE DAILY FLASHBACKS OF THE WAR BECAUSE OF THIS I likely have more hilarious physics related deaths than a dozen play-throughs of DarkSouls. This game is worth everything I payed and more. And unless you're about as creative as a rock you'll definitely enjoy the sh t out of this game.
7;-;This game is awesome
Laboony;-;The Best.

Fireravens;-;this i s a very humerus game, i just tthink you should have the textures right off the bat, and have more tsuff in the game
doot;-;Best game that is $10
_SapphireBlood_;-;I love this game very much and I feel that others should play it too. It is definitely worth having to pay for it! I suggest this game because it let's your creativity flow, and is loads of fun to play with friends too! I like that you can use different tools for specific, different things. Overall, I have no complaints. Great game 10/10!

Cosmic Battery Juice;-;Awesome game! Much better with friends!
Firez;-;Too much to say in one review. You can never get bored of it, theres so many things to do, 10's to 100's of gamemodes, plus workshop support, it's possiblely the most entertaining game I've never played, and I will never stop playing it. This game is pure brilliance.
NexxHD;-;its the BEST
Haywire;-;this game good
Ruf CTR3;-;Uh, idk why the game has bugs? Game quit/Crash/Freeze HUD glitch
=UGB=Secret;-;The game is by far one of the most diverse i have ever played. It has so many modes so that no one can have an excuse to say they don't like it. Its great in every way and allows players to make their own modes of a game. One problem is just the loading times but apart from that its fine.
Dogeness;-;It is fun and derpy and theres a lot of stuff you can do in it
Tiblets J;-;ITS LAGS BUT THERE IS SO MUCH STUFF YOU CAN GET STUFF LIKE FAITH FROM MIRRORS EGDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!EXTREAMLY GOOD SO I RECOMEND IT TO ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
javaf3tt;-;Mess around. Do what you want. Enough said.
Dark_Delirious;-;Endless creations that you can create, if you don't have the game already, you don't know what your missing out on!
The Zoker;-;Amazing game!!!! 1. If you have friends its a great game to play with them 2. If you dont have friends its a great way to make them 3. If you cant make friends Sandbox is fun
Sullivan;-;It's anything you want it to be.
dptzippy;-;This game is one of the best game of all time. Well worth the payment.
[WNG] CRUVOD;-;Essentially Minecraft on steroids. (Not really)
Mr. Cat;-;Went On A Server That Had A Guy As A  With His Face At End 17/12 Would Be On Crack Again
Snowman;-;This game is awesome, feel free to do what you like, has a ton of cool gamemodes
ERGH!;-;this is a great game! it's so fun to pose stuff!
XX_BILLY_XX;-;This game is one of the greatest games I've ever played. Period.
RottnFresh;-;This game is a fun sandbox game to see how the real world works.If you dont believe me check out the game for its sandbox and other fun server games.
Taco Bait;-;A creative game where there are many different gamemodes for example , Trouble in terrorist town ( TTT ) , Murder , Prop hunt and many more ! This game is basically an all in one sort of game where there are more one game for people to play so you will never get bored. Even though this game cost abt 9 USD , I would recommend you to buy this game as it is worth it and you should give it a try !
ALLAHU AKBAR;-;705 Hours. Best game to troll on, best game in general. MUST BUY
ALLUminati;-;Good and fun to play. K bye.
lil' ol' littel;-;Sandbox as good as it can be at the right moment. Roleplay, annoy people, built sexual things with rocket boosters or even learn basic scripting on Lua. There is nothing new i can say about it, you kind of must experience GMod.
kayne379;-;This game is good, it makes your imagination come to life or if you don't like to do that, you can play different types of gamemodes online so you can satisify yourself with the fun, joy and laughter. You wouldn't even stop mplaying this game because this game is the best but the downsides onto this game you need to buy certain games to obtain textures to play on online or offline so that's the bad side of this game.
tBK =DD;-;One does not simply play a game for 800 hours and call it bad.
ToniCodrea;-;I had a Nyan Cat gun and my friend had a pedobear player model. Lots of fun.
[87CF] PFC.Ryder Xander[KGC-Co];-;This is an awesome game U can make your own servers on it witch it's really fun to play with people on your own terms Olny problem is hackers and 10 year olds So i guess its good for the review
Venomizard;-;Amazing game, Great modding support, and overall the fanbase is great too. Get this game! 10/10
oOo D03Y oOo;-;This game is all about Garry and different ways you can mod him, such as acquiring pretty dresses and wigs that you can place on Garry to make him look as sexy as possible but don't go overboard because he'll  Ya! ...I really regret buying that bikini for Garry I'll never walk the same way again.
Barbaric Monkey;-;Fun game with no objective 9/10
A$ap Chaka;-;If you enjoy listening to kids screaming on the mic saying "Rdm" than this is the game for you. My Verdict: 11/10 Would buy again
[BS] Slim;-;love this game but you need the textures
PACMAN;-;This game is possibly one of the best sandbox games out there that has a fair price. What makes this different from other titles is it has a growing community that not just plays the game, but makes mods, gamemodes and much more content. Garry's Mod is great, but the things it lacks is graphics and textures. Since Garry's Mod takes textures from other games, you need to get that game so errors, missing textures and script errors dont pop up. But its a small price to pay just to get Counter-Strike: Source. Garry's Mod's community is filled with large maps and mods that are interesting. This game is amazing. So I give it a 97/100.
CaptainCrazy;-;ITs realy fun and creative 10/10
Blast5240;-;super fun gam its the epic one game
LemonLunder;-;Go ing crazy. Buy this game.
@DG.wp;-;So much trash in 1 game ^^
It's Stef;-;I LOVE IT!!!!!! ;DDD. So many things to do and so many games to play that you will never get bored!!! Buy it now!
The Gaming Pi;-;It is an indie, Sandbox that offers hours of fun! Play for one Minute, you will want to play for hours, there are thousands of addons to download! Rating: *****
RaiderCSA;-;I was in love with this game from the start. I have already in less than a year put more than 250 hours into this game, and i have loved every hour of it. Its one of the most fun games of all time (in my personal opinion, i know i misspelled it). I have nothing but good things to say about this game. So thats it other wise it would just be me rambling about how good this game is even though you have probobly heard it a hundered times if you play pc.
Commander Skycancer;-;It doesn't really lie about the "level editor" that is included with it, but it doesn't work. The files are there, it just isn't set up or something. The mappers I talk to use the SDK single player 2013 or, what I use, the Half-life 2 editor, to make maps for garrysmod.
Dusk Strider;-;You can do literally anything! The best game in my library, by far!
Herpes are Dangerous (;-;You can make a floating rocket  made out of barrels. What more could you want?
SpazzKhidd;-;10/10 would ing buy 20 times Joined a DarkRP server, turned into a DJ opened a club the people started pouring in giving me $500,000 to be in the VIP area and then we jammed out. Then out of nowhere a theif exploded and I yelled "EVERY GET THE  DOWN" People backed up, I crouched and went to the dead body. His last words were "This party was to ing OP for me m8" Then everyone jumped back up and I started blasting music again and we all danced as the thief lay dead there for like 5 minutes. Even at death he wanted to party. RIP THIEF 2014-2014
RariSwag;-;This is the perfect game to mess around with. It can get confusing when you first start, but once you get the hang of it, it has countless hours of enjoyment. Every Steam user needs to have Garry's Mod.
ToxicMuffins;-;This game is so fun i could play this everyday spawn something play on some severs play with my freind love it ive been waiting to get this game and now i have i recommend this game to all gamers:).
Jeffy;-;Garry's Mod, oh Garry's Mod, what can you say? I still miss bridge building from 9, seriously what happened? And what about watermelon racing? That was great. So any way, it's basically a sandbox game, anything really goes but there's also gamemode maps and mods. Some are as fun as putting a fork in your eye, others you will instantly love (TTT rocks!). Just beware this game attracts trolls like flies to crap.
Sergeant Blueforce;-;There are multiple games that can provide endless entertainment, but Garry's mod is probably the only one that can provide endless means to do so.
Wheaters;-;10% fun construction and creativity with tools provided and the only limit is your own creative genius, 90% batshit insanity. 10/10
Mavcu;-;It's worth it, I've played it a few minutes.
Airing Nins;-;This game is great, with much Mini Games, and always online players. I only hate that are in the beginning errors, you need to buy Counter Strike Source. I expectet that it a game was with no errors, but it's still great :D
kenx00x;-;1 of the best games i ever played i will play more for sure
Botkul /s/;-;This game is the best Indie game I have ever tried. You can do litrally anything you want. It's so fun browsing gamemodes like prophunt and TTT. I recommand this game
T-Z-UnKnown-;-;Simplest way to explain this. Every game that you could ever want. Shoved into one, modable program. That constantly gains new people. New gamemodes, and new mods. Nearly Infinite possibilities with this game. All of that amazingness. 5$. Want to play hide & seek? No problem. Gamemode for that. Want to use teamwork to uproot the badguys that want you dead? Gamemode for that. Want to Build things that use physics, then proceed to use said thing to kill countless people? Gamemode for that. Want to become the mayor of a small town, maybe be a hobo, a police officer, or even a Black Market Dealer? Gamemode for that. Maybe you want to fight zombies or even be a zombie? Gamemode for that. Or, maybe you have more refined tastes, and wish to be in control of the gamemode, or game, you can start a server. Thats right, nothing in this is hosted through steam. No random crashes from their stupid servers. Or, maybe you want to do something different? Something I didn't name? I can't possibly know, but, what I do know, is that if you do buy this game... you will most definitely get every pennies-worth of your money back, in amazing memories and friends too. Just my time playing this game alone says enough, over 125+ hours in two weeks. I give this game a 10/10. A d d i c t i n g F***ing u n Miracle e m o r a b l e
judgementhat;-;Game that trully has hundreds and hundreds of games inside, all free of charge. Including TTT, Prophunt, Purge, DayZ, etc. All are a little clunky but then again, GMOD only costs $9.99.
BiscuitTheBrave;-;I played as a cup and flopped around the map while people were shooting at me. 10/10 It's ok - IGN.
KilBlitZ;-;Amazing sandbox, hours of fun
The Dark Shogun;-;Garry's mod... Alot of you have heard of it and some have not. Now if your new to steam or would like to get a game, Garry's mod is a great game to get and it has multiple reasons too. Here are some of the reasons Garry's mod should be considered one of the greatest game on steam. Now in Garry's mod its not your tippical (If misspelled sorry :L ) Famous sometimes irratating first person shooter that everyone seems to love, its more like a mix between First person shooters, Building games and even action or adventure (With certain maps really) which I seem to enjoy more and more, Now moving onto one of the great things about it, As said erliear /\ you can download maps or weapons of your choosing like me and my brothers play this game and enjoy building things, testing them out and crashing them and then fighting some! but im loving it anyway. Garry's mod has a unlimited amount of things to so in it. But in this area im going to talk about the bad things about it. As much as the game is good it has alot of annoying or mean players or frustrating things like one for me is when you need to get something you dont want to get certain things to work like the errors, they get me mad but im not going to rant much more on a more perfect game like Garry's mod, not I hope you read my next review about Etiher (Unturned, Terraria, Payday the hiest, Team fortress 2 or hopfully Primal carnage "If i ever get it to work") END
Efrum;-;Addicting as
Oppressed Sh*t Lord;-;its the best around never ever gonna let you down!
wipeout;-;If you like random shizz, this game is for you!!!
Mr.Jamie;-;this games great but its annoying that you need loads of source games to support the graphics.
Sebastreet;-;This isn't a game. This is a lot of games in one. Also, you can be a bag of chips. 10/10
InitiatedPeak;-;Great game with no real limits
Chirpy Skittles (CHRIS);-;Great game. at first you have to figure out the controls but after play games such as cod zombies, Trouble In Terrorists Town, and much Much MUCH more. great graphics for a 5$ game.
[HSG] Dings;-;This game has everything
Gin^EnToniC_ -LS-;-;by far the most creative game :D
Happy;-;I have read the negative reviews for this game and I have to say I can agree with some points but not all. If you are going to get this, it certainly is recommended that you have CS:source for textures. Those who complain about "10 year olds in every server" do what we do: PLAY WITH FRIENDS. It's not hard get Hamachi and make your own server your rules your players no ing needed. Fact is, solo it's fun. Playing with friends in really any game-mode is fun! It's complicated building crap at first but its a fun "trial and error' sort of thing. I Love it. Like I said, if you have problem with pretweens just do yourself a favor and make your own server privately with friends. *Sidenote: Get the parkour mod. it makes the game a lot more fun. Just saying :)
Captain Sensei;-;This wouldn't be as fun without all the mods available and there's loads of them. And even without the mods it still has a lot to offer.
Man Ray;-;Garry's Mod. Well, let's see: To start off, if you have Steam, and are running it on a fairly decent computer, there's no reason you shouldn't have this game. With the flood of repetitve garbage and filth that's been on the shelf recently, and no real innovation in the video game industry, it's nice to see something like this. When I first started playing GMod, I didn't exactly see much out of it. For me, it was just a way to play something with a few friends from time to time, nothing special. But the more time you put into this game, the better it becomes. GMod is not as much a game but a community, creating things and working together to have a good time. The thing that makes GMod so great is the extreme diversity it holds. It isn't bounded by a certain gamemode, or a certain montra or anything. GMod thrives on it's community, and it isn't lacking on that at all. With a large and expanding community workshop, and dozens of modes varying from DarkRP, where you can set up drug cartels and bust criminals, to Prop Hunt, where hide and seek is taken to another extreme involving the hiders playing as actual in-game props. What other games have you played, or that have come out recently that have any kind of game model like this? None, because it isn't exactly something that you can compete with. GMod is it's own genre in that respect, making it something worth looking into, constantly on sale and only $10 to begin with. It's a wasted opportunity not to have this, and if you don't have it, you should definitely look into it.
Arthur, King of the Britons;-;Don't have it for very long but it is by far the most fun entertaining and ridiculous game I've ever played! 21/10
SirJefafa;-;The amount of hours played for me says it all.
ThexLoneWolfx;-;this is by far one of the most fun games i have ever played, ive spend countless hours in dark rp and ttt. the only con for me is the source engine which usually crashes when loading. HAVE FUN!
Ezio Auditore Da Firenze;-;its awsome me and bro get a car and a ropen and a chair and we attach it to the chair and on to the car
as Fuck;-;Not much you can say about Gmod. I like it. It's pretty cool. Everyone on Steam has it, and if you don't then you're probably new here. Look, everyone has Gmod. Don't be a lone rebel, just buy it and  around on it when you're bored.
Yugoslavia;-;Aw man this is this greatest of the games that you can ever play. Although it has many bugs and problems, it still is very fun.
best;-;I love this game
The Forsaken;-;Garrys mod a great game for everyone to play.Has good graphics lots of fun gamemodes (My favorites are zs and sandbox) and lots of things to do.even if its just shooting npcs randomly.Its really fun to play with others too.I think all my friends and everyone who gos on steam netowrk should get this game
[];-;awesome chat
Charlotty;-;Instant fun and hours of entertainment. Not a bad word to say about this game.
Rhyneosaurus;-;Out of all the games I ever played, this has got to be the most enjoyable and creative. I have so much fun playing this for hours on end because I can do whatever I want! The workshop is filled with mods that you can download onto your game and use! The mods are downloaded with a click of a buttion and, to me, the gameplay never gets old. To sum it all up...I rate this game 500 silly ragdolls out of 10.
{RET} Ya Dingus;-;This is the best steam game for making videos or just messing around with friends i would say everyone should have this game in there library !MUST BUY!
xLuCkYSnIpEsx;-;love the game
BigBurgerBro;-;OMG one of the best games i have ever played when you get bored just download some random crap :D
Scritters;-;Very confusing at first but after a while (and some youtube videos) you get the basic hang of it. For some reason i cant join servers though, so thats a downside, but still a fun and awesome game!
Unieox;-;Garry's Mod, is a sandbox game with many variations that you can add later. This game offers things such as "Trouble in Terrorist Town", were you find yourself either being innocent, a detective or a terrorist. As a terrorist you have to find yourself sly ways to kill innocents without others knowing. Detectives, find themselves using DNA scanners to see if they can find anything on corpses to lead them to the killer. Innocents are the most common and have to try not to get killed but can also kill. Also Prop hunt is another gamemode you can download. Either an object running around trying to find a hiding spot from the hunters trying to kill you... Aside from these two gamemodes there are many more. Although I have played this game a lot! It could take you hours to dowload the game, then get all the addons that servers requiere to play! Although onces getting into a lobby you like and talking to other players, you can get addicted easily. Unfourtuanatly I have to give this a 7 out of 10 for all of the time it takes to play the game.
Damien;-;Really fun and entertaining
kR. m9acle medyro;-;It's Gmod
HOG_hunt3r;-;If your looking for endless posibilities you can't look further than garry's mod this is the king of sandbox the physics are top notch the glitches (not many) are so hillarious my sides hurt after I've stopped playing and cannot possibly give this a higher recommendation it is an a amzing game and the community is actually pretty decent (wow that's a first for multiplayer games) so buy it now especially when it on special
Potato Overlord;-;This Game Is Basicly HD Minecraft.
NexuZ;-;This game described in 1 word: DERP
bananowy baron;-;lol boner manipulatoe :box:
Ludwig Von Dickhead;-;This game is like masturbating with a metal spoon! I'll elaborate:it's cold, annoying but in the end you always get that satifaction! Once I was playing this game with my sexually confused "friend" and I realised just how sh*t the servers are but after connecting it is fun to mess around amongst weird 7 year old children who need mental help. Anyway I recommend it for cronic masturbators and creepy 7 year olds alike.
[RP] MrAwkwardTurtle;-;What can one say about this game? The programming and creating aspect is like Minecraft for serious gamers. You can make anything you want if you know how to do it. The multiplayer community is honestly not very mature, but if you enjoy making jokes and being crazy over a microphone to possible terrorists and pedophiles, then buy this game. With friends, it is incredibly addictive and fun and you can choose from so many different scenarios that it will never get old. All in all, it is worth buying, and even if you don't get on public servers, you should be able to log at least 10 hours.
Lil' Medic;-;It is awesome. there are SO MANY GAME MODES. Trouble in terroist Town,Sandbox and More! It has no rules. No aims or any objectives. There is also addons and mods from TOP _ TO BOTTOM. Including New veichles,Weapons and more! There are player models from characters in Half Life 2 and more addons for thoose. Sandbox is my favorite game mode.
JustBear;-;Its fun to get kicked out of a server by a 4 year old
girrrrrrr2;-;This game is about finding the right community, once you do that, its an amazing game. If you cant find the right community, its just okay.
Thagorom;-;Very fun sandbox! You can do everything and more!
Raided-vzx;-;Very good sandbox game! It really is the best!
Twinkie Pie;-;This is a good game. Its a litle bit of everything. Their is Murder,TTT,Gmod Tower,and Sandbox. They are all fun. The community is the best part of this game without workshop this game wouldn't be fun. So you should buy it. I hope you have fun. ;)
carlos.maleh360;-;gmod is the best game ever
Wild Card;-;Garry's Mod is a very fun (and old) physics playground. I have played over 200 hours of this, and have gotten tons of user made add-ons to my G-mod toolbox to add to my gameplay experience, and I love it! Garrys Mod over-all is a very fun Physics sandbox that allows pretty much anything to happen, Excellent AI, AMAZING Physics, and over-all fun. A few bugs and things: Sometimes, the steam cloud crashes, and you temporarily lose your add-ons. Also, LAN Servers are very buggy, and it is nearly impossible to host a LAN game, even with LogMeInHamachi. There is no censor, at all, there is global voice chat on servers, so be warned. And sometimes people upload innapropriate things to the add-ons, and "Dupes" tab. A few things with physics are buggy, but very few things. Conclusion. Overall, Garry's mod is very fun, addicting, entertaining, great physics simulator, and so on... I would deffinetly recommend this game, totally worth 10 USD Although some things can be a bit buggy, if you can get this, I say BUY IT and it is a really big score if you happen to catch this while it is on sale.
VIPJOHNYGHOST;-;super fun but dont get alot of addons bucause it will crach
mribear;-;good for building. great for server fun. not so good for friendships. 8/10
hungryghost01;-;$ 3 and there are maps if you dont like building
SwagridStandards .Inc;-;this game is amazing, funny and completly awesome when in sandbox
EthanTheRanger;-;I cant stop playing this game its to addicting someone help me D:
[BH]Krypt3x;-;The only way you wont like Garry's Mod is if you put something in it that you don't like to begin with. Gmod is the best game because it's every game, ever. Whether you make maps or download others, you can play full game modes of whatever your heart desires on any map imaginable. Nothing gets better (literally) than a fully open source game (which I cringe at callng it one because it's really just a base with endless amounts of opportunities). No objectives unless you set one, and no purposes unless you build one :) Open your mind and let it run wild. 10/10
[UNAA]Deltalancer;-;This Game doesn't need a full review. In fact, it is a MUST HAVE for Steam so GET IT
fluffehkitteh<3;-;This game. Just...this game. If you want to do ANYTHING in the Source Engine, for the love of all that is good and holy, buy this game. It's $10 normal price! You can play TTT, Sandbox, Morbus, RP, and a whole load of other gamemodes, all for free! It's seriously one of the best games ever!
CrumpingGoose;-;MOST AWESOME THING EVAR
Dethklok;-;The Single Greatest #10 you will ever spend on a video game. It is a sandbox game meaning there is no objective. There is no goal. You cannot lose and you for sure cannot win. I've had this game ever since I bought steam. I've currently accumulated over 2700 hours on this game and you will find out why. Anything can be done in this game. Anything. If you were ever to buy a game in your life you would buy this. And then you would buy it for your friends like I did. Buy it, 10/10 100/100 1000/1000 This is THE greatest game ever programmed.
Ray-Q;-;Its fun cause you get to kill people on yachts and speedboats. You can fight off zombies. You can build a house with anything you want. You can have Nyan Cat gun! :D. You can build a secret base and make your car how you like it. You can go swimming and fight sharks. You can go skydiving and die. You can kill your friends :D
Redruin1;-;The sandiest-boxiest sand-box game ever made.
Mid-Air Koala;-;This is a must have for anyone who owns steam. This only adds to the experience. 10/10, plus the gamemodes are mostly great and will add hours of fun along side the sandbox mode. Would recomend.
ToothLess;-;Great game, amazing fun with friends in sandbox and with all the different game mode it make a hard to beat game
RGoodellJr;-;gmod quits out to the steam page at last second of loading single player
GospoDINO;-;THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE :DD
Masternato;-;this game is amazing you can do anything in it
SirPwn;-;this is the best game in the world, cant find anything better.
mr. big knob;-;This game the the game that everyone has, if you're a gamer you have this game and if you dont have it itll appear you wont even remember you bought it
Custard Cream;-;Great game, much fun.
Retro Man;-;Very cool game. This is a sandbox game that is infinitly customizeable with great online. Unfortunatly, if you don't own Counter Strike: Source, this probably isn't worth getting, because most addons and weapons for online requires it. Otherwise, get this with CSS if you don't have it, but if you already do, get it by its self.
haukster;-;Very good love the workshop
TeenSpirit;-;Remains one of the greatest games on steam!
Riggataly;-;This game just goes on and on
Jangokenobi;-;You can not possibly call yourself a PC gamer if you do not have this game.
SprocketPete;-;Garry's Mod is an awesome sandbox game with lots to do in singleplayer. Should you get bored, there's plenty to do online. :) A must have for PC gamers
GolfMoose;-;This game is part of my life
Jig Lee Bollsok;-;You can kill people with melons
Shrylo;-;I have been playing Garry's Mod for a while know and I just want to say it is amazing. If you like a game that has alot of gamemodes for one game this is the game. It not just one game you can do alot of  with it. It is more fun if you have friends to play it with because not all of the Garry's Mod people are nice. But other than that this is a very good game. I give it a 10/10 should buy if you got the money...
Raeverion;-;"Like Skyrim but with absolutely everything you want" -IGN 11/10
markiplier;-;its a fun game i like it, wanna be freinds?
NimNam7;-;Hillarious fun with friends and alone, lots of gamemodes to choose from. 10/10
we're all fucked in the head;-;10/10 would bang limitless game i still have no ing clue what im doing buy it
BadassBitchbangerBjrnar;-;I'm just here for The Pillar of Community-badge...thingy. Great game/10
Ametius;-;This game is fun to play alone and with friends! This is the game i played the most and i haven't regret anything. There are alot of gamemodes you can choose from. I would highly recommend this game! :3 Shoutout to my Umbrella Crew! -Ametius
Frog Dumper2;-;pretty good
Aladrew07;-;I highly recomend this game for any style of gamer. It has many difftrent game mode each so diffrent, hundrends of servers to choce from on most game modes also uses the sorce engine so any sorce game you have will add its items to it so if you have lots of sorce games you get lots of more content. :3
420Fedoras_;-;Great game unlimited possibilities! There are many, many, gamemodes. most common are TTT DarkRP Prophunt Murder Sandbox and so on. if i listed every gamemode this would go on a mile long. this game offers unlimited customization. with THOUSANDS of user created addons in the workshop. Great game to play with friends, too!
Amidza;-;Good game for having fun with ur friends and getting them  off in some mods :))
hermaN;-;As Garry's Mod is a non-campaign sandbox game, the possibilities are endless. There are so many game mode you can download and play with your friends! Only downside - I recommend getting Counter Strike: Source for the full game expierence.
[RG] Zeolis;-;One of the best games to play with or without any friends. There are almost an endless possibilities you can do as playing some of the more well known game modes such as Prop hunt, Murder, Sandbox or TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town). Also if you don't like the first server you visited there are Hundreds more and even if you tried one it doesn't mean you tried them all. I would suggest getting CSS (Counter Strike Source) because there are a lot of servers that use maps that have CSS in them and it would be a lot easier to have the game for the textures but it is not required as in there are a few servers that are non-css where ALL their maps don't need css at all.
Rashies;-;Very fun game, when your bored, this is the game to play.
Dubstep Astronaut;-;Wanna' make art, history, and much more? Get Gmod! Wanna have 10 fps per second for spawning too many props? Get G.... actually that's bad, but anyways! Get Gmod!

Wanna- Ok, you know what's next so let's just say: Get frickin' Gmod!!
TheOnlyUser;-;Garrys mod is a extreamly addictive game. it shows that any game can be popular even mods from a already existing game. not only is garrys mod a great game in single player but is growing with popularity in multiplayer with a easy way to make survers to play with your friends. it has also been liked by many youtubers showing off the newest and greatest mods of today. those youtubers showing off those mods have inspired others to make there own creations. Overall i give it a 9/10 for its superb effort to keep it updated and smoothness.
I BattleKat I;-;simply stuning especialy for those with minds of creativity
LittleBoss!;-;This game is really good. Just get it if you havent already. You will love it. :D
Manilla;-;This game will last for an eternity. The amount of amazing addons people are creating will keep this game alive for years.
MagicalPineapple;-;It makes my  tingle with delight.
14jc6065;-;Positives: 1.) Not very cpu intensive unless you make it (which I have found relatively difficult to do). 2.) Great pricing. 3.) Great for playing with friends. 4.) You can imagine it, You can build it. 5.) Possibly others I forgot about. Negatives: 1.) Can get boring in single player relatively quickly but if you have friends to play with that is an easy fix. 2.) When using the easy-weld function of the weld tool sometimes the objects will launch across the map. Nothing major with that one though. 3.) A lack of an "official" in-game tutorial but it is somewhat easy enough to figure out by reading the hints. 4.) Possibly others I forgot about. Overall: Graphics 8.7/10 Gameplay 9.5/10 Edit: Be sure to note that I did not review the community as this is meant to be a review of the game not the people who play it.
IGJaxun;-;Such a fun game so many things to do in it.
Tech;-;Great game! 10/10 pros: can be what ever you want it to be Zombie survial? got it! Roleplay? got it! flying dinos in cars GOT IT! with the workshop this game has so much potential. cons: does tend to crash. (overwolf for teamspeak cuases this for me) ((so no point reduct)) other wise good game... and if you dont like 5 yr olds screaming on mics go to mature servers and or stay away from the gamemodes "big youtubers" play.
Ichigo Dragneel;-;This game was confusing to me at first. But after I figured it out it was the best game i've ever played. Seriously if you pass this up your not the brightest. It'll keep you hooked for hours and never gets repetive. This game is a crime if you don't mod it half to death. But with the right mods and some friends gathered round, you'll have endless hours of fun. I recommend this game 12/10. Its cheap and fun. Buy it and give it a try and if its not your style, just don't play it.
TheDoctor (KOS);-;#1 game on steam
GAGETHEPYRO;-;September 7 2014: On this day in history an army of Zoidbergs armed only with crowbars attacked a legion of Colombine soliders on a rooftop. They were cut down in the name of Batman's amusement 10/10
Sena;-;I think this a great game because it has so much versitality and you do anything you want!Why not buy a game that has got so many good review?Plus it's only $10 to get, that's pretty cheap to me.
Hero of the Minish;-;I've had a bunch of fun playing this game with some friends, It's not great alone but if you've got 2-3 friends to play with you it's a ton of fun.
Flash Gordon;-;This game is a really great game to play by yourself or even if you have any friends like you would, but if you do then you can play with them in different gamemodes, like prop hunt, sandbox, and even murder, you can get add-on which make you get more thing so you can make and blow up.
2Dank4U;-;This is the best sandbox game in the world.There is many mode you wont get bored forever
Sir PengZ;-;this game is fun after a couple of games really fun if you have other friends who play it
[FL:RP] Xavier 3.10;-;Play with friends is the BEST of the BEST 11/10
F_SerapH_-;-;I love this game!
TheRealHBE;-;I spawned a FNAF Foxy NPC and it ran after me. BEST GAME PHYSICS EVER!!!!!! Seriously. If you have the money then scroll back up and buy it. I'm SERIOUS!!
Deep Toot;-;Great for trolling your friends and having a good time. THUMBS UP!!!!!!!
Bailey;-;Awsome game, totally worth the money and will run on most systems
Jaxies;-;An awesome game for people who like physics/building/or just screwing around with NPCs faces. You have freedomto do pretty much whatever, and the workshop is AMAZING! There are so many awesome maps, player models, models, SWEPS, NPCs, ragdolls, etc. Overall 10/10 for being an awesome casual game. Also, if you want something more competitive, there are gamemodes like Trouble in Terrorist Town.
Residents evil;-;Honestly, is there a way to describe this game? I can only say this: You can do WHATEVER YOU WANT. I think that is 100% enough to explain this game. Hop in a server and... well... do whatever! 10/10 Recommended!
[VALV] Tommy;-;This should be a greenlight. And for you people out there, IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE TEXTURES OR MODELS ENTER IN Right click on that steam game. Go to properties. launch options enter -dxlevel 81, for team fortress 2 -dxlevel 90 to see spawn menu Q press E and move mouse to rotate objects or ragdolls without having to jump like a monskey everywhere and its usually used in movies, of gmod. Press C top left corner to turn of the blue beams, and halo if you are trying to make a movie. its fun, you can get along with people very easily, and badges, and trading card are allso easy. So thats just stuff to refresh you memory. And i highly recommend this game like when you cannot play a certain game because youre graphics card doesnt support it, well you can just download all of that from steam workshop. P3@C3 0UT
Porsche;-;You can shoot things. 10/10
AlphaBility;-;THIS IS TE LIEF !

Grey Knight Apothecary40K;-;A good game with endless hours of fun filled with good people had more things in it then i thought it would.
TheDoctor64: MallCop;-;I made shrekspam 420/10 Amazing game GOTM (Game of the Millennium)
Kyr'ek;-;If your looking for a game full of randomness and lots of other things this is the game for you, sure for alot of content you need counter strike source but its still a wonderfull game
Snake;-;This game is everything and nothing. Create what you want or enjoy what you see.
AusForkThousand;-;It's Garry's Mod. First you start off by finding inventive ways to kill NPC's and eventually you end up with with a part-turret-part-car-part-wiremod death machine that you eventually crash the game with. Then there's multiplayer, which you can do anything from what you do in single player to running around as a cup while laughing like a maniac. Just buy this game already, you know you want to ;)
J Dog360;-;good game for building stuff and great for a party
Ahri;-;Old man in a can-Banana plane-magic train! All sorts of creepy yet awesome thiiiiings! The words for this game can't be easily expressed, seeing as the community for it is so vast in numbers. Everyday, new models and items are uploaded to the GMOD workshop for people to upvote and experiment with. Whether it be an atomic bomb, or a giant robot which shoots rockets, I can assure you that it will amuse you. The little things in life can sometimes be the most appriciated. The Multiplayer is even better than single player in my opinion. TTT being the best. Prophunt being a close second. What is TTT? It is a game mode where you are a terrorist. These guys are surprisingly innocent. However, you have to watch out for the traitors who could shoot you in the face at any given moment in time. The detectives however are on the case! With health, DNA tools that let them find the Traitor, and a variety of special weapons in some servers. But beware! The traitors may or may not have the dreaded prop cannon, or melon gun which can kill you in one hit. Now don't get me wrong, the Traitors may seem overpowered with a lot of 1-hit KO weapons, but it is all in fun. (Especially when a Traitor somehow manages to completly fail and kill himself.) My word of advice for beginners to a gamemode such as this? DO NOT RANDOMLY KILL. All servers have mods or admins who will ban you if you get on and begin to "RDM (Random Death Match)" Innocents, Traitors, and detectives. This isn't fun for others, and will likely end up with you never being able to play on that server again. I could go on and on about what is so great about this game, but I suggest that you just find out for yourself. A word of Forwarning however, it would be best if you bought the GMOD and Counterstrike source pack if you want to play TTT. There are patches to play as well, but I find it an honest waste of time. Get in, and play. Join the fun that is GMOD in all its glory.
Hoff Stiles;-;Good with friends or on lonely Tuesday nights. Best with mods. Only people with imagination should buy this.
Aggressive Otter;-;A must have for all pc gamers.
TastyCheese;-;Great game fun, the addons make it extra fun such things like cars from gta v and guns from both C,O,D ghosts and BF4
Ghost & Aeralle;-;Plz read my hours! This game has every fawking thing you want!!!!!! Roleplay=Yes Detective games= YES racing = Hell yeah! AND PLENTY MORE!!! and do i have to explain more??
StureX;-;this game is AWSOME YOU CAN SHOT THINGS KILL THINGS YOU CAN BUILD A HOUSE OR BUILD A TANK AND YOU CAN BUILD A TOILETT YOU CAN ING DO EVERYTHING ING BUY IT DC NFVDDEGFDS
Flusherboxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;-;This is just one of those games you can play for hours on end and won't get bored. There are soo many gametypes for this game for example some of the most popular at the moment are: Murder, Trouble in terrorist town, Jailbreak, Gmod tower, Sandbox, HL2 and DarkRP and many more - And there are always new gametypes being added. If you buy this game I highly recommend buying and installing counterstrike source aswell because the majority of gametypes use the skins, guns and objects from source (do this to avoid annoying error signs). You can also have alot of fun offline aswell, you can almost build anything in this game, from a speedy car to rocket ship. The steam workshop support aswell is amazing for this game, it is a breeze to download things from workshop, for example you can download cars, tools, maps and even a fully functioning dinosaur as I once did. I recommend this game to anyone looking to have good fun!
TheLoneWolf;-;Garry Mod is one of valves best games in my opinion! although you need counterstrike for some textures its one of my favorite games! i recommend it for all gamers
Wallpox;-;It's the only game that you can do everything you want, make a fort, a tower, and lots of stupidity that looks better on singleplayer.
lulu1993cooly;-;Its an okay game. I played it for a little bit and had some fun. Couldn't see playing it for very long though.
UndercoverCow;-;One of my friends said this game was boring... I have 1 less friend. 10/10 would destroy another friend with the power of the internet.
meaty;-;it's so much fun enteracting with the lively community, which is 95% 12 year-old furries in RP servers, all of which who have microphones and an affinity for fluttershy that they're happy to tell you more about.
Strawberry Fish;-;Pretty damn good sandbox game, multiplayer gamemodes for just about everything from roleplay to DayZ. Modding ability (Which is no doubt implyed by the name) is amazing. The only problem I have with it is my insane connecting time to just about any server, then again that might just be that I'm on OS X and with Australian internet, anyway, get it or Bob will kill you :)
AeroMcFly [IG];-;Garry's Mod is a game/tool worth more than the money you payed for it. You neet to have mods and know how to use it (well) to fully enjoy it.
Charlie Brown;-;its garrys mod so its awsome the only problem is havin to buy other games to have textures so basically if u only buy gmod then the game will be all eroors and no fun but if u get cs and tf2 plus half life then the game will be amazin and u will play it for ages becus of all the dif game types u can play over all its worth it even tho u have to spend around 30 pound to have textures to play everything it doesnt matter the game is fun and time will just pass by with ease if u let it so id suggest buyin it
Spongebob, Destroyer of Evil;-;Made Goro from Mortal Kombat get the Joker's head shoved up his . 8====D out of 10
General Catlysses S. Grant;-;I can make Godzilla eating a car with a cat in it, just get it and see what you can make.

LolcatPlays;-;My review Wow, there are a lot of things to say here. Garry's Mod can be good or bad depending on how you look at it, there are serious Roleplay servers, for the co-op fans there is HL2 Campaign Co-Op, no kidding. There are zany and wacky minigames to play with friends and for the creative types, there is sandbox mode! The main mode of the game, you can: Shoot each other. Trap each other. Build with each other. Become a famous youtuber like every other person in the world. Build cars and crush your enemies skulls. Get a gore mod and slice your most unfavorite characters, ever! (Like, ever.) And the list goes on.. Final Verdict This game is worth every pound/buck/euro/whatever you could buy it with! You should get it any chance you have!
40;-;Die because shooting can 12/10
PETER GRIFFIN;-;awsome game where you can download things like tanks choppers army people and a lto of other stuff. :D
Godzilla the King of Swag;-;You can be Godzilla. Destroyed Tokyo/10 ~IGN
ColoredEnergyswords;-;Garry's Mod Defines the word customization because of all the mods that shape it otherwise still a great sandbox with AWESOME games to go along with them this is truly a gem for those who want a good creative sandbox game with pretty much everything and anything able to be put in the game. however after a while it does get boring and also with pretty small inventory space so if I were to rate it I'd say 9/10
JaKobe Bryant;-;Hundreds of different gamemodes each for every different person. If you like different kinds of roleplay, Gmod's got it. If you like Team deathmatch games, Gmod's got it. If you like to spice up your life with some mystery, TTT, Murder, Prop hunt... Yeah, Gmod's got it. Do you wan't to build a rocket in a mans  and send him flying across the map with his  blaster rocket? Gmod's got it. Do you want to pit Dozens of AI against each other until the last man stands victor, whom you then fight to the death against your creation, Gmod's got it. You like making cool cinematic photos/movies, Gmod's got it. With thousands of maps to spawn wheel after wheel of heavenly cheese across every inch, until your insatiable lust for such fine cheese is won over. Yeah, we really like cheese up in this mofo. So ladies and gentlemen... Get Gmod, because it will be one of the best things you have ever done. And get CS:source because f*ck salt, you'll need it kids...
Looking to Feed;-;relly gud but my frendz always mad at me ;c
Bulletproof;-;One of the all-time great's, an absolute classic game! It has changed over the years to support community created content better. There is so much variety in this game, just a must have really.
ModelZXGiro;-;Strapped a baby Pokemon to a rocket and shot it into Godzillas mouth well flying the Tardis around it. 10/10
JakeDaDerp;-;This game is great! Its never gets old. its has alot of things to do.
Abdulrahim;-;I wanted to buy this game , but a lot of friends said it was not " a game " And yes , it isn't a game , it's your world , you can do whatever you want !
[TYD] Celine Dion;-;best game to play with friends
Xidious;-;10/10 Would play again.
Heisenbat;-;I made a rocket  and it penetrated my heart.
Orange Raccoon;-;its a sandbox editor..so you can pretty much do anything you want with the source engine, even go online and play many different game modes that the community has made, like Zombie survival, racing, even a Quake 3 Arena mod<<< now that mode took me back to the hardcore days. there's even a cinema game mode or some sort where players can get together and watch a bunch of random youtube or other video sharing site at the same time, and that was a very interesting experience in my point of view. You can pretty much do anything with the source engine nowadays. So yea, Buy this game and have fun. there's really no rules here.
Darky;-;great game and learning tool
Bruce241;-;This game is amazing, the character interaction, all the different game modes, and so much more. If you are thinking about getting this game, get it! It's totally worth the 10 bucks.
Leo;-;The Sandbox for this game is simply amazing. The number of things you can make and the creativity involved is simply astonishing. The other gamemodes for this game can turn a sandbox game into a fun FPS. TTT, Murder, Jailbreak, etc. are some of them and the addons you can add make the games even more fun. This may soon become my favorite game.
Lion;-;one of the best games on steam worth it get it and have a lot of fun my felo gamers
Unmanned;-;just buy it
Darth Raver;-;if this was a potato this would be a good potato
The_Shadow;-;Fun game if you are creative
TheOnlyDare;-;This is the best sandbox ever, with constant mods being added and various game modes you are bound to find something you love
%%%;-;Almost as Everything I Like It
%%%;-;Almost as Everything I Like It
Noah;-;Garry's Mod is the most addictive game I have ever played. I admit the graphics aren't "Next Gen" but the gameplay experience is incredible! There are hundreds of different gamemodes out there ranging from a sandbox in which you can build just about ANYTHING to Dark Roleplay in which you can roleplay as one of many different things in a town or city that is full of people playing their roles. But if you are not into building stuff or roleplaying then there are many other gamemodes such as TTT were players have to find a traitor and kill him by using a mixture of detective skills and Shooting skills and the traitor has to kill everyone before they kill him. Jailbreak in which prisoners in a high security prison can either play nice and listen to the gaurds or try to kill them and escape the jail. There are many more gamemodes (Murder, Prop hunt, Stop It Slender etc.) To sum up; Basically whatever type of game you are into whether it be horror, shooting, roleplay, ANYTHING... This game is for you. C'mon let's not forget its not really expensive either now is it? ;) Highly recommend this game.
Call me mr potato man;-;This game has almost anything you want. It also has alot of modes to play, so you can play this game for hours without getting bored for even one second. Really good game that is worth buying.
SHADYCOBRA;-;Very fun, however BUY THE BUNDLE!!!!!! You cannot play this game online without counter strike: source. Its that simple. Besides that an awesome game! Huge sandbox possibilities and crazy online game modes like prop hunt, dark RP and zombie survival. It's definitely worth the buy, just buy CS:S also!
Cory's In My House;-;This game makes me wet...
DLqSebsTheGreatThBO;-;gmod is a game where you can do anything
Nitrus SVK;-;Pretty much reason why I'm using Steam. One of the best games I ever played (even though it's a mod). The number of gamemodes and addons this has is just amazing. Must-have for any gamer that likes creativity and freedom.
President Moose;-;Ok lets be truthful here. This has to be one of the most fun games i have ever played in my life. There are endless servers and game modes and it doesnt stop there. You can mod and make your own gamemodes,Host servers. Positives: This game has so many gamemodes. This game can bring your creativity out to a new limit. If you like to Build/Rolepay/Play mini games/ Conversate This is a game for you. There are gamemodes such as dark Rp And TTT These two game modes are the 2 most well known. They are so fun and don't ever get boring. The game never stops with new stuff. The community has so many things they add all the time and it will never have a limit. Negetives: The community is one of the worst communities i have seen. It has so many people but most of them consider them selfs to be trolls. If you have a squeeky voice or do not like cussing and negetive attitude. I would turn voice chat off and type witch would be hard and ruin the game. There are some people on this game who are nice and dont care what age you are. But most of the people on this game are stuck up  who make fun of everyone and try to annoy. I will be honest there are lots of screeming 10 year olds who run around not knowing what there doing and ruining the game for everyone. So the only thing bad about this game i would say is the community Conclusion: The game itself is great you will have lots of fun and never get bored i can promise you that. So i would Definitley recommend this game. the only bad part like i said was the fact that the community tries to make you commit suicide 90% of the time. But like i said again there are nice people and the game is very entertaining. out of the 1,000 hours of this game i have played, It has been the most fun i have had on steam.
TMS;-;garrys mod is awsome theres millions of things to do and theres steamwork shop which more things added in the game and theres gamemodes like ttt, prophunt, hide and seek, darkrp and more. really fun with friens and its cheap 10/10 Awsome
kiyasakikuro;-;Everybody gets bored everyday....so this game makes you feel !@#$%^& HAPPY everyday by playing and creating weird stuff with your friends!
V-tez;-;You can do ANYTHING in this game!
[CLF3] Chlorine Trifluoride;-;If you like to build and use your fantasy this is the game for you and its also fun to play some gamemodes like ttt,rp and prophunt and you can also hangout with some friends. I give this game 10/10
tanuki;-;You can build all sorts of stuff, join other servers that have nothing to do with building any more, make a damn friend, yadda yadda. Addons by other players are pretty much 50% ported from other agmes or into garry's mod 13. Over all this game gets a yummy 8.9 out of Ten in my book
Kyle5507;-;A great game. Endless possibilities with multiplayer.
pumamster (green);-;THIS GAME IS SO AWSOME IT WILL TURN YOU HEAD INSIDE OUT(i mean it...)
Robert;-;This game is amazing, well I could say game(s) since its filled with diffrent kind of servers in which you can do different stuff like RP (RolePlaying) TTT (Trouble In Terrorist Town) and many others. I would say get this game for an amazing fun for hours and hours on end. The only bad thing about it is you should get CS:S (Counter Strike: Source) since many server need it for textures, modles and other stuff. 9.5/10 MUST GET
Grapefruits up my ass;-;made a red scout army. give me pancakes or I will unleash the secsi demons within
Kyle;-;I don't even want to think about how my life might have been changed if I hadn't bought Garry's mod when I did.
iriK;-;This is one of the most amazing games i've ever played. with tons of gamemodes and such. with over 1,000 hours.. this game will take over your life.
[d0p0]Unofficial 5 Year Old;-;Possibly one of the best games I've ever played. With the option to download so many addons and use those to your liking, the game will fit to anyone's preference. Definitely worth the price. Of course without Counter Strike: Source, you will be missing a few textures, but I don't really mind, I have fun either way. With lots of gamemodes to choose from such as sandbox, murder, trouble in terrorist town, and prop hunt, you will not get bored.
hnderNts;-;100/10 Squidwards! As you can see i have 670+ hours on this! Hours of fun in sandbox/Murder/ttt/DarkRP and all that fun stuff!!!
Fordon Greeman #RIPSatoruIwata;-;One of the best sandbox games in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE!!!
#cumg00nz;-;made my dreams come true of making a driveable scrotom. 10/10
DeathWatch;-;This game is good but the community is very terrible, and technical about everything.
dark lord chin chin;-;super fun worth $10 or wait for sale and get it for $2.50
Jawmonster;-;I love this game! Garry's Mod, a physics-sandbox game were you mess around, create a server, battle enimies, and even build creations! I still have yet to play multiplayer, but WHATEVS. I like building. I like funny games. I like messing around. I like testing stuff out. That is why my brother got me this game. This game is hilaourious. So, definately, try this game out! :D
Smth Opheliac;-;This game gives you wing boners.
Erik;-;It makes your genitals huge
RosettaStone;-;I shot a watermelon out of a cannon at a pokemon. shigeru miyamoto/nintendo
ACRemix;-;Got chased down and beaten to death by a bunch of angry citizens with overly large heads and crowbars. 10/10 would play again
2dog3;-;its friggin amazing! u download mods and the only limit is your computer. honestly this is one of the best games ive heard of in a long time
Dokie;-;Very Cool Game
Franz von Stryker;-;The game has been going for nearly 10 years, that says it all. One of the only truly open sandbox games of endless possibility, one minute on dark rp your a cop stopping criminals, the next the criminal, the next an innocent civilian on ttt, or an astronaut in spacebuild. Endless possibility, as long as you have endless imagination and the mixture of a great company and a great player base has kept this game alive for so long. Definitely worth the 10 bucks.
Epix0;-;Awesomeness....awesomeness everywhere!
freewij2;-;Everyones doing it, you should do it.
M3LLn;-;A great sandbox game for everyone, besides the fact that if you want to play other game modes or most addons you need CS:S. but bundle them together or wait for a steam sale and there ya go.

Vibe162;-;Worth. It.
[IM] ZillyTheRaptor;-;Spawned a bunch of zombies, got mobbed by them. 11/10
(Foojile) Arno Darius|GR-559;-;Spent lots of time in this its a great game I recommend the counterstrike,garrysmod pack also download Wire a great mod that is useful and many servers use it :D
Walter White;-;If you're thinking on "Yaayy Gmod, I'll be famous, videoz yay yay" you're wrong. That simple thing is the hardest thing to do on this game. But, this has a few nice gamemodes which are cool, but they get boring after a while. Is it worth the buy? Of course it is, as long as you pick it up on sale. 6/10.
[Unity] LiamJ1678;-;Probaly the best PC game i've played in a long time!
DevD;-;Garry did a great job on this one!
Gallandick;-;I play on a server and see a lesbian pornography on the wall. 10-10
|SC| Psypo;-;My friend asked me to describe this game, I asked him to think of anything, ABSOLUTLY anything. He said, 'A giant hamburger riding a triceratops whilst eating a human.' Definatly possible. 10/10 Most creative waste of time I've ever experienced.
Draxler;-;It is a great game for enjoying some friendly banter between homosapiens alike. It really grasps my life goals and makes me feel warm inside when i play it. Sometimes when I am so warm i just dont move and stare at Garry's Mod for hours on end
Redsnake;-;Its nice if you have addons and it has improwed,NICE GAME BY THE WAY
Theta ve0;-;This game is amazing, it is limitless! BATH CARS, ROLL OUT!
CookieDoughAlex;-;it's really fun and i love it
The Illuminati;-;This is a very fun game, you can do all sorts of fun things, from building a giant mech in singleplayer, to stabbing players with a knife in Gmod Murder, to killing zombies in Zombie Survival! I highly reccomend this, and you should buy it!
Georgegreece;-;Awesome, Great graphics, low price. Must have.
The Man;-;if you can think of it, you can do it
Classic Mac Demarco;-;Get baked out of your mind,play a jailbreak server and relt all the guards while taking a hit out of a bong while eating shrooms. 10/10
oandaaviation;-;Ruined My Life Lost My Wife Lost My Kids Now I Have To Pay For Child Support Great Game! 15.78/10
Bun mr.kitty is back;-;I AM NOT THE F****** TRAITOR!
Rafterman;-;This game is for austistics fagawtz and neckbeards who can't afford some ing legos. 10/10
BeYo;-;After watching some youtubers playing Prop Hunts, Murder, Trouble in Terrorist Town, and having fun with Sandbox... I was appeal to play Garry's Mod. The wild promotion appear... and I cannot resist. I have play couple of Mod so far and I have to say I got some good laught, and met some nice peoples. I will play again and more and more. Maybe who know create some stuff :) Good and amuzing. :)
||TinyKarma||;-;Sell your soul and play
galensoth;-;Very fun game where most of the time you can just  around with your friends.
Steve Harvey;-;Are you thinking about buying this game? Do it, this game will keep you busy hours. Whether it be from playing different gamemodes with different people, or with friends it's well worth your time!
<>;-;good out of 10 would do
twiggiertoast33;-;very great game, but my computer stops when i am downloading mods for the game
Piggity Pig Pig;-;Hey fellow gamers! This is Garry's Mod an amazing sandbox game. Not only is it a sandbox game, but with this game you are able to download many gamemodes and itmes such as weapons and vehicles. Yes, all for free. Well, the game isn't free but every single mod is. Not sure if you should spend the ten bucks? Well it is worth every cent spent. You can play downloaded gamemodes online or just have a private game with your friends. Truly this game is one of a kind and quite amazing one too! You shouldn't need a single word of advice now. Scroll up, buy, download, and enjoy the wonders of Garry's-Mod. Hope you enjoy this unbeleiveale game!
QuitStalinAround;-;I personally find this to be a great way to spend my time. Though it is has problems like every other sandbox (bad dupe systems, annoying server organization, incredible lag at some points), i find Gmod always brings something new to the table, as well as having a great community and many, many game types. It will definitely eat away at your time and cause a little frustration here and there, but yeah. 9/10 Okay okay. one more thing. Don't buy the damn game until Steam has one of their giant- sales on counterstrike source and Half Life 2. Otherwise it's a bit expensive, or you'll be missing a whole bunch of textures.
swedishswede;-;You can make Dr. Mossman give Eli some sugar! 13/10
REDDI;-;This game sucks cack
Sir Umi-Chan of 's;-;You can do pretty much anything in this game. 10/10 would fly in bathtubs again.
g;-;I have bought this game twice on two accounts, well worth it. I had long since forgotten how much fun it was to play out my own imagined scenarios in Big City, or just creating masses of enemy combine for me to mow down through in an epic fashion. Truly a chaotic and unrelenting expression of player freedom and imagination.
EagleSniperX;-;Huh..can't believe I haven't written a review on this game yet, well here it goes. Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. You are given the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions, there are also a large variety of game modes as well like: Trouble in Terrorist Town, where there are innocent terrorists and traitor terrorists, the traitor must kill all the innocents before the innocents find out who the traitor is. Stop Slender! Where players are to roam around a map collecting eight pages, BUT there is one player who takes control of Slenderman, his goal is to kill everyone looking for pages. There are a whole variety of gamemodes but it'll take me forever to go through them all. Garry's Mod is a fun sandbox game which allows you to do and construct whatever you like. Here's a score for what I think: 9/10 Now excuse me, I need to construct my top secret scientific titanium plated rocket ship. P.S this game includes THOUSANDS OF MODS for your enjoyment! (hence Garry's 'MOD')
dr.hug0;-;Best mod for source engine! *BEST TIME KILLER
Keenan;-;Think of the wierdest, funniest, most stupidest thing you can... You can make it in Garry's mod. 216512615/10
kaos;-;You can spawn melons. 11/10 Would buy again
Vlociti. Qewmot;-;This grame is great, REALLY worth getting. TTT is super addicting and fun, you can download some various maps to it (scary, fun, random etc.) Or you could just mess around with it, anyways just an overall great game. 10/10 would buy again.
eminem;-;I got 'ome from the bloody coal mines, turn'd on the ol' computermabob and purchased this bloody game! I bloody love it, I do! It's bloody got bloody dinosaurs! The only bloody downside is the bloody Scot who keeps stealin' me bloody coal. I give it 10 bloody Yorkshire puddings out of 10!
Bot;-;one of the most funest games i ever played
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH;-;Garry's mod is a wacky enjoyable game that can just keep getting better as you add to it. Be warned though, if you want access to all of the features garrys mod has to offer, then you are going to buy games that run off valves source engine, mainly counter strike source.
Kuziz;-;I will write this short - If you have a lot of creativity, get this. If not, get this. You will just hang around on other gamemodes. Gamemodes? Yeah, there's a lot of them. Sandbox, Role-Play, Trouble in Terrorist Town, ELEVATOR:SOURCE (my favourite).
|Lord| |jermis|;-;i have played this game for over 179 hour and im about to play it again out of all the games i have no lifed this is one of the top 3 i know i have not played for very long to some people but i love this game and on a scale of 1 to 10 im goin with 10

Meow #DYEL;-;THIS GAME IS AMAZIN ... There are watermelones... O.O
Koatick;-;its good.
Le Zurd;-;Within this game, you are a gamer, playing as your favorite video game character within some abandoned video game sanctuary. You've pretty much completed every objective of the main game, and now you are bored; you must find a way to occupy/entertain yourself for the remainder of your precious free time here in the universe. --With this, I find it to be no surprise that we humans have come to thrive with life in such desolate, austere environments; as we have within the confines of our reality here on earth. We, like the players, within this indolent game we call life, start from nothing, and sprout out of the vain emptiness with life, like wildflowers after rain, and make amazing things with our tools as human beings. It is with this simple sandbox game that we humans are able to truly contemplate the reality of our ingenious resourcefulness and the fullest extent of our creative capabilities, as we, like artists of blank canvasses, create astonishing works out of nothing, finding valuable amusement within the vain emptiness of the blank slate that is what life is to be, and is what this game is to give the user;
KyleTheGerman;-;This game is so much fun with friends, there is almost an unlimited amount of entertainment you can get from this game.
super ghetto man;-;Awesome storyline
[TMW] Dr.WOLF;-;This game is awesome even though it has some little glitches but with thos gamemodes and mods for download this game is AWESOME! .... So I recommend this game for players that like creating stuff, action, horror and stuff...... :)
Predator;-;This is a very good sandbox and adventure game.Its like you can do anything on there,I really recommend it!
The Man Egg;-;This game is beast.
TheNarwhalKing;-;You can turn yopur friends into water melons and capture them in poke balls that by itself is enough to get this game
Doc Xero;-;I love it 9/10 would pose again. :3
Tresdentiah;-;pretty good i guess
I AM A BUTTERFLY;-;Very Fun and Addictive game, All Should Buy It!
GuyWhoDoesStuff | trade.tf;-;Kill terrorists while shouting in your microphone "KOS POOPYBUTTFACE" or crash your computer with addons
Angie. P @America;-;Awesome game really enjoy it! reccomend it!
VrtX;-;dont read the comments section.. just buy the game! XD
DRSHERLOCK;-;GarrysMod is a fun sandbox game built upon the half-life games. It has fun physics to play around with like sending your friend to space with a turbo chair. As it was built apon Half-Life it comes with all the items, weapons and car/boat. The game is fun with friend and has meny gamemodes. The workshop is full of mods at just a click away. I would recommend this to all my friends because come on my name is fricking DRGMOD100.
xXx_MLGCntSl4y3r420BlazeIT_xXx;-;Awesome game i suggest it to all players
Byakurani Agogo;-;If you guys dont have a care in the world for getting this game, there is something seriously wrong with you.
HD_K4ss;-;Best sandbox game what i have played. So many cool and fun gamemodes 10/10
eioller12;-;cool
Spudicus: The Potato DJ;-;I love this game!!!!
Markie likes Spiky Hugz;-;THIS IS ING AWESOME! :D
Mr Andrew Bobsworth Jr;-;Not much by itself, but once you download add-ons and gamemodes, one of the most addictive games on Steam. I highly recommend.
Black Dragon Sol;-;Given most of the time, a player's creativity, the allowance to make your own gamemodes and mods to this game, even maps, NPCs, Weapons, and even those with special functions, events, and coding. It's entirely up to the player's creativity to how much this game would yield it's worth. You create your own world in this game, or you play others' creations. This is what some would call, the greatest Sandbox to have. And in most cases, they're right. 'cause I end up preferring this game more than another well-known Sandbox named Minecraft. I've still yet to get bored of Garry's Mod.
3000 protein calories;-;never play on taco nbanana it sucks
DaFlurd;-;Garry's Mod is one of the best games ive ever played in my life! Ive been playing this game since 2008 I think. I cant really remember. But I know I have played it a  ton, and I recommend you to get it. There are always new mods, addons, map, etc, made by the community. The people who play this game put hard work into making this game even more enjoyable. This is why it never gets boring. The community keeps adding on to it, to keep this game up and running. Also, lets not forget those people who deal with keeps up with servers. This is a community based game. Where you dont have to pay for stupid things like exspanion packs, news maps, people make it for free. Anyway, enough about the people who add on to the game. The community of players who play this game, is the straight definition of, "The Internet." The people who play this game are random, funny, and will make you laugh your  off (the people who have been playing a long time atleast.) Players are always coming up with things to get others hyped up, and having a good time on the game mod that they are playing on. Now those were the main things I love about Garry's Mod. P.S: IF YOU DONT HAVE A SINCE OF HUMOR, ARE UPTIGHT, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. DONT PLAY THIS GAME. UNLESS YOUR STAYING IN SINGLE PLAYER.
Flower Power;-;Don't lie, you're here because of Seananners.
Polandball;-;Very good game, they should add a little bit more to the workshop of some stuff but besides that this is my favorite PC game!
tufus11;-;Anyone craving creativity well buy Garry's Mod! Its a fun and charming game and can do what no other game can do (as of 2014) and plenty of other game modes to keep you busy for hours but if you truly want to like this game in sandbox set up a project if you dont you wil probably get bored in the first five minutes. I hope this review helped!
swagfella;-;spent 1,540 hours downloading all the addons for a TTT server, 5 mins in i get banned for "RDM" best month of my life
Penisher;-;Sometimes I sit there wondering about my well being. So I build a treadmill in garry's mod and run with a bowl of chips on my lap

VeteranRanger;-;Its like a great way to like... You know? Build stuff..
kulazack;-;It is honostly one of the few sandbox games where no matter what you can still have fun.
Pandi;-;AMAZING GAME.. There are so many ways to play.. So many things to do... Over thousands, maybe millions of players...! constant updates.. Even the community can add stuff to the game... AMAZING, You can play for 100's of hours and not be bored even thousands. Over 100's of gamemodes even! This game is worth it!
Farquaad;-;Log on. Steam. Garry's Mod. Play. Create an epic battle scene. Reset map. Build a Robot car. Log off after a few hours. Repeat. This game is great. Depending on how you use it. The thing is that it's all yours to play with. Anything you can imagine, you can create. That is just how this game works. Thumbs up for Combine Soldiers!
QuackofDoom;-;This game is awesome! You should really play this in your free time. With mods, you can do almost anything!
Magic Gonads;-;this game is verry good ING GET IT
PL;-;one of the most enjoyable games/ mods in history (or atleast my history) of gaming.
Feeeed Me;-;eight out of eight
PeterIvan2851;-;This game is highly recommended for everyone who likes to play Valve Games, Nothing is impossible to be made at Garry's Mod make everything, cars, catapults , rockets , EVERYTHING! If you're feeling to bored to play alone check out the awesome Gamemodes on other servers! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SUCH FUN WOW
z3eem;-;Simple sandbox game in where you make or play anything you want. Spawn some ragdolls and glitch the  out of them, rdm people in ttt and even crash your game. 10/10
AOT2000;-;It's fun to play it. you can do things that can be awesome.
MafackaXx;-;You simply can't live without this!
CyborgTiger;-;This game is just amazing you can litteraly do anything that comes up into your mind. You can shoot someone in the head with a melon thrower, play some Trouble in Terrorist Town, or hide as a Prop in Prop Hunt. If you whant to Role Play just go onto a roleplaying server, if you feel like being/killing aliens you can do that too. Anything that pops up in your mind could be done, wanna play some Angry Birds but don't feel like getting your phone, just build a 3D version of Angry Birds and throw some birds! This game deserves everything you can come up with. Play long and imaganative! *Spock Hand sign*
MisterGamerism;-;Fun game to mess around with friends
Milla Trotta;-;I really love this game! There are many possibilities of game mods, and all these are awesome!
GarryLazerEyes;-;Love this game
Shenandora;-;I don't know why this game exists but I love every second of it... Garry's Mod was recommended to me by friends and despite being put off by it's rather vague description of a sandbox game where you have to download more things in it and it's somewhat wacky screenshots, I caved in, sold all of my Team Fortress 2 items and bought it. And I've not regretted it once. This game is difficult to grasp there's no denying that but when you join a public server and see a load of Half Life characters flying around the map with big blue laser guns attached onto Team Fortress 2 props and characters and then get a message that the server has crashed, think to yourself how much fun people are having with this game. It does exactly what it claims. It gives you the tools and leaves you to play. And ANYTHING can be done in this game. You can have a battle with another player, make a Horseless Headless Horseman sit on a sofa and watch TV, dangle Dr. Isaac Kleiner from a Mann Co. crane or even slaughter Teletubbies while escaping the clutches of Freddy Fazbear and friends on an Imperial Star Destroyer. There are no limits.....until the game crashes. Which WILL happen. So be mindful of what you spawn in. This game takes patience. Lots of it. So give it. There's no telling what monstrocities or works of art you might end uo making. Just find a friend of someone willing to expain it to you or even make your own discoveries in this magical world of Balloonicorns, Vortigaunts and Metal Gears.... 10/10
Leatherman;-;10\4 ths es the bist geme in mie hole lif
rawr #TinyArms;-;You have to have this! It is really fun and has a lot of gamemodes to play!
thefifthbeatle9;-;This game is like entering the Haunted Mansion; "There's no turning back now." Also a ghost will follow you home.
DeltaSlugPunch;-;Ok. Open the game thinking of doing one thing and 10 minutes later find yourself doing something totally irrelevant to what you were origionally going to do and than wonder what you were gonna do when you got on.......GARCEPTION Also it is a very fun game but its even better with a friend

Patmow;-;Somtimes things can get gay......... Jk if you took this like a real review you made me laugh
The Lone Gamer;-;Garry's mod is a creative singleplayer and multiplayer sandbox game. You can do a lot of things, from making fantastic working machines to just having fun by posing ragdolls around. What i really love about garry's mod is that you can download over 150,000 mods, weapons, ragdolls, skins, maps, the list goes on and on. When you start garry's mod, you can either do singleplayer, where you can choose a map to be in and make stuff, and do a ton of other things. or you can do multiplayer, where you can grab a few of your friends and play on a sandbox server and have fun together. Or you can find new friends and go play prop hunt, or trouble in terrorist town, or a lot of other game modes. I would recommend this game to pretty much every creative person, or even people who just want to blow stuff up. There is so much to do on garry's mod, that you won't run out of things to do. There's constantly new add-ons to get. Well, i hope this review helps you choose whether or not you want to get this game or not. If you find this review helpful, please leave a thumbs up!

scwishyfishy;-;this is one of the greatest sandbox games i have ever known, the freedom of making structures, and letting others use them, using many modeling and coding skills to make addons and gamemodes. i'd say its 5 star
Boot Man Bill;-;You can get an addon that switches the voices of zombies with the voice of Danny the Tourettes Guy. 10/10
Walo;-;Nuclear Watermelons Need I say more?
BlueBreakerXD;-;Garry's Mod is a game where you can create anything you want. You want to create a rocket that will launch you into the sky and eventually die in an explosion, YOU CAN! You want to create a battlefield and start a war between NPC's? You can do that too! The game comes with a TON of different things to build and create with, but with the Steam Workshop you'll never run out of things to build. And I'm only talking about the Sandbox gamemode. There's Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt, DarkRP, and a whole lot more! Basicly if you get this game, you'll never be bored!
NSA_Jesus;-;This game is possibly the most fun you can have. Building, flying, driving, fighting, destroying, demolishing, crashing, and many other verbs are possible in this wonder of a game. 10/10 in all respects

Vault Boy (QWB);-;This game is a lot different than most games. It basically revolves around mods. There is no story, but the possibilities are endless. I highly reccomend this if you like games that aren't revolving around a story.

=ACG= A Dank Meme;-;Garry's Mod is a game worth playing if your the type to create things or to just blow  up. It serves as a great suggestion to making videos or to create something funny. I played the game, I installed add ons and it makes the game a huge success in it's years. This game also includes good quality multiplayer from over 100 modes you could choose. Some of these modes even simulate things that can happen in real life. Overall Garry's Mod is not just an average Hl2 makeup it's actually something worth checking out. I'd give it a 8/10.
