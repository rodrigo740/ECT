Revan The Wounded Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

TURBOSKILL;-;It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

shr00d;-;I'm bored and have slow internet. Might as well make a review. I don't even know if this IS a review. > spends 1 hour writing this > nobody reads > :c Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a pretty great game. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- First things first, the basic rules. In CS:GO , you have the choice to play five official gamemodes: -Arms Race -Deathmatch -Demolition -Casual -Competitive -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Summary of gamemodes: In Arms Race, the player gets weapons not by the money, but by killing people. Each two kills get you a new weapon. At the final stage of the weapon, you will get the Gold Knife. Kill someone with it, and you win. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Deathmatch, yes. In Deathmatch, it is like a "warm-up" or "practice" mode. For me, at least. In this gamemode, you join a server, and you just kill everybody you see, except your teammates. You can get weapons for free. There are also random occasions in which the game will tell you that a weapon currently has bonus points, and if you want to use that particular weapon, you press g by default. The person who gets the most points, wins. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So next in the list, is Demolition. It is set to be a 5 vs 5 match. It also has 20 rounds. The first team to get 11 rounds wins, and it can even finish with a tie. In the first half, you play as a set team. In the second, you play as the other team. You cannot buy any weapons, but instead, you get weapons by killing people, just like in Arms Race. Money is also not rewarded. But this is different: let's make a scenario. In (Round 1), you kill an enemy. the weapon will be rewarded to you on the next round. But what if you kill two in one round? You still get to advance to the next weapon, but you get a bonus grenade. For example: 2 kills: next wep + bonus grenade 3 kills: next wep + 2 bonus grenades Get the pattern? Yeah. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- What next? Oh, yeah. It's Casual. Casual is a 10vs10 game, with 15 rounds. The first team to get 8 wins, wins the match. It is split into two sub-gamemodes: Bomb Defusal (IIRC), and Hostage. Sorry, I don't know the exact names. In Bomb Defusal, there are two bomb sites. A and B. The Counter-Terrorists always have the Defusal Kit equipped, even if they didn't buy it. The kit shortens the defusal time from 10 to 5 seconds. The terrorists can freely choose which site they want to plant in. The bomb, iirc, has a 45 second timer. When defusing / planting the bomb, it makes a noise. Of course, the CTs are trying to stop them. Counter-Terrorists can win in two ways: killing all of the Ts before they plant the bomb, or defusing the bomb. For the terrorists, it's the same: killing all of the CTs, or making the bomb explode. So in Hostage, the roles are switched: the terrorists are now the defending side, and vice-versa. As the gamemode says, the Ts are holding some people hostage. And it is up to the CTs to get the hostages, or kill all of the Ts. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Finally, competitive. The competitive gamemode is much like the Casual gamemode, except a few differences: - Each kill has 2x more money reward than in Casual. - Defusal Kits / Rescue Kits cost money, and they don't get equipped automatically for free. - It's a 5v5. - Competitive has 30 rounds. - Each half has 15 rounds, and in both halves, you get to play as CTs and Ts. - Like the Demolition Gamemode, the match can end in a tie. - People are much more serious. -  blyat -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So, here is my thoughts. CS:GO offers a large variety of gamemodes, and you can just see that I've written about all of them. Phew, that took a lot of time. Anyway, CS:GO is a very entertaining game, and each match has a different experience. Yes, CS:GO can be a bit too serious, but it is also a fun game. The community is not just a single person, you know. There are people who don't like you, and some don't care, but some will make your day better. GO is a game with a high skill ceiling. There is a huge learning curve to go in this game. It's like chess. Easy to learn, hard to master. I've met a huge amount of my friends in CS:GO, and I still talk to them. Some, I don't. Yeah. They'll be grumpy at times, but they inspire me. There are some bugs in this game, but not too gamebreaking. Just a few small ones. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you have  internet. Ping matters. I hope you know that CS:GO is available for consoles, too. In fact, VALVe talked about having cross-platform multiplayer, but that would be unfair for the console players, cause they have a delay in controls. I am 100% sure that VALVe completely abandoned Global Offensive in the console. The competitive scene is pretty huge, too. And a tournament even reached more than a million viewers! Online and in the tournament itself. It's only two years old, and it's already a big game. VALVe may not be the most listening, but they try. Except sometimes they make some aspects of the game turn to . Like the AWP. They reduced the movement speed while scoping. There are also skins in CS:GO. Some care about it, some don't. Just a matter of personal preference. I think they're part of why this game is popular. The most negative opinion I have, though, is about the Competitive gamemode. Sure, "no game is perfect", and the real fun is there, yeah, but the banning system needs some stuff to be taken care of. You know, just a few tweaks, like forgiving a person if he accidentally kills someone. It is pretty unforgiving. For who doesn't know, you can get banned for killing a teammate too many times, or leaving the game. If someone abandons your team, you can surrender. Not permanent bans, though. The VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) System also needs some fixing to be done. Some cheats aren't fully detected, so the hacker doesn't get VACed. From my experiences, I still haven't encountered a hacker, but that's probably because I'm a Silver. Some people can be real s. So that's my review. Hoped you like it! EDIT: I missed a few points, thanks > SKaREO About the netcode of CS:GO, truth be told, it HAS been really bad... for a few weeks now in fact. I go up to a guy and spray him, but most of the time it registers 2 or 3 hits out of 8 for example which could be lethal. Take note, that's in close quarters. No, that's not horrible aim. In the words of a truly horrible player, "omfg 64-tick sucks volvo pls 128-tick". Eh, doesn't really suck, just... well, mixed? In Global Offensive, there are a few advantages. Some on the T side, and some on the CT side. Hm, what's it called? Yeah, the perspective. Take this for an example, the "left shoulder advantage". | http://i.imgur.com/kVpjg.jpg?1 | Here's an explanation: the player models hold guns on the right side. Therefore holding angles or peeking with left shoulder is more favorable as your model is less exposed. TheWarOwl has this video to make advantage of your perspective: | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e8HZqF3cyk | And that's well-- unfair. Just like in real life, should I see your eyes, you will see mine, too. As I said earlier, VAC needs some fixing. It's terrible. But again, I still haven't played with any cheaters, so I can't fully review this part yet. Thanks. Final conclusion: an EXCELLENT game. There's bugs and glitches, but it's a fine piece of work. Go get it if you haven't already have it. Already do? Well what're you doing reading this review? Go play! BTW: CS:GO has gotten an update where the voice chat quality has improved. Thanks valve!

Quit.;-;I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.

.Erin.;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive Counterstrike is a game that slowly ravages and pulverizes your soul each and every time you play it. Everyone starts with the same thoughts when they play CS:GO: 1) 'Pfft. I'm never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys, that's stupid' 2) I'm never going to get that angry, it's only a game. 3) 'Meh, doesn't look that hard' Within a month - Within a week - 1) Youve already have bought a P90 module skin because "Oh, It's only 30p" and you begin your slow downward spiral into the CS:GO marketplace, saving up for a knife and opening crates, in hopes of getting a knife which (deep on the inside, deep deep down) you know you're never going to get, and end up spending 10 opening crates, and getting back 50p worth of skins back. 2) Youve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives; its a game that can turn any lovely human being into a soul eating behemoth within minutes of a match starting. Get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity. 3) You'll already gave uninstalled the game at least twice, in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game. But you can't, you'll always go back. The community is utterly merciless and beastly, with over half the people being angry 12 year old Russians. The betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins. And the trading is completely unreliable, leaving you to deal with steam support, which is 10x more brutal than the game itself. But of course youll go back, its CS:GO, its a drug. A soul destroying, mind numbing, murder spree inducing drug.

3kliksphilip;-;CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.

Chaz;-;I came to this game for my fetish of chickens. When playing the game, I realised that not every map has chickens on it, so I slowly got angrier with the game... The lack of chickens boiled my blood. CSGO made me angry, Until, I found my dream love, Deathmatch. A Chicken on any map, right then.. I'd kick the bots, and chase the chickens around for hours. Ah, It was so pleasurable, How I would do it for hours on end. The chickens are perfect. I play this game for hours on end, and the chickens never disapointment me now, Oh Chickens, how you are my one true love. I can't focus at school anymore.. I only think about chickens, on the way home from school there is a KFC, I walk past it every day, I think of chickens, One time, I literally stopped, and took a fap to one of the chickens. Ah, It was so good. Chickens I love them Oh Chickens THANK YOU GABEN 5/5 I love chickens.

Reach Gold Nova 1 to make fun of silvers 5. Call everyone who is less skilled than you a filthy casual and a silver 6. Tell everyone who is more skilled than you to stop toggling and to go on a VACation 7. Steal your mum/dad's wallet and buy a knife and say you unboxed it. Optional University/College funds 8.

Garuda;-;When I was young, tragedy struck my neighborhood when a bomb went off in a local park. I lost my dear uncle in that accident. Along with my pet cat, two hamsters, one very courageous gold fish, my tickle-me elmo doll, and all of my foil Yu-Gi-Oh cards. It was the first time I experienced tragedy and despair, feelings that cut so deep I vowed to exact revenge upon whoever did this. I trained every day, running 25 miles a week, lifting weights in 15 pound increments, taking protein supplements as well as spending the majority of my weekends at the firing range. I enlisted in the military, only to be turned down because I was "only a kid." Then, I discovered Counter-Strike;Global Offensive. A perfect simulation of the events I wanted to prevent and take action upon, I was hooked immediately. I threw away my running sneakers for wool socks and sweatpants, as well as a swiveling chair. I put down my weights and protein supplements for Taco Bell and Instant Noodles. I stopped visiting the fire range and instead purchased a Razer gaming mouse. Worth. My uncle's still dead though.
will be back on tuesday;-;All features ripped from Hello Kitty Online. 4/20 -Volkswagen
SkyCuboid;-;This game has been planned perfectly. Gabe's plan has worked perfectly. I have unboxed around 3,400 cases so far and gotten 12 knives. I have spent around $16,000 on this game so far and still play like . I have played over 300 competitive matches and am still a Silver. Every matchmaking team I get is a team of Russians who like saying "" and have a grudge against Obama and have a microphone that sounds like a cat trying to gargle shards of glass. I will keep on unboxing cases, playing like a handicapped person, stay on Silver and keep buying expensive skins that apparently are supposed to make me better but don't. Because after all, Gabe is love, Gabe is life. Update 5/31/2015: For all those who didn't catch the sarcasm, everything besides the unboxing/spending money part, is an exaggeration. I'm actually an LEM, and I have in fact unboxed more than 3,500 cases (Feel free to check out my YT Channel for that).
Mr. uLLeticaL;-;Must buy if you love FPS games! This game is all about personal progression, since it comes with a high learning curve, it's not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun. It's about you, that has to learn. The game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, Match Making is great when you are playing with friends. The real game for people that love to play competitively, with a team or just solo. There are also casual game modes available for the people that don't like to play competitively, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, Hostage and Defusual missions which can be played on casual style, or mostly known as public or community servers. These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play. Pros. Match Making.  Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level.  Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments.  The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard.  Most old maps from CS, are in the game.  No perks and other unnecessary clutter.  Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch!  No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic. Cons. Match Making 64 tick servers stability could be improved.  Game could use some optimization here and there.  Cheaters now and then, but that's online gaming for you. RiP Desert Eagle, as we once knew it. If you are looking to improve your aim skills, try out these maps. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=330746573 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=379868494

NO, MOM, I CAN'T PAUSE, GTFO;-;I only got this game because everyone literally forced me to get it, so I got it, I played it. It was good in the beginning, until I started playing competitive, and why is that? Well as I walked into my first competitive match, I got into a match with 4 Russians on my team, and enemy team consisted of 3 Russians and 2 Americans that only spoke Russian. When the game started I walked 4 steps towards mid and got instantly sniped through doors, and that was a teammate! My team lost half their players before we met the enemy...So after that game I came to the conclusion that all the Russians wanted was to  my blyat. Pros: +Great maps, especially when they're filled with Russians! +I got A+ in Russian after owning this game for a week. +I can now insult my friends in Russian because they don't understand ! +I finally fit in(This review is more about my life than the actual game) Cons: -Russians, duh -Russians with guns! -democracy!!! -Screaming Russians -Not enough Russians I wonder how many dislikes I can get by saying this?

Scrubing;-;You can shoot people and stuff it's pretty fun I guess. Though one time a Russian dude said I smelled like cucumbers and it was very offputting.

Mushipo;-;I don't know what to say about this game, so here is a recipe for pancakes, Ingredients: 4tbsp plain flour (about 100g) 1 large free range egg  pint semi-skimmed milk + water (about 300ml -  milk  water) Pinch of salt Butter for frying How to make pancakes: Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture. Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix. In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter. Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps. Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth! Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt. Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later. Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over). Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!

Ojab;-;I almost died once.
DeatH_D | ETF2L.org back 31st;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive, the remake of the classic CS games and not to our surprise, the devs did a good job. One of the lovely things about it, that of had not been kept I seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently, it keeps the mechanics from the classic CS and CS:S and adds a few of it's own, that the original CS and CS:S games could have done with. CSs weak point was always the graphics, the original games were based of the HL1 engine, which I am sure all you are aware is reasonably old, although its added a new range of updated maps, including two operations. The most recent being Operation Bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as DLC. And once again, Valve have decided to take the generous approach to this, an example is that if the lobby leader has the Operation Bravo pass, and no one else does, everyone can play Op. Bravo, good job Valve, you did it again. What was missing/wrong with this game has been fixed by Valve, which is fantastic. Items have been added, you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature, although many think it's turning into TF2, which is a valid point, but Valve need there money, if you take a look at the price of the game, its not exactly the same as COD (ew) which has a hefty price tag of 40 ($60 I think) and CSGO managed to do fine at 12, which I think is $15 in the US. Sadly I did not play the original CS, I have however obviously seen gameplay, and watched friends play it. I have played a small amount of CS:S and compared it to CSGO, which was considerably easy, some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games have/had have been completely eradicated from CSGO which is brilliant. Such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games, such as the saving mechanic. In CS if you die, you lose all your weapons, they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup, players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies, so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around, the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this, and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion, it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and youre still alive you simply gain $0. The CSGO match making system is an exceptional feature, the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against, and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other. Matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank. Here are all the current ranks available in game. http://www.pro-hl.com/images/prohl/csgo_ranks.jpg Many people seem to think that this is like COD, you simply rank up from playing the game, no this is not true. You rank up as your skill improved, if you play well for a few weeks, and you finally get the Gold Nova youve been wanting for ages, and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly, its for the best, you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level. Recently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game, this is in now way ground breaking its been done by other games before, but they have there issues, although I have not got round to actually trying out this feature I have been told that it appears to be working considerably well. The watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful AWP shot, or got that 5-kill ace. I would like to say in this final paragraph, of the 250 hours+ I have played of this game I have seriously enjoyed (almost) every moment of it, sure there are some hackers, but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with. All the factors about this game are good, but as all games go by, they have there problems, sure if CSGO has improved graphics that would be nice, and if *breathes in heavily* VALVE WOULD ADD 128 TICK MATCH MAKING SERVERS this has caused some annoyance for me in match making, if you dont understand whats so bad about 64 tick, I suggest you watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6u26YTpIF0 Anyway, I highly suggest you buy this game, apart from my small rant at the end, and game is fine, good game mechanics, graphics are sort of good, I supposed most of the maps are well balanced, there are a few that I suggest you shouldnt play though. The game has a small price tag, which I am sure will attract you to it even more, especially when its on sale at 75% of! Hope you enjoyed reading my game review of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not. I would appreciate it if you left a comment about what you thought about this, was is a bad review? Why was that, whats wrong with it?
Googy;-;Once upon a time on de_inferno there existed a single chicken on A site. "I must get to my family!" said the father chicken. Navagating through all the stained karambits and battle-scarred asiimovs will prove quite the challenge. As the chicken creeps up the stairs into apartments he sees the glass shatter in the first room to his right. He scatters down the hallway anxious of what will happen next. There are 3 mysterious people wearing potato sacks on their head and must have applied way too much eye shadow. He sneaks past them and makes it into the crawlspace. "I can't believe it! I may actually live to see my family on B site fishing in the koi pond." AWP shots are being exchanged down the middle of the battlefield and the chicken hears flowerpots shattering here and there. As he gets to the exit of crawlspace he sees another potatosack creature hiding behinds a haystack and scuttles down into banana. "Who the hell drove a taxi down here?" says the chicken. He makes it down the dark ally and glances over to see the remains of his family. They are but feathers floating in the burnt sushi in the pond after a thrown molotov. "I.. I.... I can't belive thi-BOOM-." A cheeky CT sits in his spawn with an AWP as he giggles in his chair after murdering the poor creature in cold blood. Please, I beg of you, these chickens are endangered creatures and risk thier lives to venture through the city just to meet thier family again..
default;-;I can finally add 900 hours of baby sitting autists to my resume. EDIT 2: 1,100 hours. Somehow my smurf is a higher rank than my main. My main is stuck with autstic teammates that don't understand basic gamesense (MG2) and my "smurf" (LE) is against hackers. Buy a game which the devs actually play their own damn game. EDIT: For best experience smurf or queue with 5 people.
Voodoolala;-;I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons. Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun. Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more? CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience. If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades. Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.) EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins. ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches. Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers. At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches. @Shadowdance You're welcome. You gave me the push to write this reply. Cheers fellow comrades.

[HAN] BotA Nu:B!!!;-;Last Update Goodbye, CS:GO. You really helped me a lot on English : ) and buried me with "Silver II, the Nu:B" on my tombstone. -------------------------------------------- Update 17/02/2015 Hey my foreign friends. Have fun in the Chinese Lunar new year! May the goat or sheep bless you and have a safe and sound 2015. Update 1/31/2015 400 hours and I'm still Silver 2. ------------------------------------------- Last Update before Christmas: Kids are lovely. "Carry us harder," he screamed. However, I'm just a lucky silver 2 with swag-7 and pro90. I tried my best to give him the Christmas present, but I failed. So sad. ------------------------------------------ Update something about racism. Well....as an Asian, I encountered lots of racism assaults during the gameplay. I would just simply mute the racist and report him after the match, cuz I play this game for fun and practicing English, not arguing with other players... Fortunately, most people are friendly and are willing to learn new things about Asia. Don't regard all the jokes as racism. I also made some friends online, people from East Europe, State people and Canadians. Hope the world can develop in peace and go hell terrorism! Yes, that refers to you, ISIS. Go hell. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prefer it to Rising Storm, because it has a crosshair. Prefer it to Tomb Raider, because I don't have to aim by holding R-mouse. Prefer it to Call of Duty, because I would know how I died. Playing CS:GO is a good way to practice English. Not suitable for foreign youngsters, because I learned lots of four letter word from this game.

Why not Zoidberg?;-;At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses. The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer. The game is simply tactful; its brilliant when youre alive and even when youre dead the game is still fun to watch other players. Global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have created You will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself. This game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself.
creamlen;-;- community is trash - 87 percent of the players are thirsty virgins - vac security sucks balls - as a female/girl, if you talk to your microphone in-game, that means you are an 15 y/o kid, or a fat girl - 98 percent of the players don't know how to jump on the silo -  K/A/D means that you are one boosted  10/10 would cheat again
Blitzendegen;-;Chased a chicken for 30 seconds just to have an enemy player kill it. 9.2/10 would run after chicken again.
The Lust of Ass;-;Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No *t perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes. If you want to win in Counter-Strike, you have to learn the maps, play smart, and have fast reflexes. Since you work for each and every kill, it's much more satisfying than other current gen shooters.
HOTSHOT;-;I haven't played much to be able to fully review it, sadly... However, from what I've played, I think the story's about a bunch of high-school students with sunglasses wanting to blow up a courtyard in a desert while the government spends billions of dollars funding the police with all the Karambits and AWP | BOOM 's they want in order to "take'em down, easy peezy lemon squeezy" (direct quote from an interview I did...). I think it's all because of some sort of rivalry due to an anual chicken chasing contest...

Corinthian;-;If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place. Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Vancouver;-;Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.
Kozlon;-;The spiritual successor to "The Secret of Monkey Island" (titled cs:go) is one of my personal favourite point and click adventures of all time; wether it's the engaging puzzles or intricate story, this game is always sure to provide hours upon hours of family friendly fun. the game's premise is that you're either a "CT" or a "Counter-Troublemaker" who's job is to stop the "T's" or "Troublemaker's" shenanigans, such as graffiti, egging houses, or the such. All these are of course now animated, comparative to the simplicity of "The Secret of Monkey Island". All in all, a great game and tons of fun. But it's kind of a rough port, and i'd reccomend purchase on ps3. 8/10

Ack4orge;-;Date of Review: 9/27/2014 CSGO is a competitive team based shooter with highly refined mechanics The Good: (+) Gunplay is based on skill. Knowing how to control the rifle is the difference of winning or losing a gunfight. (+) All weapons are balanced in the sense that they each have a time, situation, or role that they should be used in. (+) Movement is fluid and precise and if mastered, can give you a competitive advantage. (+) The competitive maps have been tweaked specifically for competitive play in mind. (+) Competitive isn't the only game mode. There are also community servers which host a variety of game types that are fun and interesting. (+) Game overall takes skill to do well. It's not so easy to learn, and very difficult to master. This makes it pretty addicting when you're trying to improve your skills in the game. The Bad: Honestly, there's not really anything negative about the game in my opinion. But I'll just address the common complaints of CSGO. (-) CSGO is hard. Seems like every bullet misses when you're aiming right at the guy. (This is where you would take the time to learn the game, but otherwise a common complaint from people.) (-) Hit-reg is messed up. I always see the blood splatter but it never counts as a hit. (This is just a problem with the default 64 ticks server. You can join other servers with 128 tick to get better hit-reg anyways. It's still better than the 10 or 30 tick rate that Battlefield and Call of Duty has though.) Well that's all the good and bad I could think of for CSGO. Ack4orge Rating: 10/10 Perfect With the perfect tweaks to the gunplay, maps, movement, and gun balance, it refines the already highly refined gameplay of the past Counter-Strikes that's been out since 1999, making this one of the best competitive team-based first-person shooters on the market.
Threum`NINJA.HEAVYHITTERS;-;The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? "Oh im just smurfing.." You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being "smurfing" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY.

hug;-;Dear Counter-Strike Players, After a long period playing this game (~1000h) I think I have the advantage to write a better review than my last! First I want to say thank you Valve for making a nice game like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive! BUT: There are some things Valve has to change really fast! 1. Cheating: There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it! 2. DDOS-ing: I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure! 3. Smurfing: Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this! 4. Patches: Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem! 5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver): Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***! 6. Community: The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly. Over all: Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better! PS: I'm from Germany, so there are maybe some spelling mistakes!

DeliciousHotSchmoes;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Review by: DeliciousHotSchmoes -Release date: August 21, 2012 -Genre: First-person shooter -Developers: Valve Corporation, Hidden Path Entertainment -Platforms: PC, PS3, Xbox 360, OS X, Linux The Review Both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire Steam library, CS:GO has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly, as I've enjoyed over hundreds of hours, playing this joyous game. From the teamwork, player rankings, campaigns, competitive gameplay, music, replay value and much more, this game is a king amongst most modern, multi-player FPS' games and still going strong even over just a measly three years. Just like its predecessors, the player assumes the role of either a counter-terrorist or a terrorist, both with their own unique missions, depending on the campaign in general. The newly added campaigns, Deathmatch and Arms race is a great exclusive extra if you're just a casual player, whereas there's the competitive session for the more experienced, intense and determined players out there. With every match starting, you're brought into ''Freeze time.'' where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal, just ready to be bought, either with the money you've earned by killing opponents, or indeed losing a match respectively, still giving the losing team a winning chance. While with your team, you could stick together as there are power in numbers, or go alone to face your opposing enemies. I wouldn't talk for every individual player out there, as I've seen power in experienced players. Trust me, I have witnessed a Russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents, all in the same vicinity...and yes, he was a rageful one, indeed. I also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments. Definitely pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits but doesn't go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game; the gameplay. The gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect, as you can easily navigate, along with the controls are fast and (sometimes) responsive, on the other hand, the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times, since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious, numbered team. Just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming, as it does help much more. The original music used is also a big step up, as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match, each time around. From the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time, or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion, the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is. And with an added bonus, with the Steam music player at its peak in popularity, the update with the musical kit useable in-game was a great move, as you can listen to classic music, as you slaughter your opponents joyfully. I've also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real-life history and origin in a very formal, informative and creative way. The statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out, either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun, sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second-hand pistols, when reloading your main gun that takes precious time, along with how they flesh out damage with a great, controlled accuracy. As you can tell, this game serves many different ideas, strategies, preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other. And yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple, yet fast updates. The homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest CS:GO news, such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe, or special deal offers on those elusive cases, if you're ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins. You can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back. But my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be...the community. Yes, a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional, but I'm not talking about those great people. I'm talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning-kruger affect; where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players, in a much more biased fashion. It gets annoying pretty quickly, so I would usually block the most revolting swines who do this. All in all, this game is a big, big, big recommendation from me and if you think I'm lying, just check top-selling games list at the start of the Steam page. There's a reason why this game is on the high ranking list, and that's due to its high and successful popularity.

You will get crazy people screaming at you. You will chase chickens for the whole match. You will get kicked. You will get dominated by the same person for the whole match. You will be on the losing team most rounds. You will have less kills than deaths. You will buy crazy StatTrak weapons, stickers and knives, but still only have 10 kills at the end of the match. Things that will never happen when you play CS:GO You will not get called a n00b. You will not get called a hacker. You will not get called a . You will not get called gay. You will not get sworn at. Ever. You will not ever get screamed at. You will not chase chickens the whole match. You will not get kicked. You will dominate that one n00b every match. You will be on the winning team. You will have more kills than deaths. You will dominate everyone with your awesome StatTrak weapons. 10/10 - The best FPS I have ever played.
Aro;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a brilliant game, there is no doubt about it, defintely my favorite multiplayer game that is available today! However, a game should be played purely for the sake of fun, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive can be the perfect combination of competetive and fun, but whether or not you actually manage to get any fun out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state. Simply put, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a modernised version of the Counter-Strike everybody knows and loves, only this time it has a ranking system and "balanced matchmaking" so that you always get a "fair game regardless of your skills" , sounds awesome, right? Too bad that at the moment, matchmaking seems to be broken beyond repair . I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example. 9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line. Checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had VAC bans in the past, and while that doesn't necessarily mean they are still cheating, it is not out of the bounds of possibility. Another annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that aren't hormonal teenagers or pre-pubescent children that do nothing but give out grief, racial and or homophobic slurs, then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team. But hey, if you play this game with the right people, it is still a great experience, whether you win or lose, I have met some great people in my time playing! Unfortunately these great people are outnumbered by the bad ones, at least that was my experience. I still believe that the good outweighs the bad, just ignore the idiots if you can, even though it will be hard if they resort to team-killing and intentional friendly fire, I guarantee you'll be using the "Block Communication" feature a lot . I know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isn't very good or just new to the game altogether, but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else, instead of kicking and griefing them, try helping them instead. Everybody was new to Counter-Strike at some point in time, remember that. So until Valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game, I can't really recommend it, regardless of how much I like the game itself. It's situations like this that make me wish Steam's review system had a "Mixed" option cause it really does pain me to click "No". For a game that is fun and competetive, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one to buy, but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking. If you're having a lucky day, you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go, but let's just say the odds aren't exactly in your favor. If one day the matchmaking has vastly improved, then I will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves, but until then I'm afraid I can't. By the way, to be genuinely good at Counter-Strike: Global Offensive , you must own at least one expensive weapon skin, or better yet, a $300 virtual knife. They seem to be the major factor in judging ones skills these days(!). The short version: Amazing game, but ruined by it's community.
PS7_;-;Great game that can teach you many things such as: 1. The Russian language. 2. How to be a tough guy that is afraid of nothing behind a screen. 3. How to be racist and sexist. 4. How to be spoiled as . 5. How awesome it feels to shout through your microphone and giving invalid instructions while someone is trying to pull off a clutch. 6. How to be disappointed in human beings. 7. How to socialise in a civilised and calm manner (/s). And last but not least. How to be a complete  for no reason at all. Aside from that, if you're willing to ignore the aforementioned it can be a truly great game. It has many goals for you to achieve if you wish other than the obvious goal of getting the highest ranking possible. You could always aim to get that gorgeous weapon skin you always wanted potentially without spending any money at all. It is highly recommended you find a few people to play with as solo queue is extremely toxic, harsh and often rude, as in every other game that has competitive matchmaking. Having 4 people to play with can be extremely fun since you can easily bond together and have fun either you win or lose. It's a good game and I do recommend it as long as you're willing to ignore the (Admittedly plenty of) things that are wrong with this game. Even if you don't, it can easily be worth it if your skin is thick enough or you can utilise (If you got the balls really) self-deprecation humour.

Mendozacheers;-;The "third" game in the critically acclaimed First Person Shooter series that have shaped the PC gaming industry for years. Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve. I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better. Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc. Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic "Gun Game" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic "plant the bomb"-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators. Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well. Pick this game up if you are looking for a competetive, as well as casual, multiplayer-only first-person shooter. There is plenty of room yet to learn this game, even if it seems hard at first.

Shizza;-;This game has a feature were you can turn $2.50 into 10! Then you bet that 10 skin you just got on CSGO lounge to try and make your money back, but then lose the bet. Outraged you decide to buy another key, hoping that this will make up your money by pulling a knife, only to find that you got another 10 skin. Hundreds of dollars later, finally you think you have learnt your lesson, to not buy keys and decide to buy a skin straight off the market for full price. Being still resonably new to the game, you click the unknown link, unaware of what is going on, you later realise that you have been scammed. Thats right that skin you bought, more expensive then the game, and all 10 skins you have purchased for $2.50 are gone. Outraged once again, you start this process all over, this time knowing the chances of you pulling a knife and making your money back are extremely, slim, but you feel that this will be the one, lol nope get rekt son, 69 skin.

[PUG] Jetzal;-;Uh Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed Now to make it 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

They go with it and call you a  or ing garbage and so on. No one cares about the kid who just sits there doing nothing wrong and gets called that. No one cares about the one who isnt as good as the rest, and sits in spawn while his team constantly calls him gay and a  head and constantly pointing every single thing that hes done wrong. No one bothers to give lending advice or compliment what good hes done. They just tear down the foundation of him. They dont bother mending to the walls of the household; theyd rather fire the cannons at it. They would rather choke you with aspersion than give just one compliment. The world would much rather lead the child to end of his short life, and throw away all his progress and the [wonderful] things he would accomplish later on in life. The world is sick, to me. I just wish people would cast aside the brutes club, and wield the carpenters hammer. The game itself is good, however, the community sucks.

Eventually you go past the point of no return and you simply cannot return to the surface, forced to suffocate beneath the waves being dragged down by anchors and asphyxiate from the high pitched shrieks of " Rego on this server".
Ozzyfisk;-;I want to like this game. I really do. But there's just a few quirks I can't get past. (Nothing about gameplay or anything like that). For whatever reason, I dont feel like coming home and playing CS:GO for hours as I do with other games. Also the community is really mean to new players for some odd reason. My first competetive game, I had people calling me a  just because wasn't going to the right place. When I'm the last alive and I lose a gunfight, I get kicked for nothing in particular. And when I'm playing with my friends and I don't understand how I haven't hit the person, my friends tell me, "Don't question it..." and "If you learned how to play you wouldn't get killed all the time". The problem is, how do you learn how to play when nobody is nice enough to help you out? P.S. There are occasionally the nice ones in a lobby, but they are NOT the majority. EDIT: I DID play some deathmatch, and I thought I did pretty well. Even some of my friends who are vets said that I should start playing competetive.

VIPstabcity;-;I've wasted over 200 hours of my pathetic life on this  game. Its not even fun its the exact same thing over and over again. Just like my life. Anyway, you can get new skins. Also, instead of fixing hitboxes, weapons, and servers, Valve released new summer skins, so while you get ed in the head you can inspect your weapon. Also, every single game I join I get called  for how I sound, and god forbid that you actually want to have fun. This game, will want to make you rethink your puny existince on this galaxy, and about how you are spending it shooting the same  over and over. New Stat Traks thoo####### Cant even spell Track right the ing . 10/10 Would try to kill myself again Thx Valve UPDATE I have now.... 542 hours in this game. I have wasted another 300 hours of my life, with this thing going on in my head. Now now, I know what you may be thinking. 300 hours? There surely must be some improvements with this game between then and now. HahahahahHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA I just got banned, for no being able to reconnect to a match. Not my fault, I was online, everything was going swell. DANDY. Until it kicked me out, and banned me. I final  shot in the eye. This game....has ruined my entire life. I could of done so much with my life, been something, but csgo took my lifes goals. I couldnt balance it out. This game grasps you by your balls, brings you to your knees, shoots its load in your mouth, then makes you feel like a piece of  swallowing One thing when you are playing this game to remember is that, it is never VALVES fault. It is always your fault. Everything in this game is well designed, elaborate, and rich, with team based elements. That is until you actually play the game. Then you realize everyone is as big of a ing  as you are. I hate this game, it ruined my life, it ruined my dreams, it ruined me. I never want to play this game again, I never want to see it again. I want to bury it under six feet of dirt. LOL @ ZOMBYE CHICKENS LOLOLOLOLOL HAHAH MASKS thats GR8 I can feel Like A VILLIAN DANKS VALVE. I have no reason to live anymore. 10/10 would reccomend if masochist, depressed, suicidal, or a GIANT.....ING.....LOSER Or if ur like me, and all of the aboVE.
-xilence-;-;Really good game. Very simple, yet complex at the same time. For first time players: DO NOT let the game's recoil mechanics scare you away. It will take some time to get used to but once you do, it is a great game. PROS: [+] -Great community (COMPARED TO SOME OTHER GAMES) -Frequent updates -Tradable stuff -Source Engine means that players from GMod, CS 1.6/Source, etc. won't (or at least shouldn't) have a hard time adapting to new controls and physics. -VERY Competitive at higher levels -Tons of workshop files and tons of room to make your own skins and maps -Weapon skins -Multiple modes for casual or competitive and more -High FPS on almost any PC (great optimization) CONS: [-] -Skins can be expensive or worthless -Skins and cases can suck the money out of you if you let it -Recoil is not very easy to get used to -No aiming down sights (FOR NEW PEOPLE, CALM DOWN VETS) -Cooldowns can be handed out unfairly -Low graphic quality/detail compared to other games (IT IS SOURCE, CALM DOWN) -MP only (if you are reading this, you most likely have internet at home, THERE IS A BOTS ONLY OPTION) -Hackers do like to hack in competitive matches at higher levels -Callouts are not that easy to learn for beginners OVERALL: Get it. If it is on sale, CS:GO is an even better deal. The recoil was my biggest challenge at the start but just take some time to practice with bots. Perfect for traders, casual FPS players, competitive FPS players, and workshop content creators. RATING: 9.5/10
Fargo;-;We all got here in 2012 and were like: "It's great fun but pretty rough around the edges, but I'm sure they'll fix it up and it will become a great game" They didn't fix it up. Many of the things that distinguish GO from the other games in the CS series are its worst features. The player speed, acceleration and accuracy values, plus hardly any tagging (player slowing when shot) caused the adad technique where the player strafes one way then changes direction giving him a second of accuracy where he takes some shots. What this, plus horribly broken cilent-server hitbox sync translates to ingame is spamming the strafe keys and hoping to land a shot. All this gives us a CS that values frags over brains. As I said we thought back when the game was new that all this would be polished out, it was not. Did I say horribly broken hitboxes? http://youtu.be/TQmrajx7Xrs http://youtu.be/H1lblTOV1mg http://youtu.be/cAxaaGXtmcE They haven't even had a real bug patch in over a year, you'd think you were playing a 10 year old game by the support it gets, not a 2 year old game that gets 5 million unique players a month and valve's "don't call us, we'll call you" policy only makes it feel worse. Did I mention the game is full of cheaters even up to the highest level of play? Kill me.

daV;-;Frosty was only 16 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life,". His dad hears him and and call him a silver scrublord. He knows his dad is just jealous of his devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gaben! He is so happy. Gabe whispers into Frosty's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case,". Gaben grabs Frosty with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Frosty opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Frosty's pockets. It costs so much, but Frosty does it for CS:GO. Frosty can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes begin to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Frosty wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Frosty's computer with keys. Frosty opens all the cases and gets nothing but blues. CS:GO is love, CS:GO is life.

taipaN-[CE];-;When I reviewed Counter-Strike Source a few years ago, I called it things like "immortal" and "the definitive multiplayer FPS." The Awp is easily one of the most satisfying weapons in gaming. Quickscoping and noscoping can be a gamble - I really like the balance and precise feel of the Awp. The rest of the weapons feel really good - there is much more variety here: we are talking custom weapon skins and even a custom loadout for each team. This is one of the areas where CS:GO shines, and leaves its predecessors in the dark ages. Competitive matchmaking is one of the really nice features of Global Offensive. The game allows you to play in competitive matches based on your skill level rating. This is done similar to the matchmaking in Dota 2. While not perfect, I find the matchmaking to be pretty accurate - it is rarely a cakewalk. Always be wary of the player community for this game - this community has some sick and twisted people, tons of trolls, smack talkers, hack accusers, mic spammers, and cry babies, lol. Fortunately you can mute players, and if you are so inclined, can vote them off the game - nice! Trading and items drops are a fairly big part of the game as well. One of the neat things about the game is you can easily sell back your in game drops via Steam market and basically play this game for free or even profit from it. its insane, but some items sell for over $400 USD. CS:GO is on the rise reaching peaks near 300,000 players. There are huge tournaments played, and with each passing month the game sees positive growth. I think its safe to say this is the new "definitive multiplayer FPS"! 9/10
ECTM. Codrinel;-;Another great game to waste some time :D
Hatton;-;It's ok I guess.
Defyant;-;First Off... Im not sure when Trolls, Smurfs, and Hacks began to become the norm, but the game is broken. They put it on sale for 5.00. Kids buy it just to hack it. Valve knows, they dont care. And all we do is BUY BUY BUY skins. I mean 400.00 for a knife skin? WTF?!??!!? Didnt we used to be able to get those for free? The guys hacking have a customer service number to call if they cant set it up correctly. Hacking is Big Business. They took 12 name tags from me, all because of 1 off-color gun name. Meanwhile, vulgarity far worse than my gun name, is allowed to cheat, troll, and make the game unplayable. Because its funny to watch people get . And valve does nothing but put the game on sale. And kids, Rememer. When you tell ghame developers that your ok with paying 65.00 + 35 or 50 for the "season pass". You set what the market will bear. Thus making games MORE expensive for us, and limiting how much fun you can really have with it. Cuz if you cant afford the season pass.. you dont get all that content. CSGO is setting an example of how to take all of your customers money, and make them happy they did it. Maybe they put it on sale so that you can afford to have 3 copies of they game. 1 for rank, 1 for smurfing, and 1 for hacking...
Thijs. || CSGOBetting.guru;-;Since i started to play counter strike global offensive a new world opened for me! With all the tactics i learned from this game life has become easier for me. Whenever i'll go running im sure to take a knife with me so i can run even faster then i usually do! I made a fake bomb and painted an A on the floor in the living room. Whenever i come out of the shower i wrap my towel around my head and pretend to be a terrorist. I pick up the bomb i made and run around in my house. When i reach the living room i plant it on the "A" side and make some beeping sounds. Sometimes my dog gets close to me when i plant and he starts to lick my rectal opening. I think this is just one of the side effects of playing this game. My family thinks i'm crazy and my girlfriend left me because of it. This game has become life for me and i don't know what i should do without it. Thank you Gaben, i accept you as my lord and saviour. Gaben is love, Gaben is life.

<HyperX> LakE;-;I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.
Kazuki :<;-;If i had a dollar for each time someone screamed at me in another language, i'd still have no money because i spent it on skins
rtgamer;-;It's Best first person shooter game available on Steam. Community is very much active and game is updating every month and so. Good official servers and support. Awesome. Better graphics, new guns that have been update from CSS, and the game itself is similar to CSS, which in my opinion is a great thing and it's only $15. Overall Great game.

Segal;-;Steam just offered to write a review for CS: GO. I don't own CS: GO and haven't played it, but who could say no to Gabe Almighty? So don't be like me, play your games before reviewing them.
Oblivious.Bagel;-;This is why i don't have a life. 10/10 would binge again
Ryuko Matoi;-;Honestly, whether you can aim or not is irrelevant. The TRUE definition of skill is your ability to argue with everyone. people being put into 5v5 teams is just to create the illusion of a team game. It's actually 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1. Whoever rustles the most jimmies wins. Also just like to add that the Russians are currently dominating at this sport at the moment.
HomieRicky;-;Years of playing overrated AAA shooting games with lens flares, blood on the corners of your vision, and blue everything have since taken me away from the good old primative day of filling in the shoes of generic swat teams fighting generic terrorists; of which both groups lack the ability to look down the sights of all but a few weapons. Then I found Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Being set eight years after the events of the previous game, there are noticeable changes brought upon by the passage of time. For example, the cognitive ability of hostages have further decreased to the point where they can't walk on their own. Moreover, both the terrorists and counter-terrorists adpoted new-found language ability. Finally, as we've evolved from the black and white days to being able to see the world in color, the world of Source has evolved drasticly in it's graphics in the eight-year gap between games. Among the new things introduced are atom-wide ledges, birds of superavian strength, and a modernized Russian train station which pays tribute to the skillful, fun to play with, and polite players of the Motherland. Finally, Counter Strike: Global Offensive has gone above and beyond the expectations of being an emergant AAA title by introducing an economy system that teaches rich naive kids the harshness of the post-2008 economy. Bravo. I've only played a bit of it but I will reward this game with a 9/10 for it's advanced chicken AI and the hyper-realistic sounds they make when you caress them with knifes in a fashion akin to spreading butter.
AllSwagSomeFag;-;Got banned for 7 days for killing a troll once who killed 2 people prior (needless to say he didn't get banned). i put over 50 into this game and valve just  on my face for it.  You Valve you . 10/10 Flawless banning system.
Terrorban;-;I love this game! If you decide to buy this game here's 10 Tips: 1) Your ears are your eyes. 2) Echo = Eco 3) AVP = AWP 4) Top left you have radar. Learn to use it. 5) The guns have rubber barrels so when you hold the trigger for more than 3 shots, the bullets will go all over the screen. 6) P90 was crafted by Gods so it's users are not hackers. 7) If you have the bomb, sit behind your team like a good dog. 8) The game's secret name is Counter-Strike: Dust 2. 9) Competitive is the main game mode but there are other modes for your little kids too! 10) If you easily get brain cancer just from losing one match STAY AWAY FROM COMPETITIVE! you psycho! P.S. I'm not a doctor.
TeeRave .- .-. -- -.--;-;A great game for all who think their self-esteem is too high and needs to be taken down a notch (all the way)
V;-;Let Me share My Recent MM experience . Yesterday we went 0-1 CT side Dust2. One guy called gg, called everyone noobs and went AFK until round 4, and his friend ragequit and rejoined on round 4 so he wouldn't have to bother playing the eco rounds. We ended up winning 16-5, regardless of all the GG calls and  Blyats at the start. I muted them all as soon as they just started giving each other  in a shouting match at the start of round 2. When I unmuted at 14-4 they were all best ing buddies. Giving each other calls, "nice shot guy!", "well played guys" and all that. CS:GO in a nutshell -> Win and you'll make friends for life, lose and you're just another boosted silver  blyat ing noobs gg. Just Like Life Itself ....
RoboticLemur;-;Great game but the community ruins it.
mintik;-;Too many cheaters
danmac;-;Do you want a fast-paced multiplayer FPS that is riddled with inconsistent crap netcode that readily bends over a barrel and presents a jasmine scented  which pooches open in anticipation for every two-bit "hacker" on the Internet? Well then THIS IS FOR YOU! Do you enjoy an endless torrent of  hackers? Teamkillers? Smurfs? Gobshites with broken microphones who will readily spout an everlasting supply of foreign swear words while you're trying to listen for the enemy? That's right, nothing adds to the challenge more than having to watch out for  and traitors on your own team! Laggy no-skill morons from far-flung lands who are impossible to hit? That's right, hit your router with a hammer and fill the ports with kitkat wrappers because YOUR HALF SECOND PING WILL SAVE YOU SON! That's called LAG COMPENSATION which gives ALMOST TOTAL INVINCIBILITY to anyone with an Internet connection that has no business whatsoever playing games like this. This was once a good game. These days KDR stands for "Kids, s and Russians". Toxicity from top to bottom. "But surely, at the higher levels, you get away from all that!" Yeah, check out the regular reports of "pro" players throwing matches for money, using hacks at top-tier tournament level, and acting like 12-year olds. Banwaves are good for about a day, if that, just to give you a glimpse of what the game could be. Don't even waste your time reporting griefers and hackers, if you want to do something more useful, open notepad, type some Russian swear words (you will know them all by now) then save the document and throw it into your Recycle Bin. Avoid at all cost. Play a man's game. Let the children have this one and buy ArmA 3 instead. Find a good, well adminned server. Ping greater than 300? *BOOM* See ya, Vlad. Mouthy teenager? *BOOM* See ya, Timmy. COMING SOON: Yet another half-baked cack-handed attempt at balancing the pistols ...
Orochi;-;An African guy gets $3 after working hard for 3 months and decides to open a case. He has been praying to Lord Gabe for 4 months saying "please lord gaben give me something good" he needs money to save his family. He buys a chroma2 case and a key. He tries to open it but it does not open, "wtf is wrong" he says. He starts to check and after 6 days he finds that he does not have a chroma2 case key (he has chroma one). He trades the key together with a skin (bought with his steam balance leftovers) to a chroma 2 case key. Finally he opens a case and gets a blue, " this life" he says and several seconds later he dies from Ebola, his family dies as well and so does the whole Africa. My favourite game 10/10 IGN. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Actual review ---------------------> I love this game, it needs strategy, skill and teamwork all together. But this game has 3 main problems you have to overcome. 1. Hackers in competetive matches - You join a game and the other team has a hacker. You can't do anything about it, you can report him (or her) but he won't be banned at once, and you'll lose the game (no mvps, 3 kills 2 assists and 16 deaths ........ it sucks) 2. Angry Kids - There are kids who have $2 wallmart mics and can't stop talking. Suppose you are alone and the other team has 5 members alive, you kill 4 of them and then die, the kid starts shouting and decides to kick you but you don't get kicked and then he does his job and loses the game together with you. 3. Valve - Volvo is too strict. You are playing a competetive match but something urgent comes up, you ask the players to kick you but they don't, so you have to quit. When you first quit you get 30 min cooldown. After second quit you get 2 hour cooldown. After 3rd you get 1 day (24 hour) cooldown and after 4th quit you get 7 day, YES 7 DAY COOLDOWN, who can wait that long? Now i want to talk about offensive level If you quit competetive match 4 times your offensive level is 4 your cooldown will be 7 days. Suppose your offensive level is 3 and you last a week without getting cooldown, your offensive level will become 2 (cooldows will be 2 hours long) If you can however overcome these 3 things you will love the game. I am writing this with my second steam account. On my first acc my offensive level is like 9, so i started playing CS:GO here. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- P.S. Feel free to add me, I am accepting friend requests.
farted;-;CS:GO is very realistic, the biggest similarity with real life being the fact that they both suck balls. Also, don't forget to buy our keys for only $2.49 for a chance to get a gun with a texture made in GIMP in 5 minutes that makes it look like a Hot Wheels toy.
knife;-;So I've been playing this game for long enough that it deserves an honest review. After playing a lot of TF2, I bought CS:GO and it was a relatively smooth transition for me due to my TF2 experience. CS:GO easily became my favorite game to play. I originally got ranked at silver 4, and started my climb from there. Over the course of roughly a year, I've made plenty of friends, and learned a lot about the game. I'll separate this into two groups below: The actual game: CS:GO is a game that, for me, bridges the gap between a competitive game and a game I can play all day just to have fun. With CS:GO's matchmaking, it is quite easy to get into a 5v5 competitive game with people of equal skill as you. Matchmaking is a great way to start playing competitive CS:GO, but it is not ideal if you want to improve. If you want to take CS:GO more seriously, you have to use 3rd party services such as FaceIT, CEVO, or ESEA where you will face players that have a higher skill level than in matchmaking(not really FaceIT, FaceIT is the "entry-level" service, at least in North America, so it has a lot of newer players). Unfortunately, Valve's matchmaking system is flawed and has smurfs in low ranks and hackers in high ranks, so most people that want to improve or play seriously tend to use 3rd party services. Also, CS:GO has community servers just like any other source game. These community servers run different mods and feature special community-made gamemodes such as KZ, bhop, minigames, retakes, awp only, scoutzknives, and many others. These various gamemeodes supply me with hours of casual fun with my friends when I just feel like relaxing. Trading/skins: Trading has effected CS:GO both positively and negatively. With the addition of weapon skins into the game, CS:GO grew rapidly. CS:GO trading brought a lot of TF2 traders over to CS:GO and started an ingame economy similar to TF2. Also, skin betting on csgolounge was added. Betting skins on professional matches lets you put skins on your favorite teams to cheer them on to victory. The thing is that many people take betting way too seriously(death threats to players, ddosing matches, etc etc). Csgolounge betting has had way more negative impacts on the game than positive in my opinion. I personally try to stay away from trading because it is honestly too stressful for me, and I have no patience. That's all I have to say about CS:GO right now. I would recommend CS:GO to everybody that plays any type of shooter game. A mere $15 has given me nearly 2000 hours of enjoyment, and it will continue to supply more fun for me for a long time.
ArraySeven;-;Competitive, fun, and a nice break from....shudder.....call of duty.
Eumen1Des  YanAn;-;I bought this Game with 3.75.But the skins cost me more than 375. Counter-ers: Skins Offensive.
[PlazMa]  Piggly;-;My wife said that I didnt have my priorities straight, so I challenged her to a 1v1. Ended up AWPing the  because the hoe is a silver 1 and im a master gardian. She was salty so she burned all my clothes but its k because she had a white girl booty... Anyways my wife left me, I sold my house, and am depressed.. but its ok because i bought a dragonlore, a howl, and a doppler factory new butterfly knife that i bought instead of paying for my house. Moral of the story is, this game is trash in a good way. Im running out of d0sh, I might have to turn into a  just so I can supply my addiction. Turns out prostitution isnt that bad, I mean, its very unsanitary but over all its ez $$. Just spent more than 100 dollars on cases... got almost all blues and a couple purples. Im starting to cut now because I miss my old life.... ;-; Overall.... 10/10 Would Spend My Life Savings Again
Miss mya;-;Just perfect FPS game. If you've played Counter Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike and for me killing in Global Offensive makes me feels good. This game has the best chicken al of gaming history xD

starix;-;Volvo fix it please ;d

Helene;-;My brother is an "avid amateur chess player". That's how he describes himself when making small talk. You should see his room. It's full of dumb chess pieces from different sets, like his favorite Gold Pawn. It's not really gold but he claims it is. (Nobody believes him) So anyway, one time I went to his room and I saw new addition to his collection. It was a giant paper mache bishop. Like, 3 feet tall. He obviously made it himself because it was crooked and I saw yesterday's news on the Bishop's belly. But what really attracted me to the giant bishop was its unproportionally small head. The whole thing was like a freaky baby milk bottle. So approached the artifact, and I bit the tip off. Unfortunately for me, my brother saw me do it. Unfortunately for him, I move as quick as a fox. I was a dancing blur of after image, avoiding every attack he tried to throw at me. I slipped past him and dashed straight to the safety of my dad's room. I locked myself in until the angry beast outside calmed down. Then I asked myself, "Self, what do I do now?" . So I booted my dad's PC, which I also use for gaming, logged into Steam and saw that CS:GO was on sale. I bought it. It is an ok game.

MightyHonk;-;Best competetive "guess where hitbox is", "99 in 16 hits" and crate opening simulator for true MLG players. You have beautiful classic 10x10 metres square maps to test your tactical genius, truely realistic feeling of shooting with airsoft weapons with stunning purple camo and banana stickers on them. Will i eco or will i buy after lost pistol round? It doesn't matter because at "master guardian elite" level and below your teammates will buy and die anyway and there's nothing you can do about it, since they're speaking on horrific Lovecraftian languages. Good thing skill levels make a difference and ELO works in team games, right? You just have to reach Global Elite or train your real life friends in special camps for 5 years to have competent teams and enjoyable rounds. You can play on Dust 2, Mirage or Cache, because search for other maps takes forever, which is good because these legitimate tournament maps don't reward people for "suka krisa" gameplay. Weapon spray act just like it should: it works in preprogrammed pattern so you must remember spray of every weapon if you want to kill , because if you just sit with ak and shot static target right in the head, you might actually miss! It aint 1.6 anymore, scrub! It works kinda like japaneze Touhou games: you play for 100 hours to remember every pattern and then you're good to go to play on  competetive servers where hitboxes travel in outer space and none of it actually matters. Anti-cheat system works like a charm! People can just buy csgo gift for 1 dollar at some web service, other guys can exchange it for a crate that drops every now and then, play 10 games with wh and aim and get up to "distinguished master guardian" just in 4 hours or less. Then you will be delighted to play against them as they rush middle at dust 2 making 5 headshots as fast as rmb can be pressed. But no worries! Since VAC doesn't work properly, developers added Community Overwatch where you can spent up to 10 minutes looking at some guy running at light speeds with negev spinning like a yoyo killing everything! Without even slightest reward or weapon skins you like so much you can do developers' job at cleaning off the cheaters! As for the graphics, since Source they added motion blur.

iNFAMOUS;-;EDIT- I cant completely reccomend csgo again because there are too many problems. MM is still a ing joke. Casual is just a cluster and dm is . If you wanna play csgo go get cevo faceit or go on the community servers. CSGO is still broken as  with ladder hitboxes and other  that volvo doesnt care about because they are too busy making new animations for knives and creating new operations -_- 3/10 rating still stands This is a honest review of the game Counter Strike Global Offensive or CSGO. Lets just start off by saying that previous counter strike games really have been amazing. Now CSGO is the newest installment in the series. What seems and is a fun game is plauged with problems. Lets start off by the community. The CSGO community is one of the most toxic communities out there just as bad as the Dota2 Community. They will put down new players, troll and just overall have BM while playing the game. Really valve does nothing to punish "Griefers" and others so the trolling will never really end. Another Problem is hackers. Hackers plauge the world of csgo at all ranks and skill levels. Some may be blatant and some may be more conservative. Point is that valve has really not done anything to fight hackers. VAC sucks and takes weeks to ban a hacker, while overwatch has been implemented its a time consuming process that cant always be accurate. Because of the low price of the game hackers can make endless accounts and continue to feed valve the 15 dollars for csgo so that they can continue to ruin other peoples time. Valve really has ignored the community in many ways aswell. Not implementing 128 tick servers, adding stupid stuff like Music intros to players and not doing productive things like fixing exploits or overpowered things like grenade tagging. A massive problem is also skins. They may look pretty but they ruin the game. Now I understand that valve will never take skins out of the game because it is a massive amount of revenue for them. But skins really only lead to professional players throwing matches... Nothing can really be done about this as much as the big Orgas (organizations) try to stop it from happening. Players will find a way to do it and will throw for skins when competing in small tournaments. Smurfs are considered a problem by some but I see no feaseable way to stop them so I will not be talking about that. Surrendering is also an issue. Teams playing competitive matchmaking can surrender a game but only IF one of the players decides to sacrifice himself and abandon the match getting a cooldown. When playing against a hacker in addition to getting aimbotted time after time 1 player must be punished for abandoning the match in order for the team to forfeit. This game CAN be good but valve is not doing what they need to do to fix the issues and instead adds their cash grabs to the game. The issues will persist and more and more players will leave the game. This game had great potential and is fun at first until you play enough. Then you ake notice and you wait for every patch that is supposed to fix things just to see that it is a new set of skins for some new stupid collection. Today I will be leaving CSGO maybe not forever but until they fix their issues I will not be coming back. TLDR: Great game with TONS of issues that valve gives zero s about. Rating 3/10
Kuroyuki;-;This game is so salty you could die any second...
TheElvishBlade;-;It's got a toxic community that will make you literally want to punch a hole in a foreigner's face. It's got its own economy full of scammers. It's got a betting industry addictive enough to bleed you dry of all your skins. It's got ban mechanics that make you regret not waiting a week for your last ban to cool off. It's got shooting mechanics that require immense skill and will test your patience just as much as Hotline Miami. It's CS:GO and it gives everyone that plays it anger problems. And yet we all still play it. Why? Because it's too bloody good at making us want to jump back into a competitive match and improve.
][BLVCK']['VLON][;-;Man this game is the greatest FPS around nobody does it better than this!! The creators and all around leader in multiplayer team and tactics shooter there is.... PERIOD.

Revan The Wounded Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

LemonKush;-;It has been nearly 6 months since my review so I felt it was time to update my review with my current thoughts. CS:GO is a very good game for its simplicity. The game is your standard FPS, no I'm not saying its the same as a free to play first person shooter but I'm talking about its base platform. It's a first person shooter that is strongly built around search and destroy. Though by entering the casual scene you can join servers for zombie, zombie escape and many other custom types of game modes. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not your average fps like call of duty, you will have a hard time if you think you can join the game and have accuracy when moving. (FFS P90). Once change you will need to make when switching to CS:GO is to stop when shooting. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has a skin system that if you are a gambler then I feel sorry for your wallet. Skins can be earned by playing matches and once the game ends you have a chance at skins (skins from cases will not drop at the end of games, these can only be received via market or cases) cases also drop sometimes after games. If you receive a case you can spend a few dollars to open to it, the case spins as it shows the guns and the line will eventually stop on a gun skin. That is the gun skin you will receive, if you are lucky you will get a knife that can be valued at a very high price depending on the knife. An alternative to cases and free drops is the market which can be access via steam, search Counter-Strike: Global Offensive section to via all gun skins. Gun skins are purely cosmetics and provide no advantages at all. Counter Strike: Global Offensive has three play styles. Casual, Match Making, eSports. Players looking for fun with friends without dedication to 60-90 minute games or players who like fun modes likes zombie are considered casual players. Match Making is where are "new" player should start if Counter-Strike is a new game to the player. This allows the users to get a general feel of the game, get put into a skill group after 10 games and eventually learn the maps and calls. Match making is the place to start even if you plan to get into eSports eventually. Match making is considered the 64 tick servers which you will hear people cry about a lot but don't worry about it too much. Once you get the basics down you can make your way over to FaceIt, Cevo or ESEA for competitive 124 tick servers and if your good enough jumping into the eSports scene. I don't suggest ESEA for players without experience because ESEA is where a lot of pros and very skilled players go. Once you think you are ready for eSports then form a team with friends or make your way over to cevo forums, reddit ect to form a team and start practicing. This will take time and dedication to prefect but if you have what it takes you'll get there. Lets get to the final review shall we? (My numbers are actually very high as posted, I never give 10/10 unless the game is near perfect) Gameplay: 8/10 Graphics: 7/10 Customizable: 7/10 Community: 6/10 Pros: - Can customize guns with skins. - Offers enough gameplay for any type of fps gamer. - In-Game voice chat - Has a fairly large eSports scene - 64 tick for lower end computers/internet users. - 124 tick server for eSports and some casual servers. - Large pro scene followers. Cons: - Toxic players (This isn't all the time but is often enough to say there are a bunch) - Smurfs (Users who are at a higher skill level and buy a second account to play with lower levels) only reason this is a con is because it may be the reason for your deranking in MM (If that matters to you) - Hackers (Now this isn't a game with a million hackers but the game goes on sale so often that hacker accounts are bought at cheap in mass bulks)

Mohammed;-;Dear Santa, For Christmas, I would like for CS:GO to receive an AI overhaul. You see, when I play a game, and a teammate gets grumpy, they wind up leaving. That leaves me and my friends with a bot. This bot is not very bright and will often run out into anything, whether it be a smoke, an incendiary grenade, an AWP, or a five man rush of P90's and Tec-9's. At the very least, I would love for the AI to be able to sit down in a corner as though it were a chick hatching an egg everytime it was asked to "stay here team". Sincerely Kim Jung-Un P.S. I've been very good at using my CS:GO betting money to feed the people of North Korea. It makes up 30% of our GDP.
mASER;-;The game is great for everyone calm, polite and wonderful people. In any tactical shooter I not encountered such a large number of really smart, capable lively, yet substantive discussion of people. Particularly worthy of attention should be paid to the Russians, who dominated in the field of communication in different languages. Russian friends always help me and uplift, so I'm happy with my purchase. Also pay attention to the other side of the coin (negligible, but it is tiny disgust). Of course I'm talking about Western colleagues who are often very rude and noisy. Broken, crackling microphones did not improve reception of voice messages in my headphones. Fortunately, the Russians were always cheerful and entertaining atmosphere with cheerful jokes, making a person feel that has not lost one hour at the computer to fill time counter-strike: global offensive. So if you're calm, kind and wonderful man then this game is simply for you!

It also provides a rollercoster of emotions: Anger, Happiness, Frustration, Joy, Sadness, Pride and many more good and bad emotions.

You feel the urge that you will get "an exceedingly rare special item" You spend $2.50 and open a case. Tick tick tick..... It stops on a blue gun. You feel this depression, but also this rush going to your head. You decide to spend another $2.50 believing that this special key is the one to get you "an exceedingly rare special item". Tick tick tick... time slows down as the line scrolls past multiple useless gun skins. You see it.... Time stops and you look at that beautiful Yellow Circle. Somehow, you manage to calculate the rate at which the line is travelling to determine if it will land on the yellow circle. You can also apparently have a very large IQ during this short time frame. You heart starts to beat much quicker, you know that it's going to land. You know you can finally brag to your friends that you got a knife from a case.

beo;-;That type of game which could relate to sweet old times of 90s when games were both challenging and simple enough to offer thousands of hours of gametime and still not being completely satiated. CSGO puts the CS title back on top of the competetive games and is a rightful king with undefeated throne for a long, long time. The skillcap of this game ranges from a total casual player to a hardcore pro and cannot be described be words how many factors differentiate a pro from a noob. This is the true and only FPS online game to play in 2014 onwards.

x86x;-;It's surely the best CS so far, if you can overlook the fact that competitive matchmaking ranks mean nearly nothing, as well as if you can deal with being kicked and consequentially put in matchmaking cooldown by a team of four people.

Kutar FOX;-;PROS: - Skins (you love them.) - Stickers (some are pretty.) - Competitive matches (they can make you "1337".) - Life time support and updates confirmed (operations, tournamnts, and other future contents.) - Reasonable price (minus low discount rates for those want another copy.) - Cheapest Steam trading cards on Steam Market. - Still a "classic" FPS game in terms of gameplay. - Source Engine is not power hungry and thus the game is widely accessible for lots of players regardless of their computer setups; this is one of the important factors to be a popular game. CONS: - Skins (you can't have all because: rarity, monies, life issues, et cetera.) - Stickers (some are ugly.) - Competitive matches (they can "rekt" your mind.) - It is somewhat hard to find and make a correct teabag position to desecrate fallen foes and allies due to ragdoll physics being client sided (you often see teabaggers teabagging side by dead bodies, not exactly on the bodies.) Teabaggagement must be well practiced with rich malintent and delicacy in order to execute and demonstrate a successful teabaggary to variety of audiences. - You can't kill hostages anymore unlike in previous Counter-Strike games. - You miss the Arctic Avengers and terrorists in the green jackets. - Multi-GPU setups (SLI or CF) can potentially cause stuttering issues and even some FPS drop. - AWP needed nerf? (3/31/2015 update.) - StatTrak swap tool (3/31/2015 update.) - Our money magically disappears from time to time. - Time goes too fast. - Addiction. Final Remarks: Valve. . RECOMMENDED .

_\|/_ ZeroervE >);-;WOW... Just wow... Smurfs, Jerks and hackers! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME COMPETETIVE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN !!! (Unless, fun to you is getting aggravated, being yelled at for not playing good and not knowing everything about the game.) If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competetive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!! Kill / death ratio doesn't matter anymore, you are as GOOD or as CRAP as your team is. Level up with your freinds or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as "silver hell." Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit "don't know what they are doing" againt players who purchased a secondary account and posess the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competetive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, becuse you cannot abandon a match without receiving a "cooldown time" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These higly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called "smurfs." They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smufrs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practially forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!) -----Update 1------ Yes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is. One part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5. As in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?) Face it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :D Good luck and (try to) have fun! ----Update 2----- Thanks for all the responses everyone! The rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :D I actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days. One other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor. For instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range. I keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back. When I'm asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills, give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team. I just cant help but be frustrated when I do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank. GLHF, but most importantly HAVE FUN because that's up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken!
yt.com/JaffaParty;-;Lets ignore the aggressive silvers and *cough* Russians *cough* and focus on some positive aspects: Gameplay 9/10 The gameplay itself is on par with perfection, with customization options such as crosshair (shape, size, color ect), left or right handed play and of course the beautiful console interface which makes everything just THAT more simple. Very good :) Pixel-walkers will be shot. Graphics 8/10 The graphics are very good, utilizing the source engine to it's full potential. Awesome maps, awesome scenery. Even skins that you can literally sell your soul for to make your play-style feel a little more... Classy. It better be worth it though because you're probably now homeless, because that FN Dragon Lore you just bought cost you a re-mortgage of your luxury condo. Sound and voice acting 10/10 Beautiful sound, even back in Counter-Strike: Source, Valve has used awesome audio design, with a good quality pair of headphones, you can hear every step around you, so take advantage of it! The ability to sound  is amazing when you're 1v5 clutching and you hear 3 guys to your right and 2 to your left, but can determine their distance based on sound alone, amazing. They have done it right. The original CS:S voices such as the "Terrorists Win" and "Counter-Terrorists Win" are still used in CS:GO today! Recently CSGO was updated with a new Audio Codec, making those Angry russians screaming " BLYET" just that little bit extra crisper and tasty. Good job Valve! Game physics 8/10 Coming from the HL2 Engine, the physics in CSGO are on par! To the weapon recoil, to the boost spots, to the nade stacking skills to the casual birds flying in the sky. A few issues with pixel walking especially in the professional scene (DAMN YOU FNATIC) but I think most have been sorted and patched out :) Community 6/10 Okay, so here is where i have my biggest issues. Yeah it's not the best community, but it usually depends on your rank, In Silver/Nova you're more likely to encounter toxic players who leave/troll and harrass so much that you want to literally uppercut your monitor but as you get better (and more tolerant of said individuals) and see your rank increase, you'll realize that Valve has a large hacker/cheater/smurf issue. Gaben is taking care of them in waves, but you know, how big can the waves get before you cause a Tsunami... you get me? No? Okay.. well... I'm sure they're doing something about it... sure. Overall experience: 8/10 (Amended: I found the community somewhat lacks, yet there are some awesome YouTubers that you should check out if you're interested in exploring the GOOD side of the CS:GO community. Trilluxe and Sparkles to name a couple.) It has some problems, but I'm still enjoying this game. Everyone should at least try CSGO! Updated regularly, bug fixes and such, regular tournaments, LAN events ect! New maps every other month, new skins every other WHENEVER, brilliant. Highly recommend you play this game, despite the abundance of cheaters and pro-level players getting involved with cheating, you should play this game. DON'T CHEAT THOUGH! GLHF Thanks for Reading!

Kresh;-;This is the worst game I have ever played and I hate it. Often times after a playing session I question my sanity. I have a love-hate relationship with this game. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a terrible broken game filled with hundreds of wrong things. Here are some of them: (No Russians are not ruining the game, seriously I have never ever met a bad Russian.) -Broken Hitboxes -Jumping Hitboxes -Hitboxes messed up while on a ladder -Invisible players -Hit registration -Aimpunch -Ghost footsteps -No 128 tick servers -Horrible Ice-skate-like movement -Awful matchmaking -Amount of s Valve and the developers don't give about hackers. -Bad anti-cheat -Smurfs -No 100% accuracy on first shot on the AK-47 and M4A4/A1 -Overpowered pistols like the Tec-9 and the Five-SeveN which are not fixed properly for months -Pistols' moving accuracy is insane -All guns' moving accuracy is insane -SMGs' promoting run 'n gun -P90 -CZ-75 -No wallbanging -No Bhop -Random  updates -Unexpected nerfs -Unexpected buffs -Scout does not increase movement speed - of skins -1.6/Source knives are gone -MP5 is gone -No func_vehicle -A LOT less community servers -A LOT less friendly communities around servers -A LOT less mods are being played -A LOT more toxic s -Skins -No free skins -Awful AK-47 Wood Texture - AK-47 Shooting Sound -I have a friend that I can straight on wreck at anytime, anywhere be it DM, Aim or Classic, but he is still at least 4 ranks higher than me -You need at least 1K hours to be decent at this game, and no, I'm not talking about Global Elites, there are hundreds of players times better than the highest rank in CS:GO and not all of them are pros. -This game is so bad that Valve had to implement skins in order to lure new players, otherwise the playerbase would have been a lot lot smaller now. -1.6 was better and you know it But hey, there are still some cool things, imagine you not warming up at all and hopping into a competitive game, you start CT side on Nuke and first round, the T just kick your  and that continues for a couple of rounds, still you don't give a , you did not join to win, but then you start getting mad headshots and end the half 8:7 for your side. After this your team is like: "OMG, they won so many rounds on T side, they gonna win", but you have other plans, you lead a ramp rush and even though you a silver, you make it successful through a smoke and get even more mad headshots. In the end you win the ing game. No rank up. 7/10
zhol;-;All i can say is "I wasted 7 years of my life playing a game named "Counter Strike"; but trust me friends, 'It's worth it !!!'." :)
snake;-;Lost my life
Captain Buster;-;This newest iteration of the series that single-handedly sparked global interest in competitive gaming leaves little to be desired. While its beginnings were bumpy, the developers have listened to the community and are still listening, regularly making the game more enjoyable and beginner/spectator-friendly while still maintaining the integrity of the competitiveness of the game. I have high hopes that Counter Strike will be seeing a comeback in popularity. If you enjoy competitive gameplay and bettering yourself against greater opponents, you should have no doubts when choosing to buy this game. It took me over 500 hours of gameplay to get to a skill level that I feel content with (I am currently the second-highest matchmaking rank). Thanks to Global Offensive's ranking system, even a lone player can have satisfying matches in the matchmaking system and grow in skill on their own. Yes, the occasional blips happen where you're put with unreliable teammates or put against unreal opponents, but these are only opportunities to better yourself and learn what you can do as a player to increase your odds. When you do decide to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive, I encourage you to put your all into learning about the game and bettering yourself. Research what you can do to train your aim, what you can do to train your recoil control, and watch pro players to learn about game sense. For a game in which you often times find yourself waging the same battles at the same chokepoints, it is remarkable how every battle can be just as tense as the first one you ever participated in. TL;DR: THE SKILL CAP TO THIS GAME IS RIDICULOUS, IF YOU LIKE COMPETITION YOU SHOULD PICK IT UP!

Thenewguy1;-;If CS:GO was a girl. I'd date her, and  her a lot. Then after that get frusterated because of things she does that doesn't make sense but still be with her. Then we'd have sex again. When we're in bed I'd be killin' it ontop, but when she's ontop I just absolutely hate it as she dominates me. After that we'd get into a fight about who was better that round and we'd always end the fight at a negative note. The next day I'd start talking to her again and the cycle goes on and on. CS:GO is the equivalent to an abusive relationship. 10/10 would recommend just because being ontop feels pretty good in this game.

envy!;-;I first came to cs from tf2 and a couple other single player games, being recommended it by a few of my online friends. I expected: A badly made, generic shooter filled with gimmicks to keep the player interested and a pay to win sort of system. I recieved: An absolutely amazing game with lots of depth and an insane amount of skill and strategy involved. At first I found the amount of effort, skill and stategy you have to put into player positioning and things of that nature was just astounding, and unlike any other game I had seen before. I took a massive liking to this type of game and started playing more and more. At first you will have difficulty understanding these things but putting more time and effort into the game will show results quickly. I just wanted to do a review of this game as I believe CS:GO is truly great and unlike any other game out there! Thanks for reading! ~envy

bUm805;-;I purchased this game on release day and played it for about three hours. It was absolute crap and I un-installed it. Fast forward almost one year and my friend recommended I try it again. Well, i've got to say that the game has come a long way and has vastly improved from it's release version. The game is basically 1.6 with improved graphics and mechanics. While it still needs work in many areas, the current state of the game is highly enjoyable and worth the mediocre price of $14.99. If you're a long time CS player like me (Beta 1) and don't have this game yet, add me to your friends list and we'll reminisce about the old days and maybe i'll throw a copy your way.

'M A D I - Coming Soon';-;Counter-Strike: Local offensive No longer "Global" #RipROW
DOOMSD4YY;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, is probably the most balanced Fps game in all existence. I personally started playing Counter Strike when Source had been out for 2-3 years or so. I've always enjoyed the close quarters strategic combat, and the fact that the game is all skill. The're are no unlockables, the only things you can "earn" by playing are stats, and skins. A pro player will have no statistic advantage over a gamer that's new to the series, other than his skill. +Great Engine +Great Servers +Balanced Gameplay +Smooth Gameplay +Excellently constructed maps +Stays true to the franchise +Cheap -No unlockables (except skins) -InGame purchases with real money Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the best competition style First person shooter Valve has ever made so far. Theres nothing else to the game than multiplayer (and the braindead bots). This is a must have for all PC gamers. If you dont already have the game, pick it up now, or get it on the christmas sale, in a couple of weeks. 9,5/10
PolluX;-;you can kill chicken 10/10
ownosourus;-;This modern version of one of the best competitive games of all times does a good job in introducing new players to this highly tactical and skill-based gaming experience. If you are a veteran of the old days  CS:GO might disappoint you. It sure looks nice but lacks the precision that made CS 1.6 so damn good. Its still a very good Counter-Strike, though.It may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps, and little features of past games, but Global Offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking Counter-Strike for whoever wants it. Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.Brilliant old-school shooter has convinced us that Counter-Strike franchise is in no way to be retired or forgotten.At the end, what matters is not if CS:GO is innovative or more of the same than CS: Source, what counts is if it's fun. And CS:GO couldn't be better in this regard.
J3ZA;-;Its k
Fortitudinem;-;Bought it for 11.99 Fell into Gaben's trap and ended up spending 1600+ on cases and left with . Well worth it if you ask me.
Sagers;-;I'll start off by saying that I haven't played CS:GO all that much yet, but here are some of my first impressions of the game: -The actual gameplay is flawless and it offers more than enough customization options to ensure your comfortability with the controls. There is also a huge abundance of guns, maps and unique game types to pick from. -I'm sure a lot of people are discouraged by the extremely high skill cap but I feel that the game's increased difficulty, relative to other first-person shooters, makes it much more rewarding. It is way more satisfying when you do finally get the hang of it. :) -I typically don't pay any attention to the chat/voice communication in multiplayer games such as this, but I quietly observed it from time to time for the sake of this review. I can tell you that just like in many other games, the community can be pretty toxic towards new players and just in general. Ignore the rage and you'll be fine. :P -CS:GO has a workshop with loads of community made maps that introduce unique game-modes and styles. It goes without saying that this adds hours, maybe even days, to the replayability and allows you as the player to better customize the way you play and enjoy the game. Overall, it's an awesome game and I only wish I had picked it up sooner! If you can handle the somewhat toxic community and the high skill cap, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the perfect first-person shooter and I recommend it! :)
LeD;-;PLEASE READ BEFORE VOTING THIS DOWN I cannot recommend it because this game destroys people. It's a good game but at a terrible cost. No, Im not some anti-gaming freak, I love games. But truth said, this is a great game, but it will kill you inside. Matchmaking is well made so you usually get paired with equal to average of your team. When it's easy and you wreck havoc, it's too easy, boring, unsatisfying. If it's challenging and hard, or you're loosing, you keep worrying about your stats, skill and rank. You are either bored and dissatisfied or stressed and angry. Either at yourself or the rest of your team(that other happens more often). If you live in europe, this game will only make you racist. You will hate on every person that cannot speak english or your very own language for not being able to communicate with you, or refusing to communicate with you. Maybe at first you wont experience all that by playing casual where people usually don't care, but once you try competetive, you look at casual with disgust. The better you get, the more hateful towards other players you will be. You will not remember how bad you used to be, you will hate all the noobs, skrubs and casuals. You will judge people by their skins, weapons of choice and headshot ratio. Everyone you dislike will be labeled as cheater. Where is the fun in all this, I ask? You can be proud of yourself when you win, or survive in an action where you were meant to die, but each and every accomplishment you'll get will make you crave for more, and at one point you won't feel much from winning, but you will feel a lot from loosing.
Nerd House;-;I'm probably going to get ripped by veterans due to my "low" playtime, but I felt like CS:GO deserved a proper review. Let's hop right into it, shall we? Originally designed as a Half-Life mod more than a decade ago, Counter-Strike has endured because of its well-balanced, competitive gameplay that requires skill to succeed. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a revamped version of the classic first-person shooter, offering some tweaked modes on the same maps that helped define the series. Those unfamiliar with Counter-Strike will find the game more a cerebral experience instead of the run n gun, arcade-style action popularized by recent iterations of Call of Duty. In Global Offensive, there is no regenerating health, no cinematic storyline, no experience points to level up your soldier, and no unlockable kits or perks. The deterrent for dying is having to sit out and watch as the rest of the match unfolds. While this may sound disappointing to those weaned on more contemporary shooters, Global Offensive' comparatively pared-down experience is no less thrilling. The game's focus on teamwork and tactics gives the game a distinctive feel as you choose between four online game types as part of a terrorist or counter-terrorist faction. Classic Casual and Classic Competitive are team-based modes played in multiple rounds. The goal in each is to either eliminate the opposition or be the first team to complete a map-related objective. Depending on the map and your faction, you'll either rescue or defend four hostages, or either plant or defuse bombs at two specific sites. While the goals in both Classic Casual and Classic Competitive are the same, the differences between the two are primarily in terms of scope. A Classic Competitive game consists of 30 rounds instead of 10, enables friendly fire, and has you earning money for kills, planting bombs, and so forth that's used to purchase armor and defuse kits. The casual variant gives you armor and defuse kits automatically. The other two modes consist of Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race, which has been adopted by both Call of Duty: Black Ops and Battlefield 3's Close Quarters expansion, consists of a single round where everyone begins with the same weapon. Each kill automatically changes your weapon until you receive the golden knife. The first person that lands the killing blow with the knife wins the round. This is the only mode where respawns are possible, offering a nice change of pace from the standard modes. Demolition is a mash-up of Arms Race and Classic, taking the fixed weapon progression from Arms Race and including two multi-round matches that have you trying to plant or defuse a bomb in a bank, safe house, and other locales. What makes Counter-Strike: Global Offensive appealing is that it plays differently from its competition. Tired of jumping assassins in other games? Jumping here will penalize your accuracy. Sick of seeing more praying and spraying than in a baptism ceremony? Then you'll appreciate that those who use short, controlled bursts while aiming will be more successful. If there is one knock on the game, it's that it offers the same maps as earlier versions of the series, giving veterans a huge advantage over new players. To offset this, the developers included an option to play against bots offline so you can practice each mode and map. This will give you a fighting chance against "real" players, but expect to die early and often until you hone your skills and familiarize yourself with the map layouts. Or course, the most important aspect of any multiplayer game is how much you want to play after a session ends. This is where Global Offensive excels, possessing the same addictive quality that helped make the previous games a long-term success story. Shooter fans looking to diversify their library or prove their mettle against a talented pool of players shouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger. Highly Recommended Be sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!
evz;-;It's a great game to play, if you love being insulted by raging nerds who blame their teamates every time they get killed.
Scrappydew;-;It's like trying cocaine for your first time.... You can never get enough of it
Ambient Awaking;-;I have no mercy for the chickenz.
SwaM;-;Hey. I am going to make a review of the game Counter Strike Global Offensive My experice - I have played cs for 2k hours + watched/followed the scene for a long time and now some history as well. I hope you learn something and maybe even buy csgo after you've read my review. :) Counter Strike is an fps game, where the only thing that matters is skill (aim + gamesense + communication). It's the opposite of a "Pay to win" Game. It is true that u can spend how ever much money you want on Skins, but that will not make you as a player better in game. MM - The matchmaking in csgo is good. You will get matched up with close to equaly skilled player. It is 64 Tick servers something that alot of people complain about, but most other FPS Shooters have 16 or 32 Tick Servers (ex. COD). The biggest problem with MM IMO is Cheaters. As you rank up you will face more and more cheaters. Valve is working on (VAC), as it has been 4 ban waves (A cheat is being detected by VAC making everybody using the cheat VAC Banned) very close together. Skins - Skins don't add any value to your character (and there is no way to make your character better in any way) so it really doesn't matter if you buy them. It is going to stick out a big more which makes it easier for enemies to spot but that probably won't make that much of a difference in game. So know you think that everything is bad with skins. No. Skins help fund Major CS:GO Tournaments (250:000 dollar tournaments that are Supported by Valve). They are also very fun to play around with, trading and betting with. You can make huge profits and huge losses, but as I said. You don't have to buy them. The Pro Scene - The Pro Scene is very entertaining to watch and has IMO the best layout. There are 3 Majors Every year(Most likely going to be more as time progresses). There are also the Normal tournaments every once in a while (1-4 weeks apart usually). The pro scene is growing very fast an we will see a 1 Million Dollar leugue hosted by ESL and ESEA this year. MISC - There is more to cs than what meets the eye. All the strats, Smokes/flashes/molos etc. But there is also the surfing/bhoping (etc.) side to the game. There are servers where you can do lots of other game modes if you get bored playing the normal game (which you probably won't as it is very addicting). Final Thoughts - CS is a great game for a low price which will run on your PC, it's very addicting and fun. There is also frequent sales in the steam store. I hope you Join The CS Community, gl and hf.
unremarkable player;-;It's hard to argue that this game is probably the best CS release since 1.6. Some will disagree, might argue Source is a better game and they will have their own valid points. In my opinion this game is a true sequel. It brings the fun and nostalgia from the earlier versions of CS, the same flowing game play that made it popular and the heavy emphasis on team game play. It mates the old with the new; the expectations that a FPS be somewhat realistic if not fun to play. It's a modern game; it looks and plays like modern games should but it all looks a bit familiar, like the hot girl from years past that you bump into 10 years later. CS:GO is more technical and team oriented than previous games in the series. Shooting, movement, sound and grenades are completely different and you have to master them once again. Weapons now have a purpose - there's a reason to buy the 5-7 and P250, as well as the MP5 replacement, MP7. Team play is just as important as the economy; once you lose it there's no coming back. It's a demanding skills based that's as satisfying as any CS title has been. Pros: - Updated maps, visuals & sounds - Emphasis on team play - Valve online matchmaking as well as valve casual servers - Extensive customisability & player drops - More realistic player and game behaviour - CS:GO workshop - Pro players - Active development and regular updates - Listens to community - Low-end modern PC requirements for top quality & top resolution Cons: - Gungame isn't the same as CS:S - Because of different skills & tactics, CS:S players will feel like it's a familiar but new game. Skills are transferrable one way, not so much the other; when you play CS:S after CS:GO it will feel and sound like you're playing underwater. - Sound still seems like an afterthought - You will need to upgrade your video card to something made in the last 3 years if you want something that's playable and looks good Ratings: Graphics: 8.5/10, far improved on previous models but there's still room for improvement Sound: 8/10, feels like an after-thought, if there's one complaint I have about the game it is that the sound quality and engine just isn't good enough Gameplay: 9.5/10, excellent and extremely playable game with very high replayability Overall: 8.5/10, it's a great game and could easily be 9.5 out of 10 with improved audio and slight improvements in visual quality. It's a modern twist on an old classic. Footnote: I lost my way with CS after CS:S and I turned to a variety of other games. Battlefield 1942/2142/2/3, Tom Clancy Rainbow 6, America's Army 2/3/PG. Before then I was an avid player of CS and I would play up to 100 hours per month. When I played CS 10 years ago I always asked, why can't this game be a little more realistic? Why can't they stop people from shooting through 3 walls 20 metres apart and killing with me an awp? Why do grenades act like balloons and float through the air? I can't really emphasise how happy I am that a lot of what shouldn't happen has been removed and the overall quality of visuals, sound and game play has been improved. In the first month of playing I managed to rack up 200 hours of gameplay and I've started contributing back to the community with maps.
captainfl0;-;Russia team and voice chat  10/10
SpetsnazGRU;-;Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No  perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes. If you want to win in Counter-Strike, you have to learn the maps, play smart, and have fast reflexes. Since you work for each and every kill, it's much more satisfying than other current gen shooters. It's a real shame that the console version isn't closer to the PC version though, they could have given COD a run for their $.
bubbles;-;I used to be a good baby. I would sleep, eat, throw up, fart, sleep some more, and drink from my moms . But ever since I found Counter Strike I have turned from "that cute fat loud baby" to "that cute fat annoying  AWPer. My parents grounded me cause I threw my rubber ducky and my milk bottle in my mom and dad's face and screamed "ACE!" This game has ruined my life. 69/10 would suck.
Ragnar Lodbrok;-;Really good game,from the beginning this is a game where you play 5 on 5 in teams against each other. It begins as an fps game but the more you play it you realize that it is a strategy game. A game in which both reflexes, strategy and Teamwork.
Leipuri Hiivasieni;-;Get this game right away! You don't need other games! It will change your life forever!
FistOfPuberty;-;CS:GO is a game which was once designed around team-based attacks and defenses, something which has since been replaced by weapon reskins and recoil patterns. Pros: Very easy to hop into a casual game and enjoy a quick game. Very easy to join a competitive game and work with a team of nearly equal skill-levels in a longer game with higher tensions. New game modes to choose from. Wide variety of powerful weapons at your disposal. Betting scene. Numerous competitive leagues and teams for highly skilled players. Cons: Difficult to master weapons and recoil patterns. Luck plays a considerable role in fights. Learn a plethora of new insults from teammates. Conclusion: For 15$, it's worth every penny.
Zenkho;-;If went through all ranks (till gold nova master) and it was quite an adventure! Thanks Valve for the first cs game i would've ever played^^
Jovik;-;Now I got wise I see the devil in Gabe's eyes. Oh yes in his He fooled me with his cases He cheated and he schemed Spent money knows how he lied to me He's not the way he seemed He looks like a Gaben Walks like a Gaben Talks like a Gaben But I got wise All his random and luck - lies! Oh yes it's lies I thought that I was ingame But I was sure surprised Gaben help me, I didn't see The game for this price. Obviously I didn't take this game seriously but after some months played, I couldn't find another game to play. Curiously I crapped this game but now I know it's the game that should be paid, You will be close to this anyway. Gameplay 9.2 Graphics 8 Sound & Music 8.6 Setting 7.2 Capabilities 9.3 My not professional score is: 9.
Ripple Ghost;-;Imagine, after playing a game for almost 13 years, watching it evolve, get better, finding skills to be better than the average pub player, then the ultimate version of the game comes out, it allows for competitive ranked play at the touch of the button, you practically explode with joy, and you play, and you tweak , you find the right mouse sensitivity , you learn the guns, you learn from your mistakes , you play with friends good and bad, and then you notice during a competitive ranked game that 3 members on the other team or hacking, speed hacks, hacks that dont register direct hits, even killshots can be ignored,players using programs and hardware to intentionally lag themselves back behind corners...you feel like all that hardwork you put into the game has become worthless, you feel let down by the people who brought you the only franchise you've ever put over 2000 hours of your life into, you justifably feel cheated. And thats why i can't reccomend this game, its great, it really is, but the best part of it isn't secure from the same hacks that have been used for so long, it's heartbreaking .valve you dropped the ball, please secure your servers.
Ninja in Pyjama;-;russians are the cancer of this planet.
Loch Ness;-;"It's like call of duty with guns" - IGN
NotSteven;-;This game is the successor to the original counter-strike aka CS 1.6. Ignore counter-strike: condition zero, and counter-strike: source, both those games never blew up as competitively as CS 1.6, and CS:GO. This game takes tons of practice, and patience. Nobody can just start off doing well, you might be decent if you can aim, but there are so many factors that come into play determining your skill level compared to your opponents. All of the above is true except for when I said nobody can start off doing well, I am one of the rare exceptions where I just dominate everything. I never lose, and have yet to lose. Maybe someone can tell me how it feels to lose. This game isn't fun as much for me anymore, because I never lose.

TesseracT;-;Counter Strike Global Offensive in itself is a good game. We are getting frequent updates from the devs and the player count keeps increase. Rather than writing a lengthy summary of my opinions of the game I have decided to break it down into two groups of bullet points. **The Good** * High skill ceiling but easy to start FPS * Lots of fun to play with friends / make new friends * Many of the guns are viable unlike previous versions * Devs connect with the community and gradually make tweaks and ingame changes after deliberation. **Needs Improvment** * Visibility (HDR / Bloom are locked down unlike prior versions). * Upgraded anti cheat (too many hackers in higher elo MM). * Movement and accuracy modifications. * Some guns need further tweaking (Deagle / P90) * Valve servers need lower VAR / higher tickrate * **Overall Rating ** 8.5 / 10
bigPIN;-;Don't play CSGO if you can't tolerate cheaters, racism, hatred amongst players (even your own teammates), and under average servers. Focusing on the quality of servers, my experience has been a 5/10 satisfaction with them. Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and "var", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just "bad" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012. However, if you can ignore all of which I've told you so far, and you're fond of shooters different from Call of Duty and Battlefield, then this game is for you.

Z0mBi3;-;When Counter Strike: GO came out it wasn't very good, and the online servers was quite dead. But after a year of updates the game have become really good! I knew Valve and the team behind cs wouldn't let the cs fans down. Counter strike GO offers different gamemodes, improved graphics and overall options, a ranking system for those interested and a good variety of maps and weapons! The competitive scene have grown, and I think thats great. Unlike some other FPS, cs requires skill and training. When the game came out you couldn't customize the weapons very much, but now thats possible, with thousands of badass looking skins and stuff. CS:GO is really cheap compared to most competitors, so Im recommending it without doubt.

Konar;-;I grew up on the series. Love and hate, but it always had some magic and made me come back. When I got the opportunity to play the CS:GO closed beta it was amazing. Top notch stuff, guns had a great feel back then, no stupid stickers or skins, no failed updates. Even the final product released a year ago was good. Since the introducing of the skins, performance went to the drain (bear in mind the Source engine is 10 years old now), stability is a word of a past and the COD effect among newcomers is at an all-time high. This is not even remotely satisfying. If you find 1.6 or CSS dear, DON'T SWAP! Otherwise, you will live to regret it. You'll become a twisted shadow of your former self, incapable of gaming on that proper level ever again when you go back out of frustration. The number of cheaters and the way the support/dev team does not care about this product - makes me want to vomit. WELCOME TO COMMUNITY TESTED PAYED BETA! 7.10.14 Update: If your behinds hurt, I feel sorry for you. Focus on getting them random headshots we all get but never admit. And no, I do not mean the ones that kill us, but the ones that we frag mid air, mid run which should not even happen. But yes, you call that skill, cause it hurts the ego.
The_MadGeniuz;-;This game has become a great FPS in my library. I played a CS mod many, many years ago (Tactical Ops: Assualt on Terror) and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time. I finally bought Global Offensive and I've been impressed everything I was expecting and much more. It's a simple FPS with different modes search and destroy, hostange rescue, TDM, and more. I will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun. I typically play just competitive matches where it's a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match. It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast. I highly recomend this game if you like FPS and like playing online. Use stradegy, play with friends, play with strangers and remember DO NOT PLAY THIS WITHOUT HEADPHONES IF IN PUBLIC PLACE! "The bomb has been planted is not something you want heard outloud. Just saying. My rating 9.5/10 very awesome game!
AdobeMan;-;It's ok
ethicsw0w #20FpsLaptopClub;-;Inspiring video of the rise of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywV4oOhiFOM At first I want to point out that I've owned Counter-Strike:Global Offensive since the very first day, but I have not played the other games in the Counter-Strike franchise (just CS:S for less than a year), and therefore, I do not have much experience from CS 1.6 and CS:S. When I first played the beta, I thought it was a joke, well I knew that almost all games are bad in beta, but this was complete crap. It felt like playing some weird CS:S mod, the weapons were big and clumsy, the recoil was terrible and everything was random. Anyway, I bought the game on the release day, played a few hours, the game was still crap so I actually uninstalled it to play CS:S the upcoming six months instead. One day I got really mad at the CS:S community, because every PCW you played, there would be either cheaters or players with a higher skill level searching for players in a lower skill level to have some "fun". After some raging, I scrolled through my Steam library looking for a game to play, and there is was, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, I decided to give it a try and installed the game. At first I was quite shocked, everything was different, the GUI, the maps, the weapons - everything was ALOT better, the game did actually have some feeling now and I enjoyed the game for the first time. This was the game I would continue playing every single day for two years. During these two years, CS:GO and it's community have been through alot, there have been many bugs, cheating problems, scandals within the professional scene and dumb updates, but we who still plays the game, have made it through and will continue supporting this game and Valve, and we are looking forward to the day when CS:GO will be the number one game in the world. And at last, a tip to whoever reading this, don't judge Valve's moves before you analyze the outcome. As an example, when Valve released the Arms Deal update (the update including skins, cases and keys), I still remember the reactions, some were good and positive, but some were angry and attacking. Many people stopped playing CS:GO entirely due to their thoughts that CS:GO had become a "child game" with skins and such. Well look where skins brought the game, we do now have atleast 3 major tournaments a year (more to come), ALOT of new players and a developement team who puts even more effort, in making the game as good as possible, than ever before. Thanks for reading this review, and I'm sorry if you think it was too long, and that I didn't bring up any pros and cons about the game.
volka;-;Basic Gameplay You play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice. You can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you. On the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?. Anyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode. As a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction. Being a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb. I'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here. Positive attributes : - Matchmaking - Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later) - Ranks - Cool looking skins - Fast growing population of players - Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often - Chickens - High replay value - Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring) Negative attributes : Although I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work. I REALLY wish it were longer.. And that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his "7 year old could beat you, blindfolded." - The game mode "Infernal" played on the map "de_inferno" Some people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you. It seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time. - Demolition, Also known as "jokemode" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that "4_chan" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since) Demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing! The volka Strategy You could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR you could play the game correctly like me. Here is my strategy : - Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money. - Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get. - Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can. - Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops]. - Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops. - Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job. In a whole, I do love this game And would recommend to anyone, Good half, Good half.

Revan The Wounded Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love...

Good luck! (   )
=Chdc= Chris [];-;Started playing cs go because I could earn money by cases and mission drops to buy other games, but then I got hooked. Once you play a while and know how the recoil, tactics and maps work, you will have a lot of fun playing competitive and other modes. Whats better then play a game you love and get free money to buy other games.
RVK;-;CS:GO is arguably the best Counter-Strike in the series. Counter-Strike's unique style in the first person shooter genre has made this series a trail blazer among many other shooters. CS:GO carries this mantra and revitalizes the concept with content that is mainly user driven. Compared to the previous iteration, some weapons have been replaced with similar counterparts while the maps have been upgraded and balanced more appropriately. Admittedly, the game was riddled with issues during the early stages but it has matured drastically since its inception, owing to Valve's diligence and community feedback. CS:GO's 250,000 concurrent players and the ever expanding competitive scene stands testimony to this game's successful approach. At the heart of this game is the community's boundless imagination full of custom maps, skins, stickers, and soundtracks that add style to the gameplay. Additionally, to show appreciation to the community, Valve packages community content into DLC and uses it to support the content creators and fund the competitive scene. This game is a must have for the FPS fans.
uhhh blazblad;-;this game is ing dank as  m8 if you get it ill give you a dongar bill
Aireen;-;It has been a year i'm playing this game. A lot of fun playing this game with my friends, also getting a new friends because of this game. But it was a years ago, untill the new update making the MM become sucks. I dont know why, but its like the V.A.C Security is so weak now adays, i meet a lot of cheaters, wallers, aimbot out there without getting banned. Seen so much overwatch replay that contain a lot of reported hacker waiting to be punished but none of them get punished soon. I do want to recommend this game, but today, i think there's no need to buy this game anymore, its like you just spend your $15 for meeting a cheater in MM.
Blairhexor;-;Really fantastic and balanced game! And think about the competetive aspects you could compete: - Queing up vs fullpremade teams as solo! -Getting kicked out of a ladder game just for fun for having a disconnect, even if you have 10:0 stats. -If you arent familiar with russian greetings you should inform yourself before joining a game, else you would be confused about  BLIAT VODKA VODKA, YOUR MOTHER IS A *BIEEEEP*! - Matchmaking is starting 4vs5 games, enjoy your bot! - People get random Matchmaking bans, because they can`t reconnect due to bugs! -You have to decide what player you are, you have 2 options. You can be the noob or the hacker. As Noob you basically have worse than 1,0 kd. As Hacker you are above 1,0kd, pretty simple, isnt it. -Oh and if you meet people who are Master Guardian after 20 hours playtime, dont be afraid. Its okay. The boy/girl is just playing on one of his 37 smurf accounts. I can really recommend this game if you live in russia and your IQ is below 70! Or you love the sound of ongoing 13 yo german gangster-rapper screaming in your ears, this game could be for you. If you arent sure yet if you should buy this, just check out some hacks in youtube which are available for cs:go. Its awesome. You see flying people who shoot with homing bullets through 10 walls while screaming in voicechat, YOU ARE ALL NOOBS, BUHAHAHAHAHAH. And honestly, who would want to miss something like that :) ? If the current bugs are taken serious by valve the game might leave beta stage in like 3-4 years. Buy it right now!
ThatBlokeWithTheHat;-;Do I like this game? Yes. Can I reccomend it? No. It's too hard to get into. Most new players will not gravitate towards the Competitive scene, despite it's the place where people should start, strangely. It's just not a good game to start.
ExplosionPants;-;I've spent way too much money on this game.
Vim Text Editor;-;Engine still broken after idk how long. Stopped playing when the buggy as hell CSS was released try to get back into it but the registry and .netcode in this version of the game is still so awful that it's nearly unplayable. The community consists of "die-hard try-hards" and people who haven't the slightest clue as to what they are doing. Ranks are useless and baseless as it falls under a W/L ratio, rather than a K/D ratio like its forefather CAL. With this release Valve continues to make money off of other people's ideas with stupid things like gun skins and lacks the originality it once had with it's release of HL1 and 2. All in all this game is a huge waste of money and does not give anything to the modding community that once made this game thrive. Forgetting the average age of a gamer and turning it's back on the people that made CS a once world renouned title.

JZFB;-;My religion is Counter-Strike, has been for 11 years.
[Lemons] loopuleasa;-;Simply the cake of first-person shooters. In my head CS is the purest aim-based shooter. The Counter-Strike series are an absolute classic dating back 12 years and the recipe hasn't changed very much. Why change what is not broken, and Valve realized that and made CS: Global Offensive a modernized and community-driven version of older holy grails like CS 1.6 and CS:Source. I just had to buy this game for the sake of the good old LAN-party days and the lasting effect CS 1.6 left on me. ------------------------------------------------------------------- I am very pleased with what Valve managed to do with this game. I never knew it was possible but they managed to make the game compatible with all skill levels, as opposed to something like let's say CS 1.6 in which "Get rekt" is the only game mode new players can play. What surprised me even more is the fact that they kept the classic feeling of older titles in this series. All you have to do is go into the game options and change your crosshair to "Classic" and you're set. As I expected from Valve's legendarily well-made engines, the game is running as smooth as butter on ice. The input scheme is astonishingly sharp and for good reason, since every single pixel can make the difference here. Speaking about pixels, the graphics are based on the Half-Life 2 engine and I must say, they're extremely fitting and the very, very well-made maps are the cherry on top. Nothing distracting here and definitely nothing ugly or out of place. It's a minimalist approach in my opinion and I absolutely love it! No extra filler added in, only what's needed. As a result the game is optimized as hell for high frames per second. Flawless gem polish all-around, can't really spot any imperfections. CS:GO is really balanced around the player's skill level, the player's aim and his team synergy. Match making is solid, too. There is really to complain about in this game. If you are losing it's because you suck and if you win it's because you are a mean, well-oiled clicking machine. I haven't really delved too deep into the team aspect of this game but I am really looking forward to the new "Competitive" matches. I will get there eventually, I just need to get even better than I am now, and maybe make some time to play more awesome games like this. Competition is not absent from this game, it's over-abundant for those who want to seek a challenge. You'll get it, for sure. The game modes are plenty as the maps. They include the classic Terrorists -- Counter-Terrorists paradigm and they revolve around the classic: Plant the bomb, Rescue the Hostages and many more new ones that are just a truck full of fun. More casual and more well-known game modes like Deathmatch and such are in the game if you want to shoot something fast. I am really surprised by the numerous and awesome community this game constructed, and it's constantly growing too. The players are really friendly and fun to play against from what I've seen. Good sportsmanship too. All in all, what it really comes down to is the fun aspect of this game, and boy, I must say after just a couple of matches I realized I was gonna skip the night just to play some good old CS. The game is fun and addictive once you get into it. Rounds may be short, but the replayability is ridiculously good, and it scales well with the multiplayer aspect. Man those headshots are satisfying to land. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Some tips I gave to a friend, and I'm sure these will be useful for newer players out there: "In CS, basically you have to click on the enemies head before they do, while your crosshair is minimized. Don't shoot unless you have a guaranteed headshot. For starters, I recommend switchingto one of the dynamic crosshairs in the option menu.I use classic dynamic. Now you have an idea where bullets are going. Try shooting bullets at a wall and see where they hit. Try full auto, try burst. Try practice mode here, without bots. In 98% of the situations it's good to burst or semi shoot. Never go full auto, controlling recoil is essential. You must wait a bit until your crosshair is small before shooting. Don''t forget to use Crouch/Walk (Ctrl/Shift) to minimize your crosshair. For beginners, try crouching when you see a guy and try clicking on his head. Also, never shoot while moving, your rekoil is huge and you don't have chances to hit. Don't forget to put your crosshair at head level always. Keep it up and close to corners. When enemy comes by you only have to move an inch for a headshot. Play deathmatch at first to train. What matters, in order: 1) Aim All weapons are hitscan. Aim well and use low sensitivity + a huge mouse pad. I go 28 cms per 360 degrees. 2) Reflexes You have to aim accurately and you also have to be fast in doing so. No point being able to click on the enemies head if he clicks on yours first. 3) Map awareness and predictive thinking This is basically your game skill that you've gathered through experience. Knowing how to be effective on the map. Knowing where enemies are. Listening for enemies. Knowing to take cover. Knowing when to engage. Knowing to stay with teammates. Knowing where to throw grenades." ------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall, this game is absolutely great. Can't really point anything wrong with it and I'm really looking forward to spend hundreds of hours on this one in the long run. Maybe I'll uncover some things wrong with it after I play it more, and I'll surely update this guide. Buy it. Especially if: -it's on sale -you like FPS's, especially if you've played and loved the classic ones like CS 1.6, Quake and such -you have good aim -you like a challenge and you have a competitive nature ------------------------------------------------------------------- ~~~ 9/10 ~~~ A sacred beast of a game. ------------------------------------------------------------------- "Counter-Strike is a pretty simple game. All you have to do is click on their heads" ~ Anonymous
The Global Copper Elite V;-;Indian CS:GO in a nutshell: 1.) Purchase CS:GO 2.) Beg for skins to every player on server in casual or MM 3.) Use public and private hacks to boost fellow indians 4.) Get VAC-banned like a boss and buy another CS:GO on other account. Jump to casual and use same hack showing small  is to all the people 5.) Play like , buying smoke and other nades but never using it on time. 6.) Votekick the person who is angry on his team and telling them to focus on minimap. 7.) Votekick the person who is noob. 8.) Votekick the team-person who is good player and owning enemy team without hack. 9.) Game sense like rice, no sound sense, network spikes to 500 ping but still awping, getting 10 fps on all maps. 10.) Scam other fellow Indian players because they can't afford the knives from their papa's pocket money. 10/10 game ing best ever.

ThioJoe;-;Counter Source: Global Office is a great video game to play on the internet. Personally, I like to play multiplayer more than single player. However, multiplayer is more difficult because the enemies shoot back. I think they should nerf the sniper because people can kill me in one shot even when i buy the helmet! This game is very tough but fun. I heard that the pros warm up before their matches by playing minecraft so that's what I do too.
tacularr /z/;-;Get called a hacker simulator 2012.
Devon;-;I really want to recommend this game. It's a more immersive shooter than any of the Call of Duty series, and the way the game is made requires logical thinking and tactical strategies to win rounds with your teammates. When the game goes well, it's buckets of fun. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to newcomers. There are many reasons for this. First of all, unless you plan to mill around in deathmatch or the other lesser-played game modes (so anything but casual/competitive), you're going to die, a lot. And then you wait. You watch your uncooperative anonymous Russian teammates slowly break apart and lose the rounds in the most ludicrious fashion. If you can stand the game long enough to become half decent at it, you may find that you can often shoot someone in the head, literally tracing the bullet into their cranium, only to see that it doesn't register the hit due to the sub-standard 64 tickrate matchmaking servers and/or your West Country internet connection, thus falling victim to yet another unfair situation. If your internet connection is not the problem, you may try using ESEA or Faceit to play your competitive matches with. So you can pay more to play the game for no benefit other than to escape the crap quality of the standard servers, or faff about on Faceit, waiting for the afk team captains to pick maps, or the other team to cower away during the initial deciding knife round. After a few bad experiences, I've decided that Faceit isn't worth the hassle. Playing competitive also puts you in danger of not only numerous wallhackers, but mainly these things called smurfs. Put the image of the little happy blue creature out of your head: these are the players with a high rank on their first steam account, then make second/third/fourth accounts to play against easier opponents. It's that simple, yet it's infuriating and game-destroying for us lower ranked players. And when you discover this in a competitive game, your only choices are to stay there and endure it, gradually losing your sanity, or take a competitive ban. If you're lucky enough to have decent friends, they may just kick you from the game, sparing you of either choice. Having played almost 3 solid week's worth of the game in total, I have accumulated a wide friend group who also shares my pain, but we still play together for the social side. This is when I can recommend the game: when you've already played a lot of CS:GO and have many friends that also play the game. If you're new, and have less patience than a special forces marksman, you're going to hate this game. I hope that if you decide to play this game, you can take my advice with a pinch of salt, as I am admittedly easily riled up in the heat of the moment. However, if you too go ape, you only have yourself to blame. Also, look out for skin collecting. I've been caught by it, it saps a lot of your money, and is literally an addiction. Not a good one like being immersed in a fandom or crack cocaine: one that's ultimately utterly pointless.
Say goodnight to the bad guy;-;Takes time to get used to, but despite all the cheaters, probably the best of whole Counter-Strike franchise. UPDATE (2015/04/24): Got banned from my favorite game because the Beta Overwatch couldn't handle me. 0/10 Would not spend 5 years of adopting a unique play-style again.

Svirt;-;It's modern version of cs 1.6 and I think its more realistic with new design of skins, walls and everything. Its really good game to play with friends. Ranking and competitive game systems are most valuable things in Global offensive. There are achievements for achieve-hunters, arms race (typical gun-game) or demolition mode - so game has everything I wanted. CS:GO settings is changing all the time, but it will only anger you, so dont care about it just play! :D Still the best multiplayer FPS. 8.5 /10 Must love that gun. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCCimysCu1g

Smurf;-;Over 600 hours on CS:GO. Over 13 years playing CS in general. In older versions of CS if you are high skilled you can easily take down 5 low skilled players. In this version you are lucky to get onto the 3rd guy. Game is all about luck, not skill based like all previous versions of the game. Ranked up to DMG with over 200 wins in competetive and i can say this game should be released as a 5 person COOP. You should only play comp when you have 4 other friends who you know won't troll you, regardless of their skill level its better to have that than random teammates. The hit reg in this game is absolutely nothing compared to previous versions, due to the low bandwidth allocated to the gaming servers setup by valve. The skin system is nothing but a huge money grabbing scheme which no doubt has earnt a huge amount more than the game sales alone. As with all games you can trade in, this one is full of scammers. Constantly, daily trying to scam your high value items from you. Procede with extreme caution when making trades with anyone you don't know. This game promotes gambling to under 18s with the skin drop system, costing each skin a certain price with a possible return on investment. Gambling sites are regulated and usually offer around 85% return on your gambling in the long run. I believe there is no regulation of this system and there's plenty of 12yr old kids out there throwing away hundreds into this system. Alot of reviews have complained about cheaters. This isn't such a bad problem nowa days as the overwatch system has taken over VAC in the competetive section of the game, blatent cheaters are caught and banned for 1 year quite quickly and the players that support and judge in this system are to thank. Overall the game it's self has a great system but just isn't being used to its full potential. Allocate more time and money please valve.

TR:oY Panther;-;I must recommend this game, it is my duty as one who has spent 1600 hours on CSS (from xFire) and 500+ hours on CSGO. I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here's what I have to say about GO... CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc. It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of. Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me. Game play wise, each CS as I know them (1.6, Source, GO) has been different beasts in terms of mechanics and recoil control. Lots of little things that made or broke you as a player in these games, but recoil control is one of the biggest. You often hear people scream deathmatch deathmatch deathmatch, that's the only way to get better. Well, quick point, how can you DM to practice when you don't know what your practicing? Best thing to do to understand the recoil patterns is load an offline game, kick the bots, and shoot at walls. Seriously. Shoot and spray at walls with various guns at various ranges with various movement patterns, that's the best way to understand how to control and use various guns. You need to understand each guns grouping patterns first before you can practice controlling them! About the community, yes, the flamers and trolls are alive and well. But here's the thing, I've been around CS a long time, I've won 4 regional championships with CS:Source, and really it never bothered me that sometimes the flamers are all you hear. Here's why. Once you play enough games (competitive or otherwise) you'll hear the same kind of person, it'll sound like this.. you guys suck, why are you even playing this game? or something similar if they are beating you. It sounds like this, you're such a hacker, it's so obvious when you beat them. The fact that people are so binary in their mentality amuses me personally, so I carry that over to CS flamers as well. Some people like to pretend they are perfect at the game, and everyone else around them is inferior, yet if you beat them you must be a hacker. It just sounds so stupid to even talk about it but seriously this is how a lot of people are about the game. Just don't let it get to you, there's no point. Don't even engage. And you wont have many problems. It's not the easiest game to pick up right off the bat. Spray at feet, get headshot is a notorious saying from outsiders about CS games, because CS can be amazingly random sometimes. And the round-by-round economy, buying guns and items every round, and recoil patterns make it a steep learning curve. But if you understand the groupings (I said how to above), read guides about strategy (like economy management, game flow), and just get in there and start playing you will see why people just can't stop playing this game! Counter-Strike was the world's original eSport. After the Championship Gaming Series went down the CS1.6 and CS:Source attention did as well, games like StarCraft and DOTA took to the forefront of competitive eSports soon after. But with the cases, skins, and major tournaments Valve and the CS community have turned CS:GO back into one of the world's premiere eSports and there's many, many reasons why it's succeeding. As I say, it's a very exciting game to be a part of right now.

Bidule;-;Best multiplayer FPS ever made but we miss de_prodigy :(
SWAG.Brownie;-;I've held this view of CSGO for quite some time, but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts. I've been playing CS for many, many years - starting in the early 2000's through to present day. This time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages, enjoying leveling my character in WC3 mods, smashing heads in deathmatch, surfing backwards, long-jumping, bhopping, played in quals for WCG, competed in CEVO and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments. I've enjoyed CS from 1.1 to 1.6, CZ, CSS and also CSGO. No, this does not make me a better player than you, and no this does not mean I know everything, it simply means that I have spent a lot of time playing different titles of Counter-Strike, have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases. There are a handful of things that really upset me with CSGO, and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after I have first played the game. These issues I consider to be game-breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play. I enjoy CS because there is a skill curve: if you want to be the best at the game, you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent - This was certainly true in all other CS games I have played, but not CSGO. CSGO feels like it is a game of luck and chance. As the game stands, it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or MM is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game. Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when jumping Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when crouching Hitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bomb Aimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag-compensated If you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick Server, this is how most events will play out: You see an enemy jump, you shoot the enemy and get no hits. You see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot, you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle. You shoot thin air, blood appears and you get a headshot kill You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his chest, you get no hit and then he crouches instantly. You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot (because he was crouching on the server) You see an enemy, shoot first, die and get no hits. Watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof. You are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb. You crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times, slowly one by one. You get no hits and die. All of these aspects of the game I consider EXTREMELY game-breaking. The fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves, "Yeah, that has happened to me on a number of occasions" just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed. In it's current state, the game rewards people for NOT AIMING - aka, "good" players in the game need only aim at the ground, run and shoot and they'll likely get a headshot, because as long as you don't aim AT the model that you see, there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit. The only one of these bugs that existed in Counter-Strike Source (pre-2010 OB update) was the hitboxes on the planting animation. An example of a bug that I do not consider game-breaking, but extremely frustrating, is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player. For some reason, after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this? A feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken, and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch? That is a huge disappointment. People standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them, but the player's screen will be completely black. This was an unintentional meta-change when trying to fix one-way smokes, and this new issue has existed for months now? The game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them. Throw a smoke down, wait until it starts to fade, teammate resmokes - rinse, repeat and run down the timer. Retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can't capitalise on the blind-criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible. What a horrible meta change. Why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago? 3D sound is non-existent in CSGO. It is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you, and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind. This game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny. I find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues, and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems. I see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other, but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable. It'd be nice if people were able to draw the dev's attention to these issues and press for a resolution.

MaxOfS2D (see you at TI5);-;I could never really get into Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source. But Global Offensive is really easy to pick up, is pretty polished, has nice customization option, lots of neat little things all around. It's a good MP title. I'd recommend trying to play with a friend who already knows about the game's mechanics and the metagame, too. It's a very gradual learning experience.
Soft;-;This game is really cool, especially with the Matchmaking system. We can play with the pro conditions with our friends, and it was really appreciated. If you didn't like competitive, cs:go contains a good community and have a bunch of servers with mods (like zombie, minigames...) If you didn't already have this game, i have just one thing to say: just give it a shot. You will certainly spend a lot of time on it!

GSDrodos;-;The way you get the rank is so stupid because without pre-made team you are nothing. So the rank doesnt show your real level. Also what about bans?If there is blackout in my home how can I avoid the ban?You have only 5 or 7 minutes to join again. And if the electricity doesnt show up then you have to be banned. Also full of hackers. 6/10
Tay;-;INTRO: So i gave a thought for long time about what i'm going to write down on this review since it's one of my favourite games on steam. GAMEPLAY RATING: So far i can tell that the gameplay really makes fun especially the gungame , deathmatch mode and the normal casual stuff. Developers definetly achieved to create a varied and half way balanced game elements in this fps game. they still do some updates and make some changes by and then just to appear it more interesting.  From the point of technical aspects they succed so far ( at least in my opinion ) , because all different weapons can be used for certain situation so there aren't many weapons which are superior to others, in addition you can balance this by teamwork and strategic actions. Yes this game is not only about skill, it's more relying on teamwork , which is also an interesting fact about this game, because high skill doesn't mean anything to this game. COMPETETIVE OR NOT? : For me there are only two sides of this game : Competetive and non competetive For the non competetive part i can give a recommendation , because it bonds a lot of fun and variation for players.  In contrast for the competetive part , unfortunatly i can't give a recommendation . You sure ask why. The reason is the community itself, it's poisoned with pathetic low self-esteem people who create smurf accounts in order to hack and ruin the game, and as if it's not enough they also insult for no reason . they probably do it to strenghten their self-esteem or maybe they need mental help i don't know , somehow or other it's really bad. Almost every match i only read on the chat " look on my main account im *insert here high rank*" . so if this is the case why are they even owning a second account then? and making hacks appear so obvious?! i really don't know. And before people come to me and to label me as a low player, my highest rank so far was Legendary Eagle, but i don't care about such stuff, it just ruins my mood to encounter obvious frauds who also try to insult you via mic or chat just because they don't have got any balls in real life. that's why it is so pathetic. In addition some random players in your team also do some mistakes on purpose to ruin your day more. i mean i play this game to get rid of my stress and all i get in return is only more stress. i wouldn't even care if i would lose all the time, when i could be sure that they aren't hacking or insulting each other like 10 years old kids. It's also a sad fact that people think big of them by hacking and can't even speak a single word in english, like if they are some uneducated people or anything.  i will still play this game, probably because i still have faith in humanity, but so far i only got disappointed. TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT: Recommendation for non competetive games : YES Recommendation for competetive matches: NO The decision is still up to you.
v;-;awesome game ... You need it if you dont have it..
Zer0 #SWAGFATHER;-;good game if u want to get mad and occasionaly have a good time
shoop;-;the best and the worst game
JouleThief;-;Counter-Strike is a good game that is past its time. The recent addition of weapon skins as prize drops does not improve it as much as it cheapens the overall experience. As much fun as I've had playing Counter-Strike over the years, I now feel that new games such as Insurgency improve upon the formula and offer a similar but richer experience.
Jack of all Trades;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games that is kind of hard not to recommend. It's a solid shooter and it is cheap and looks really good for a game that runs on the Source engine. To new players CSGO may feel a little "back to the basics" as this game does not have aiming down the sight, unlocks, attachments, perks and killstreaks so it's heavily based on player skill and not on selecting the perfect loadout with the perfect perks. This game does have a ranking system but it's different from all the other shooters which I'll explain later on. But the game does show a lot of depth as you play more and you will find out that not everything is as straight forward as it might have looked. It's also a tactical teamplay based shooter, so don't even think about buying it if you don't like teamplay. Only a good team can lead you to victory, not a highly skilled lone wolf. CSGO offers a small variety of game modes, those are: Deathmatch, Arms race, Demolition, Classic casual and Classic competitive. For those of you who are familiar with COD Arms race is called Gun game in COD. You start off with a weapon and every time you kill someone you'll advance to the next weapon until you get a golden knife, kill someone with the golden knife and you win the game. What's rather interesting about Arms race is that you still play in teams 5v5 but the one who killed enemies with all weapons wins. Demolition is a combination between Classic (Ill explain classic later in the review) and arms race. The goal is to plant the bomb as a terrorist or defend the bombsites as a counter terrorist or defuse the bomb if its planted, there are no respawns and instead of buying a weapon you start with one and advance to the next weapon if you made any kills during the last round and if you made more than one kill you'll get extra rewards like frag grenades and flash bangs. In my opinion those game modes are fun but unnecessary because I never really feel the need to play them. There's also deathmatch which is a little different from the usual (team)deathmatch. It's played 5V5 and all weapons are available except for grenades. you play in a team but it's every man for himself as the person with the most points at the end of a round wins. What's also interesting about Deathmatch is that different weapons give a different amount of points and at some point during deathmatch certain weapons give bonus points. In my opinion deathmatch shouldn't be taken to serious, It's a good gamemode to improve your aim, and I know most new players will jump right into deathmatch but that's in my opinion not the way Counter Strike is supposed to be played. So that leaves Classic casual and Classic competitive which are almost the same gamemodes, therefore Ill use this section to talk about the things these gamemodes have in common and in the next section the differences between these gamemodes. Classic consists of the two original Counter Strike game modes: defuse mission and hostage mission. In hostage mission the counter terrorists have to kill all the terrorists or rescue one of the hostages (in the other counter strike games all the hostages have to be rescued) and the terrorists have to prevent the counter terrorists from rescuing the hostages by killing all of the counter terrorists. In defuse mission the terrorists have to plan a bomb at one of the two bombsites and make it explode or kill all the counter terrorists and the counter terrorists have to win by killing all the terrorists or by defusing the bomb if it's planted in which case killing all the terrorists does not result in victory. Both defusal mission and hostage mission have a money system. You'll receive money for all sorts of things, playing a round, of course the winning team receives more in most cases, completing a part of the objective like taking a hostage or planting the bomb and kills. The kill reward depends on the weapon, a rifle or pistol will give you 1 kill reward while an SMG (except for P90) gives you 2 kill reward, a shotgun gives 3 kill reward and a knife gives 5 kill reward while the AWP gives only 0,5 kill reward. At the start of a new round you can buy weapons and grenades with the money you earned and the money you don't spend will carry over to the next round. So now the differences between casual and competitive. In casual you play either terrorist or counter terrorist and the best team out of 15 rounds wins, in competitive the teams are swapt after the 15th round and the best team out of 30 rounds wins. In casual you'll receive more money if you lose a round, less if you win a round and the kill reward for a rifle is 150 bucks while a kill with a rifle in competitive rewards 300, the developer did it this way to balance the difference in money between the good and bad team and the good and bad players in casual. Competitive is played 5V5 and casual can be played 10V10. In competitive you have to buy your armor and your defuse kit while you get those for free in casual. In casual you can just drop in a round and leave whenever you desire while in competitive you join at the start of a game and you're not supposed to leave until the game is finished, because if you do you'll get a penalty in the form of a temporary competitive ban ranging between half an hour and 7 days and I've seen screenshots of people getting over 200 days competitive cooldown. This is both fair and unfair as it will punish the players who ragequit, the more they ragequit the longer the cooldown, but sometimes you can lose connection to the server because of server problems or internet problems in which case you'll also receive a cooldown which is highly unfair. If you play casual you'll play with random people while competitive has a ranking system based on your skill and win/lose ratio and you'll play with people of the same skill level as you. There's also a community server browser with servers that have different game rules, use community maps or even have completely different game modes. I don't spend a lot of time on community servers so I can't tell you more than this. In my opinion competitive is the way to play CSGO, I spend by far most of my time playing competitive. Casual is great for practice but keep in mind that people play different on competitive. If you're new though I advice to play a few rounds on casual before playing competitive so you can learn how the gamemode works, how the economy system works and gain some map knowledge, why should you do this in casual? Well competitive is way more serious. There's also an option to play against bots if you're new to shooters but even expert bots are pretty easy to defeat and play really different than human players. The only negative points I can come up with is that the servers have to be improved as hit detection doesn't always works as it is supposed to work, and the ranking system has to be improved. At the time of writing I am silver elite master (fifth rank) but some silver elites (fourth rank) are way better than me and some golden nova 2 players (seventh rank) are much worse. And they could crank up the difficulty of the bots as medium bots in CS:S are way harder than expert bots in CSGO making bot practice less useful. Over the last year this has definitely become my favorite shooter, I even watch CSGO E-sport. It's a crown jewel and it only costs 14 bucks. I give CSGO a 10/10. This doesn't mean the game is perfect, of course it can be improved but it's based on the fun factor, and even though I sometimes HATE this game out of pure frustration, I'll always come back to it and there are barely any games out there that can do that. Everyone who remotely likes shooters should buy it.
Tachi;-;this game is full of cheaters and kids
Beauman!;-;CS: GO makes my  tingle with pain. When I get a headshot I wince with a burning sensation in my testicles. I realized this game is not healthy to play, one reason being I recently installed a rop hanging from my ceiling just incase i get demoted to silver elite. My mom does not approve. Everytime I get killed I cut a little slit in my arm to hopefully teach me not to die. It has not been working and I have gone into a deep depression. I do not recemmend purchasing this game that infects you with a spite to kill yourself and other, and that creates a void that only gets filled from winning matches and getting promoted. But makes an even bigger void when you get demoted and lose. Please dont buy this game if you want a happy life free of suicidal thoughts.
Futilizer;-;This game is absolutely amazing. Takes just about everything from the original Counter-Strikes and rolls them all in to one great game while keeping the nostalgia intact. This is truly a game of skill. There is no other game like it.

Banana Joystick [Away];-;No... just no. I love this game, it's really good, but I'm giving it a thumbs down. Not just is the matchmaking system broken and the community is full of russians and 10 year olds, there are countless cheater and smurfers. Oh, you wanted to play a game without constant unbalance, and wallhacking jerks? Well, you're in the wrong place. The community is toxic, wanting to kick you because you decide to save or make one single mistake. When you ask to get kicked for having to go or whatnot, nobody gives a , and you're doomed with your ban. Make ONE small mistake like accidentically flicking your mouse and boom, kicked. The smurfers are stealing kills and ruining the game, everytime I play with one I'm just planting the bomb while he gets aces and if I'm lucky I get to kill one player per second round or so. When there's a hacker on my team and I insist to kick him, my teammates give two  and won't kick him for the sake of winning. Also, VAC and overwatch ing sucks. I see hackers everyday, and VAC takes it sweet  time and lets them ruin the game for as many players as possible before they get banned, on which they create a new account to continue cheating. Don't even let me begin with knives, ing $300 for a knife? I do agree in the skins looking cool and all that but seriously, why not spend that money on upgrading your computer so you can admire your knives in better quality? And the case unboxing is ridiculous, I cannot count how many Negevs I have gotten from spending $50 on cases. On top of that, the matchmaking always puts me with 12 year olds. I'm sick of kids saying "fokk yau bish" in the worst accent possible. The workshop is also horrible, there's nothing but AWPs, AKs and M4s. Most skins doesn't even have a purple variant, and I honestly don't see why there are 6 covert AWPs and 0 covert Mac10s. Overall? +Great gameplay +Nice graphics and performace +Interesting game modes -Toxic community -Constant smurfers & hackers -Unstable matchmaking -Ridiculous anticheat system 4/10. I'm going back to TF2, at least people are mature there and hacking is pointless.
Superayman Jr.;-;The only thing this competitive game has that compares to call of duty is it's FPS aspect and a few of the guns. Otherwise, it's an upgrade to the original Counter Strike, 1.6, and source with a few additional game modes and better graphics. What I like about this game above it's predecessors is it's offline bots. The dedicated fans that have been playing CS for multiple years makes the online multiplayer very difficult (which is a good thing). So, what I like about this game is the offline bot mode, which allows people who buy this game to enjoy a little pwnage (or challenge when they crank up the difficulty to veteran) when they can't get it online. Also, everyone has an equal chance, not thrown off by prestiging or leveling up, which adds balance.Overall, it's a fun, challenging, and addicting game -- I'd recommend it to all gamers! Especially those who enjoy a good FPS.
Ov3RT4K3R;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the newest version of the well known game Counter-Strike. Global Offensive has a lot of different game modes besides of the classic bomb defusal/hostage rescue scenarios. Deathmatch, basically is about getting a lot of kills and dying as few times as possible. You will spawn at random space with your chosen weapons or random ones. In Arms Race you have to get kills with every weapon. The fastest player wins. Demolition can be a Bomb mission or hostage rescue on smaller maps compared to the regular bomb or hostage missions. Competitive is the hardest and most interesting type and is only recommended for advanced players. You have to win a minimum 16 rounds to win the game. This gamemode may take up to 90 minutes. Communication is the key here to win. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive also support ingame items, but it is a purely cosmetic thing. You will also have a chance to support the game by buying special tickets for the so-called "Operations". With an operation pass you will get access to newly released competitive maps, new weapon skins and an upgradeable medal. The graphics are much better than Counter Strike Source. The environments are more detailed and the game just looks a whole lot better. Global Offensive is one of the top 10 most played games on Steam right now, so there are plenty of players and servers. The mechanics are different from former Counter-Strike games, like the recoil for each weapon and new weapons like decoy, Molotov, etc. This could be difficulty for veteran players at the beginning. But after a while you can deal with it. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a definite buy for anyone that is into Counter-Strike. It is definitely worth the regular price of 13,99. A must have for every Steam user! Sounds 9/10 Graphics 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Atmosphere 10/10

Chupa^;-;When I first saw this game, then I thought that this game is going to suck. Oh how I was wrong. I really enjoy playing this game. I like the fact, that there are some new weapons and that you can purchase skins for all weapons. The new buy menu however is quite unfamiliar, but I guess that's a thing I must get used to. Call me old-fashioned, but in my opinion, 1.6 is still better! ==)
Gotaki #3rd 1 week ban;-;What first started as a Half life mod became one of the most played games on steam...shows how you can really go from nothing to something Pros -Recoil -Balanced maps (well most at least) -Competitive Community -You can run a game even with a crappy computer -With the VAC system, Hackers get what they deserve -Skill is required -Community mods -A special gun for everyone -Footsteps -Strategic in ways such as using flashes and smokes -Easy to play and get into Neutral -Skins, many people will say how skins don't matter and they are 'opinional' but personally who would want to play with default skins, no one would use stock skins so Valve encourages people to 'buy' keys and gamble away their skins in uncasing and bets. I honestly don't know if this is a con or not since Valve does encourage people to put more money into skins than the game itself. Cons -Hackers -Smurfs -People can be salty -Debatable if some guns are OP Overall, the game is a fun game and worth your money although if I recommend it, you will probably get involved the gambling scheme Valve proposed. As most people say to me "Skins are opinion, you don't need them to play the game", well sir, would you enjoy playing the game knowing everyone has better skins than you?
RSn|Animus;-;The best Counter-Strike after Source!
Massive;-;So, after 1000 Hours of this game, I know pretty much all I need to know for a review. This game is amazing and all, but there are a couple flaws. I am currently MG1, and it was a long road to get there. I had the troubles, of when I got on a large win streak, I would be on a game I was certain I would rank up, then of course a hacker would have to be on the other team. All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs. There is a small chance of winning when against a smurf, and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank. If you can get games with no smurfs, derankers or hackers, this game is amazing and I enjoy everything about it other than what was just mentioned. I give it a 8/10. (-2 for hackers etc)
Bread Pitt imagineak;-;SINCE ALL THE FAN BOYS ARE INSULTING ME FOR STATING THE TRUTH, PLEASE CHECK THIS GIF OF A PROFESSIONAL PLAYER BEING IN THE SAME SITUATION: http://gfycat.com/UnlinedCavernousDesertpupfish This game destroyed the series. The truth is that that I can not recommend this game with 500 hours of playing and 7 years of playing Counter-Strike series. All the necessary things have been ignored. Play matchmaking on 64 tick servers, encounter a horrible community full of toxic people and hackers. Hitboxes are terrible. New skins are regulary being implemented into the game so that everyone from Valve can "spin" the money. There are too many hackers, therefore there are many ban waves which messes up the ranking system that does not work properly for many people. I really like Counter-Strike and I have enjoyed this game for some time as well. But the bad things have taken over the fun out of this game for me. This is my view on the game.

Trotskyist;-;When I first got this game I thought it was going to be an amazing anime RPG. I turned on the game and I was so excited. For whatever weird reason, it wouldn't let me customize my character. "Whatever..." I thought and joined a server thinking maybe it would show up. When I joined the server no character customization was to be found. Nor a tutorial. Nor was Naruto, Pikachu, or Ash. I then decided I would ask the "helpful community". Unfortunately for me, I was globally offended when I asked people where Naruto was. People immediately told me to kill myself over the mic.

There is nothing better to boost your confidence than people saying "You ing suck" "Go back to CoD" "Go back to sucking your dogs , you have nothing better to do than suck at CSGO" All of which I was doing better than they were. 3. The friends and adventure you can make during MM. You can make enemies and very good friends. Some friends will just make you play better. Like me I found a girl during a match. Now we play together and we play amazing as a team. We would fight for top Fragger. Anyways you can make good and bad memories. After all its "Not Just a Game"
UBER-THE-MAN;-;Gun Skins, Cases, Stickers n' Horrible Teammates.
Cold Feet;-;Clutch or kick, AWP only Dust II every time. It is so Offensive it has Offensive right in the name
Dan [greuceanu];-;The best Counter-Strike iteration yet. A lot of updates, steam workshop, competitive mode, competitions, skins and constant content. A good way to make steam wallet money by trading or selling stuff in market. None of the games you will play will have the fluidity of a valve game and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive sets the standard. 10/10
Kawasaki Teriyaki Anarchy;-;Friend Making and Breaking Simulator 2014 11/10 would recommended
Amanda Tapping;-;a good game of the Counter Strike Series if you played CS:S you will love this game too they brought in some new modes including a regular Death Match Skins for Weapons available in store / Steam Community Market and a great new weapon selection screen for the rest the game is pretty much still the same as CS:S ,just with more Quality and added stuff Recommend this game for any FPS fan and CS:S player , if you havent played one of those before , its still a great game to try out AT - 02-02-2014 , 14:56 , GMT+1
KEN, HONG KONG 18 KILLS EXPERT;-;extremely good game since 1999
Take A Shot;-;I deliberately did not wanted to review this game after few hours of playing, cause i wanted to wait out all patches and updates to come out... What to say about this game now after 667 hrs on record...best online FPS game for me! Fair successor of CS 1.6 & Source Still has some flaws and isues regarding cheaters but it will be solved eventually... Buy this game its worth it...
420 Shades of Blaze;-;Are you willing to spend hundreds of dollars on learning Russian? Silly you! All you need is one of the steam's most popular games: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It costs only 11 euros! So now you can save a lot of money, that you can spend on digital-not-worth-IRL skins! First you'll learn swears. They are really famous, too bad they're censored on steam. Anyways, if you keep going, soon you'll be a master in russian. "You either die a russian hater or live long enough to start turning into a russian." - 420 Shades of Blaze 2015
Rits;-;Headshot simulator.
Vic;-;Global Offensive began development in early 2010, and while details on all stages of the game's production remain scarce, it's more or less known that it was heavily troubled by design conflicts, clashes with the community's desires, and not even developed in-house at Valve (passed off to at least two other Seattle-based development studios, with Hidden Path Entertainment fully developing the game until release). It was touted as a reinvention of Counter-Strike in general, aimed towards new players and especially, console audiences (one year and a half after release, both console releases have become entirely redundant) and featuring new, community-designed game modes (two Gun Game-inspired modes under the umbrella "Arsenal Mode", which has now been all but abandoned by Valve). While the game was in a disastrous state at the beta's launch in December of 2011, its premature release in August of 2012 did offer a much improved experience... but it still simply wasn't ready for release. The console versions themselves were poorly made, and the main PC version offered few features, few maps and an overall lacking gameplay component, especially on the competitive side. Now, close to December of 2013, two years after the game first materialized as a closed beta, it's safe to say that after a full year and a half since its Steam release, with consistent, robust and uncompromising post-release development by Valve, CS:GO is a completely different product. With the makings of a balanced monetization platform in the Arms Deal systems (paving the way for a possible free-to-play re-release), huge new additions in gameplay and graphics alike, and a renewed and refreshing focus on the competitive side of the game (both in-game and out of game, in some of the many prominent LAN tournaments), CS:GO has reached a point where it's clear that it has become equal, if not superior to CS 1.6... and make no mistake, this could be only the beginning for the game. There is still much room for improvement - certain aspects of gameplay which hamper the experience for both casual and hardcore players (aimpunch, weapon balancing, and the lack of proper tutorials or any reliable way of explaining deeper mechanics); the lack of content outside of the main "Classic" game mode and the lack of support for the nigh-deprecated "Arsenal" game modes (honestly, a control point or holdout or VIP mode could go a long way towards giving players more to do). I also feel a broader selection of weapons (both base weapons in the buy menu and sidegrade loadout weapons) and equipment could freshen up a static and rigid gameplay formula (which in Dota 2, for instance, changes radically every six months). For the most part, however, this is Counter-Strike, as deep and skill-based as it's ever been but with adjustments and improvements which help it feel more modern and dynamic, without compromising its core gameplay mechanics. If they play their cards right, CS:GO could end up being greater and more expansive than either of Valve's previous multi-year, post-release and free-to-play game experiences (DOTA 2 and TF2). Either way, now's the time to get on board; and for the mandatory horrendous pun for my closer: now's the time to go, go, go!

Am1r;-;Sick Counter-Strike game, with a bad execution on how the game was developed, but for sake of growth, ill play till i die
Speedy;-;Skin addiction
fury;-;CS:GO mixes up Source and CS 1.6 gameplay. The recoil and the flashbangs are more 1.6 like and the rest is pretty much Source. In CS you have no aim-down-sights-feature what means that you have to control your fire by shooting short salves or single shots. You can also learn the gun's spraypatterns by holding down fire-key and noticing the bullet-impacts (on distance they aren't really noticable but on short to middle ranges it works pretty well). In long range firefights people mostly strafe left and right, shoot single shots and try to hit their opponents head (unrealistic.. but interessting and challenging). You can duck pretty fast but it has almost no effect on your precision. You will be slow and more vulnerable. Flanking is hard in this game, because there is no sprint and maps are designed to have clear, mostly open ways. You can hide in only very very few situations because mostly you have great visibility (It's a bit bad and sometimes irritating that you can not disable blood decals). Mostly the only cover you can get is behind corners or of course headglitch-positions. In this game you can not go phrone or lean around corners. I think leaning would be a nice addition but no.. this game is still remains classic. Armor is more helpful than it was in Source. To me it feels like it's more important to land headshots. Because of that it's rather unlikely to get wallbang-kills. It's hard to spray, there is not much hit-slowdown and armor is very powerful.. and sometimes wallbanging feels a bit random. The sound in this game is good. You mostly hear exactly when people run, shoot or jump. You can mostly locate loud players really precisely (unlike in most modern games, where you mostly have crazy boominess or randomized sound.. because of perks for example). Counter-Strike is mostly comprehensible. Some maps got a really nice overhaul (dust2, dust1, aztec, office, militia, mirage).. Train and Cobble are very different compared to Source or 1.6. Personally I don't like them that much.. Inferno is very similar to the Source-version (they only changed some wall textures and made some minor changes). It's good that Valve changed the hostage rescue mode. Now it's more tactical and more objective based, but I think this mode doesn't work that good with the old map layouts. It's sad that there are only very few new competetive maps. Instead of new official maps there are buyable community-mappacks which are available in competetive and causal matchmaking for a period of time. The ability to find or buy weapon-skins is new in CS:GO. On the one hand it is cool to have camos on your guns, on the other hand it's bad that you mostly find bad looking and/or bad quality skins (or cases). Most camos look very colourful and not realistic. If you want good looking skins you most likely end up buying the skins for real money (on the steam marketplace). Conclusion: CS:GO is a new CS with mediocore graphics (the textures are mostly 512x512 pixels and could be better, sometimes the bloom- and post-process-effects are a bit annoying and also some animations could be better), reworked maps, new recoil and still not perfectly balanced guns (but it's fine). It has most things that the old CS-games already had but also some new things. There is ranked matchmaking, a great HUD and an easy to use replay-function. It's also very nice that you still have dedicated servers. You have the possibility to make your own maps and use server-mods. These are all great features that every modern FPS game should have. If you want to customize the look of your guns, you will have to pay for it. It's very very unlikely to find good skins and the amount of skin-drops is limited to 2-8 drops per week. All in all I think CS:GO is a game that continiues the series in a moderate way. It could be better but it could also be a lot worse. Since this game is not too expensive I can recommend you getting this game.
Abubuyoi;-;Get high ping enemies, try to kill, die, spazz out and get kicked. 12/10 would play again.
Mally;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive truly is a game like no other. In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you are tasked with globally offending as many people as you possibly can in 30 rounds, with an array of tools such as mic spam, teamkilling, or racist bullet messages. It differs from the original Counter-Strike (Known as '1.6' because there are 1.6 people still playing) in the fact that it's not 37 years old. Counter-Strike Hardline refines the tried and true formula of Police (Voiced by Nolan North) vs Counter-Police (Voiced by Troy Baker), bringing in many new faces to each team, such as Jewish Toad from Super Mario Bros, a black guy, a ghost with a beret, and a hot topic customer. Counter-Strike: Black Ops adds exactly 3 new zones for you to wreak havoc in, bringing the total amount of maps to 1, but makes up for it with a large arsenal of over 70 weapons, which I will now list for you. -Ak-47 -M4 -AWP All in all, Counter-Strike: Global Defensive is a robust top down open world third person beat 'em up that tweaks the gunplay to its best, with amazing graphics and sound design, it's bound to keep you hooked until Counter-Strike 5. 0/5
Tianity;-;The Ultimate FPS shooter. If you are an FPS fan this is the game for you. High skill, fast paced rounds, intense gun battles. If you are one of the few people on steam who don't have this game, I highly suggest you add this to your collection.
LukeO;-;One of the best games i played. I bought it, thought nothing of it. Played it again a month later and insantly got addicted, since then i've not came off it. 10/10 would buy again. 0/10 would buy a key again. :@
Dhmas;-;Best FPS game ever, no Netcode problems no glitches no  One thing i hope they fix it, that there are too many cheaters in the game .
MarshMallow/AFK until 7.20;-;Best rage simulator of the year. buy this if u like to play with 1.hackers 2.south east asian monkeys 3.Russians it's also a good way to help u learn Russian
Paed;-;Have yet to earn a killstreak 1/10
cHILL.relaX;-;I hate it, took my virginity
Sophie's Little Helper;-;In my opinion, this game is still very young and undeveloped and all the hate against russians is stupid. I mean i'm not one to talk here i hate them sometimes aswell. I realised something when i was playing one day, the game has gone trough a lot of changes and that it was slowly turning into a moba like game, where rank is more importand than having fun. How valve changed CS for me made me yonder and ponder from the time when i was playing CS 1.6 or CSS. Back then there where no rankings nor matchmaking and the servers where flooded with ads. I really hate how people neglect the times when people were fun to play with. Now people only care about how big your rank is, and how expensive your skins are. Where are the good old times? To me this game is a mess because of the ranking system and i mustn't recommend it for players from CS 1.6 OR CSS. Sure there are different mods, but people mostly play competitive and try to force their rank down your throat.
Samcole;-;It's CS, of course it's good. :3
Shintaro Kisaragi [];-;Pretty good game overall. If you're bad at FPS's or you aren't very good at aiming, I don't recommend playing because you'll most likely be called an "Autistic " by "pros". Then next round they get knifed and you can't help but laugh at that . 9/10
Ducky on the beach;-;It is kind of hard to say I do not like the game after > 1100 hours of gameplay. It is very addictive! What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that makes the difference. But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers. I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition. Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc. The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time. Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player! Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters. And their patience level with newcomers is about 0. So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:) If you can't practice in a competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play? Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training. And training does pay off! Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good! Still playing daily, and still loving it! So... recommended? Hell yeh! NB I just have to mention that that laguage used ingame is really bad... Maybe thats just my feminine view., but I think it extremely childish and limited to the same scolding words over and over. Quite pathetic to be honest. I learned to ignore it. Loving the mute button! I just hope that it is not a reflection of those people irl. That would be really sad.
Arrowsmith;-;Best chicken designs and animations. 10/10
get_high;-;I don't really know why Global Offensive costs less than Source, but nevertheless, this is a great game, the successor of a real legend. It's a little hard to adapt if you come from games like Battlefield or CoD because of the recoil and no sights, but if you are dedicated, you can master it in no time. If you are a fan of shooters, you MUST play this game... but warning: it'll be addicting as hell.
Fish.exe;-;Love this game highly recommend people to get it lots of fun. But not fun when you have silver's in your team >:I
arcane sex god;-;arms race is just a camping game, casual is full of bronies and furries. the only thing that i would recommend is competitive with friends. Even if you guys are getting stomped you'll still have a few laughable moments, not for everyone but still a must get if it's on sale or something
You like Chris Hanson Mr?;-;Don't...even...bother... not picking up this game! This game has changed my life completely. I'm now sober (6 months! I know, still keeping my fingers crossed, because of my relapse last year), and I'm also off Heroin. Last year was a difficult year for me, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer, something about the way I rest my laptop on my left testicle that managed to cause internal bleeding. Ever since I picked up CS:Go a few months ago, I've stopped resting my laptop on my testicles, instead I've been resting my testicles on my laptop. I thank the developers of this game for creating a masterpiece, and creating a beacon of hope for when I needed it the most. Graphics:8/10 Audio: 7/10 Gameplay:9/10 Life Changing experience: 9001/10 (Thats over 9000!) Thank you source team for bringing me Counter-Strike: GO
sG | thorgot [MGR];-;Probably the best Counter-Strike since Counter-Strike: Source!
Vladimir Pistolitov;-;Best russian military simulator on the market. You really get drawn into the atmosphere when your allies scream " BLYAD PIDERAS" 50+ times. After an extensive session of CS:GO you really feel like you are half russian.
Matt;-;Well, this game is amazing, and is very different from the past Counter Strikes. Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key. Also many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be "like" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add "bots mode" back. Counter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10
Abhorrent Log;-;It is not offensive to me. 0/10
miau;-;Just use The Awp. 10/10
Nagy;-;its a good game
Patrick #MFF2K15;-;I didn't know what to write about in my review, so here's a recipe for pancakes instead: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon white sugar 1 1/4 cups milk 1 egg 3 tablespoons butter, melted 1. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth. 2. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
LdSuShi;-;AWESOME! Fun and action non stop! Much better than CSS.
Kirk Lazarus;-;This game gave me a 7 Day ban because my internet went out and I couldn't join back fast enough, piece of trash imo.
Angstrom;-;I love to play Office Counter: Strike Source. This game is great you have to stop the troops, and win the war. My favorite rifle to buy is the pistol because it's free you should try out the pistol gun when you play.
Eternal [twitch.tv/etrnlwait];-;Simply put: one of the most competitive games in Steam. Recommended.
Nyanpassu;-;me: okay guys, go eco xxx_putin_xxx: idi nahui american kid Angry russian kids will teach you native rus in no time. 11/10 would c.y.k.a blyed nahuuuuuui again

So Hard;-;They go pew pew, then you go pew pew. oh  times running out go defuse the bomb. Feels gud man.
fluffybeard;-;Gave me extreme autism and PTSD. some guy called my mum a scurvy wench also not bad
JIDF Agent;-;this game causes school shootings apparently buy it and prove the SJW soccermoms wrong!
Deus Ex Mana;-;This game is so uguu. I play with my friends its full of ha-to and burning passion of nakama. I like when I get the gun and I shoot with much incredible sniper action. The p90 is also the most kawaiiest gun I have ever seen and it makes my mune go kyuuuun. I highly recommend this for tomodachitachis and oniichans that want to have the most tanosi time together with incredible feeling building within nakama. Highly recommend to buy 'kawaii killer' sticker and dress up your guns like idolmaster game.
Lucky;-;Its cool I guess. Spray a 20 / 30 MAC10 rounds into someone from 2 ft away hit him for 2 shots and 20 - 30 damage, he no scopes with awp insta kills 110 damage... Jumps around wall and insta headshot kills you with the AK47... AUG that as long as you ADS has no recoil... I use to laugh and say at least you can't quickscope, its ing worse than cod, nearly everone who uses AWP, QS's and generally wins most gun fights since you can't run quickenough to evade them, 2 or 3 AWP users set in the right place wipes your team since they just spray the smoke grenades till they hit you, oh and the wallbang most cover too, still 1 hitting... Fun for a few hours till I have to turn it off before I break my mouse or voice box screaming at my monitor how  he killed me or how he just pre fire wall jumps me and then kills 4 other guys all spraying him down with SMG's and AK's which he procedes to ignore and just act as if no one is hitting him...
beardATTACK STAFF @ fren;-;On Counter-Strike: Global Offensive since the announcement lay a huge responsibility. After all, the continuation of the legendary series of online shooters , a fan is a vast community will not tolerate the slag or just serednyachkovoy game. Benefit , Valve and not the studio that dares to disappoint their fans. Two years later, the clockwise and 691 held in opposition to the special forces and terrorists , I can proudly say that CS: GO is really failed. Even more than . Before continuing my review , it is worth noting that the only worthwhile game mode and remains to this day a bomb clearance , ie confrontation 5x5 , 30 rounds of 1 min. 45 sec. , In which the attacker must detonate a bomb at certain points , and protection appropriate to allow this to happen. One of the major advantages is the fact that CS: GO this type of game ( with minor changes ) placed in a separate section of the menu called ' competitive mode ' . Introduced a system of titles that helps you find a match according to your skill. In CS 1.6 and CS: Source competitive mode by default absent and was available only on certain servers , specially tuned for this type of game. The gameplay is not changed . Actually , nothing changed and is not required , a familiar mechanic works on hurray . Fixed characteristics of some weapons , something removed, something added to the overall picture it does not have nearly no effect. Shooting became more random, yes. But perhaps the most realistic FPS in the moment. If multiplayer shooter from you wait not fancy graphics and ballistics believable and interesting gameplay, then welcome to the CS: GO. Valve managed to make an almost perfect balance of gaming devices. With proper skill you can neutralize the enemy with a much more powerful weapon . Pistol rounds in CS: GO is not known to sink without a chance and an opportunity to take the round even with poor economies . But the most important advantage is the ratio of Valve to his fans . Almost every week there is a free upgrade , changing the gameplay for the better, in order to achieve a perfect balance . Approximately every six months out extensive additions cost 5-7 dollars with soccer fans cards that are available in the competitive mode. That's not counting skins for weapons that can get special opening drawers. In addition to all Valve maintains its competitive community , sponsoring tournaments large sums . And I am delighted that the number of people playing CS: GO, is increasing every day . But on the other hand it is the community CS was for me the only problem in this game. Because it often turns into a competitive mode into a farce and mutual humiliation. The only solution - only play with friends. Total we have a great continuation of one of the greatest franchises in history. To purchase required if gaming is important to you the gameplay itself . Best multiplayer shooter at this point, in my opinion. - beardATTACK @ fren
Enigma;-;Matchmaking sucks. People quit way to often. Never put with a full english speaking team. Always got someone crying for a weapon drop. Always one  chasing chickens. The community is filled with 8 year old CoD fanboys. Even if your the best, your a noob. End up spending way to much money on skins that don't mater. SO yeah, 15/10 best game I ever played.
yis;-;*casual intensifies*  blyat waller
burritow0w;-;This game cost me 4 girlfriends, $300, a social life and my high school grades. 10/10 would derank again.
Violet | Sweeping~;-;What I've learnt from this game: ~Little kids who scream into the mic everytime they die or you kill them ~Get a knife and everyone treats you like a god ~Knives in real life cost $10, knives in-game go for $50-$400. 10/10 ~If you want to learn russian quickly, this is the game for you. ~Make 1 mistake and your whole team blames you ~I don't always throw flashbangs, but when i do, i flashbang my own team ~Can't aim for crap ~Those types of people who think they're cool, good, and insult others because they're bad ~Kill chickens and you get points for doing so. So THAT'S where kfc gets their chicken. ~Unbox cases and get nothing but beautiful battle-scarred blues ~Your friend unboxs 1 case and gets a rare stat trak factory new knife. #Logic Overall: 7/10 would play again, but needs conga and hats~IGN
Nicky_;-;I unboxed a $130 knife so i enjoy this game very much... -me
iNvadeR;-;Very nice game. Recommend to all the CS fans. ~ 9\10 ~
snh;-;10 years later and I'm still playing the same games... What can I say? It's amazing. :D
Mr Hanky;-;100 hours. I know its not much but ive learnt alot. 1. If u dont click on their head hard enough, they wont die 2. Its impossible to get off of silver 3 3. I play it like its call of duty 4. Dan doesnt like playing with me 5. Harry cant use anything except the dak dak 6. Adam has played nearly 70+ hours more than me even though we bought it at the same time 7. Double zooming is for scrubs 8. Paul's a Cuunt 9. Michael screams like a girl 10. Everyone that is good at this game is 9 years old 11. This is the game were the word 'cumpts' was born 12. Pat is a try hard 10/10 ign would recomend to people who like doing the shooty shoots but with stategy
QueCast #SUMMER;-;Its great :)
Kieran;-;I joined arms race but I still used my legs 1/10
PureSodium;-;Thanks to Counter Strike I now know that the true meaning of friendship is to kill your entire team with a fire grenade and get a week competative ban. 10/10 -IGN
Anthony;-;AWP:Global Offensive is a great first-person shooter. In this universe , getting a knife is way harder and more expensive than getting guns. Also, soldiers here have to pay for their arms.
Kiku~;-;I'll just be straight-forward with this; this game is for ones who enjoy FPS, Counter-Strike games, and PvP. If you are one that doesnt enjoy those things then this game isn't for you. You will be faced with a lot of frustration and will regret purchasing this game. Now for those that do enjoy those things stated before, this game has better graphics than the previous CS games, intense competitive FPS matches, remakes of nostaligic classic CS maps, and new fun casual game modes like arms race. So yes, I will recommend this game, for those that love FPS.
Tails;-;Once again, Valve never fails to deliver an epic title such as Counter Strike. For years, the Counter Strike community was divided into two titles: Counter Strike: 1.6 and Counter Strike: Source. But now thanks to Valve's latest Counter Strike adition, we can finally bring back the family all together. The addition of skins are all bonuses that make Counter Strike: Global Offensive even more enjoyable, following Team Fortress 2's hat and drop system. The money being used for E-sports for the best to take place in. The competitive rank system that finally matches players equally based in terms of skill and tactic, as well as giving you the prestige for winning. The game is not perfect, but then again no game is. But what seperates most games from this one is the fact that the beloved developers of Hidden Path Entertainment are always listening to the fans while working together with the top players to try to achieve the perfect gameplay (although there are many features that could be similar to DOTA 2 to make it even better, but Valve will learn soon). Thanks to this game more and more people are joining the community of this game and we should all work so that this game, or should I say franchise becomes the best First Person Shooter series EVER!
CraigerStix;-;CS:GO is like banging a hot crazy chick. Occasionally you will have brief moments of pure ecstasy and brilliance, but in the meanwhile you will have to put up with hours of misery and frustration, and lose a ton of money in the process.
Kinson;-;This game is good and this review is pointless.
Ferrous Nightscar;-;Do not buy this game. Sorry for anyone who likes this quickly thrown together peice of  but in my personal opinion it's a crap. 75% of your deaths will not make sence meaning wallbang through none penetrable walls, cross map no scopes through solid objects, enemys constantly knowing your location, spraying down enemys at extremely close range 50% of the time dosent kill them no matter if you unload a mag or not, Shotguns do not kill at point blank but snipers instant kill you on a leg or toe shot, Feels like the game is on constant headshots only with most weapons. I appologies for i sincerly HATE this game and i do not recommend it to anyone nor to my worst enemys. It's torture.
Camper!!!;-;The game to get u addicted for coming years

BirdyGurdy;-;Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.
V3LL1;-;10/10 , Would go AFK again.

hue.pitastrudl :-D;-;Great game. Worth the money, I even preordered it when it came out. It offers lots of fun and meeting new people and not only that, also you get drops.
LoLPawlosek;-;Really worth Buying.
Dee Snutz;-;I bought this game with high hopes and regards from the commmunity. Yes I may only have 8 hours into this game but that doesn't mean I can not give my opinion. Community -I bought this game on a whim, I heard from everybody about how good it is so I decided to give it a try. My first game I had to listen to some guy yell at me because I did not know what I was doing. I quickly just brushed it off and went to another lobby after the game. I encountered the same exact thing. The community complains about how outsiders look at the game and that is because the community drives them away. Don't get me wrong, there is the occasional nice guy/girl that will help new people but they are few and far between. Do not even get me started on the cash grab that they call crates and weapon skins. Gameplay - The game has a steep learning curve which I enjoyed at first. But then the errors of the game became a little more clear. There were obvious hitbox issues when I played, which of course people will say is due to skill, and the shot registration just felt sub par for a game held on such a high pedestal. Gamemodes - The gamemodes are simplistic and easy to grasp onto. It took me a round or two to understand the objective. I have no complaints about the gamemodes/ Price - Yes I understand thast this game was just $15 but you can not defend a game just because you didn't pay full price. That is like if somebody goes out to eat and they have a gift card, and then all of the sudden the food isn't as good as they usually make it because he is paying less. There is no justifiable reason. Verdict - I gave this game a chance, I would say that 8 hours is plenty long enough to come up with an opinion. I never go home and think to myself "Lets go play some Counter Strike." If I do play it is because my friends pester me about it. I can see where people can enjoy the game but it is just not the game for me.
X666;-;Can't recommend this game before Valve fixes competitive matchmaking rank system and damage registering.

[FaZe] Kate Upton;-;This game. This game was once fun. But updates have gone by and valve has brought out the hammers. Guns have been nerfed and guns have been made better. But, now. Valve shows you. A new update. Much Idea. Much well thought out. Goodbye Game. Hello delete button. You know the saying F*ck B1tches get money. Well, f*ck this game then go out and get a life.
Bu11et;-;Average Competitive match dialogue: -You have connected- -Russian 1 has connected- -Russian 2 has connected- -Russian 3 has connected- -Russian 4 has connected- Me: "hey guys" Russian 1 and 2: "blyat" "" Me: "..." -After Warm Up- Me: "lets rush B" Russian 2: "nyet" -Whole team rushes mid- Me: "Guys don't rush" Russian 3: Muffled speaking -30 mins later- -score is 3-13- Me: "Guys, the bombs at B" -Russian 4 goes to bombsite A- Me: "GO B" Russian 1, 2, 3 and 4: muffled argument -bomb explodes- -next round- -Russian 1 has team-killed Russian 3 and has been kicked- -Russian 2 has left the game resulting in a 7 day ban- -Russian 4 is asking to be kicked- -Russian 3 is suggesting we surrender- -Remaining team rush mid again- 10/10 would recommend Counter-Strike:Global offensive, it truly lives up to the "Global Offensive" part of the name.
Muaz (   );-;much more realistic graphic,a lot of fun,Worth the prize!
GermanScope;-;Love it :D <3
lagos-;-;It's such an amazing game ! Everything is fantastic in this game, especially the graphics ! The game mods, custom mods, and the custom maps are full of fun.
EgehonK;-;For Those Who Wants To Learn Seriously First of all, the game respects to the original Counter-Strike soul. What I mean with that; Close combats, mid-range combats, long combats, auido, personolized CFG, grenade training, team-work, using communications are still have great affects on the gameplay. So far what has changed? First, graphics and phsycs has changed. Weapons has changed, community has changed, players has changed, match-making has changed. I will explain everything what i mean by those but first things first. For old players from the times of 1.5 or 1.6 (or even older) You may difficulties adapting to phsyscs and new gameplay. As I said players has changed, and the teamwork has changed. There will be a lots of people telling you what to do. Why are you flashing, why did you smoke there, how didn't you heard the defuse but believe me you will understand that all after a few hours on the game. With the new ranking system ( I will explain this furter too.) there is much at stake. Your efforts and skills will affect you teammates ranks in competitive mode. Let's start to explain; Matchmakin Mode (Competitive) 5 to 5 serious matchs, instead of an 32 player 16-16 server which people often go crazy run around, rushing CT's. You will experience a real clan match. For example, after you accept the game on Dust 2 if you leave the game you will have a punishment for 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 7 days. Same punishments for killing to much teammates or killing a teammate after the spawn. After you have won 10 games in competitive mode you can see your rank.(Search google for further reading.) Ranking system is a revoulitoun for me. Like in chess you will face with opponents in your same skill level and that also offers a chalenge: To up rank but also there is a risk to de-rank. Ranking system works on different ways and have a lots of different derrivatives. For example winning matches while the opponents have higher ranks then you or having a 37-5 K/D. Believe me ranking system is your friend Weapons Remeber the times that AK-47, M4A1, AWP, Desert Eagle were over power? Forget it and also say goodbye to a lots of weapons including MP-5 (one of my favs.) Goodbye to scout... Say hello to PP-Bizon, SSG,P250,Nova... With these changes you'll have a very expanded area of weapons to chose, MAG-7 is op in close combat, SSG has its pluses such as you can shoot straight while jumping. five-seven has a great armor penetration CZ-75 is an automatic pistol that you can rush with in an eco round. The reason im telling you all these because you can choose your own weapons considering you style. Are you a rusher? Get your P90 ready 50 bullets, low recoil high fire rate, you are a close-holder, get a mag-7, you are good on sniping and pistols? get your ssg. Options are much better then it was in 1.6 or else. Also do not omit the skins and market. over 100 skins for weapons, 10 different weapon boxes near 30 different collections. Trade up contract, keys, operation bravo-phoenix. Thats not something that I can explain. You need to see it yourself and feel the difference. Audios are better, community updates every second, you can report cheaters, phsycs are nearly awesome then every other fps games. (yes including CoD). Go and get the game, do not wait for price to go down. You can make that money in game with selling weapons on the market for the time being. 14.99$ for this game is like paying 40.000$ for a masseratti. (And masseratti doesnt helps you to make your money back.) Trust me if you are searching for a great fps experience, this is the most exciting game for time being.
blueflame17;-;Great game, until you start playing it for real. In competetive you run into people who are many ranks higher than yourself, or people who got another steam account, then bought the game again, in order to kill nubblets. It is also not too rare to run into hackers or people that should not of been placed in the rank they currently are. Then in casual, the same thing happens. This games matchmaking is horrid and needs a complete revamp.
Iwinz;-;Puppies are cool because they are like dogs.. but little.

Qraxulz;-;What I like: In CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive) I love how there are camos/skins on weapons because no other game is like it. I also love how they're are a workshop where you can create skins, maps, stickers, ect. CS:GO also has a lot of people playing it so if you are playing on a random server, you are guaranteed to have other players on there. The fact there are servers "you" can make. What I dislike: The fact there are smurfs that play with silvers and just make there games horrible. I mean this is not me since I'm not in Silver I'm Master Guardian, but that has nothing to do with this review. Anyways I dislike how they removed Operation Vanguard from the maps because I loved Season and Workout a lot. I know you can still get the maps off the workshop and still play it, but it's just not the same. I think valva should add more things to do in the tutorial so begineers understand more about the game. Sorry if this review is not good, I have exactly made a review about a game before.
Crafty?;-;You either die as a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker.

DarkestPower3;-;Counter Strike is one of those games where no matter how much you play it you never have the same encounters. It is fun and thrilling and should be Game of The Year every year!
'Witte.exe - AFK until the 24/07;-;Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it. Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best. What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills. Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check. As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players. The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play. It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases. If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression. There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible. At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available. When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as "same old" to us. This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it. And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.
Iron Woodside;-;I love all Counter-Stirkes, this one is pretty good. Personaly there are so many mechanical flaws that desrupt the whole game all together. This game can become rage inducing to certain extents. One notable flaw is the poor lag compensation and certain match making glitches for Competitive Mode. For the past 2 weeks, this game has been brutal with high pings on every single server I join. I'm getting banned for weeks just for having a poweroutage; some teamates accidentally either walk infront of you fireing a weapon a few times or walking into a HE grenade; and you get a ban/kick for their own fault. I enjoy this game at very few times, but not enough to be worth what it is. I regret buying this game.

IF;-;An intense, story-driven game written by the community, brought down by glaring flaws. The plot revolves around a bunch of screaming manchildren locked into a constant battle for guns with paintjobs. Hack wars commence, scams are carried out, and viruses are created in an attempt to gain any leverage possible. As one of the many players of this war, you must choose your allegiances properly. Will you simply be another "casual" and be called every name in the book by others for poor performance, race, sex, etc? Will you become one of the elitists and make money off of the guns? Or will you maliciously assault your fellow comardes and enemies alike with verbal harassment? Unfortunately, your character is outnumbered and outgunned. He must be a hyperactive drug addict, as he can run around at speeds that would make a Ferrari blush with near-instant acceleration but cannot shoot straight to save his life. He can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness, but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill God rather than the other humans shooting back at him. Fortunately, your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are, so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy. Of course, a lot of times, much higher-skilled players posing as low-tier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies. These people are called "smurfs". They function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction. Beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking. Of course, there are also hackers. Some are possible to beat, others are not. They have added advantages, such as x-ray vision, computerized aiming, and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds. Have fun with that. The soundtrack is poor, as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds, and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing. Valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack DLC, which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7. This is a very shameful business practice, and one has to wonder why EA gets fluff for this but not Valve. The graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original XBOX and lifeless environments. This is said to make the game competitively playable, but everyone knows good video games like Call of Duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision. The optimization is rather poor as well. On my state-of-the-art 2011 laptop loaded with an Intel HD 3000, the finest in graphics card technology, it gets a pitiful 25 FPS in menus with performance usually worse in-game. This leads to frustrating deaths as I see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face, or I suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face, in which they will usually taunt me with expletives. This is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade. My computer can run Crysis. The loot system in this game, however, has much potential. The guns you can get nearly rival Borderlands The Pre-Sequel in originality, design, and neon colors. However, unlike Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, the guns cost real money on either the outside-game service Steam Community Market or by opening cases, which cost $2.49 per attempt and usually only yield Common-grade loot. This is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base. Gearbox clearly has it right, as unlike Valve, they never release overpriced DLC for their Borderlands series. As Valve have shown they cannot design games, they should hand off Half-Life 3 to Gearbox Software instead. Overall, this game is outdated, treats customers like crap, has little content, unintiuitive gameplay, a terrible community, bad level design, and more. Stay away and buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 17 instead. 69/420

AddictedPro;-;Counter Strike: Source to me is one of the most fun games I have ever layed hands on, and Global Offensive does not dissapoint. This game is easy to get into, yet difficult to master. You can play competitively, or casually, on various well-designed maps with a great and large community. You can try out Counter Strike: Source for a couple of bucks less and if you enjoy it, then this game definetly is a must-have.

Rexzilerat0r;-;Death is a great teacher.

Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical.

There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet. Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC. If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game, with the following special bits:

PartY;-;I used to be an Xbox addict. But after playing this game, I have now stopped playing xbox for months. After all the years of playing COD i have finally figured out why I never had a girl friend. I was alone, played alone, lived alone, I thought it would never end... Then my friends told me about steam and after a while I found this game, Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I was excited to play it, i played it everyday NONSTOP until i felt like going to sleep. One day, I woke up and of course started playing cs go, I noticed what i have became...a csgo addict. I didn't know what to do when i was thinking of that. I quickly shut off my computer and went outside for once. I thought about what i was thinking...I decided to go back inside, still trying to get it out of my head..."a csgo addict". I started crying...I didn't know what to do. I couldn't stop playing now...I have only just begun. I looked at all the money i had left and wasted it on cs go skins. The addiction is growing. I couldn't stop it even if a tried, thats when i realized...that i have fully became a cs go addict. To this day, I'm still a cs go addict. I love cs go and will never stop playing it... 10/10 Ruined my life that i never had...

HaWk;-;BEST GAME EVER. I was a COD addict but now IM A CSGO ADDICT. SO MUCH MORE FUN AND INTENSE. WAY BETTER THEN COD OR ANY OTHER SHOOTING GAME. BEST IF PLAYING WITH FRIENDS!!
brutalistu;-;It's different than previous installments in the series. The recoil of the weapons is dramatic and infuriatingly unreal looking. It's very possible to almost completely miss a target standing in front of you at no more than 1 meter (gamewise meter) and deliver only one hit with the AK. The AWP for example isn't the surgical instrument of death no more. The shoot area isn't a dot (the dot in the center of your reticle) but a quite large "box". Also the physics of it seem a bit off, I cannot understand how you can be stopped from running from being hit with a smoke grenade, HE grenade, flash bang or molotov/incendiary. It is ridiculous and reminds me of the old stuck-in-the-ground with smoke launched at feet bug in Counter-Strike 1.4. I have the frustrating sensation that I am constantly playing a BETA game, a BETA I have purchased. Also lots of cheaters in Competitive matches. Competitive matches were supposed to be the bread and butter of the new series but the experience is very often destroyed by obvious cheat using players. I guess it is so easy to cheat in this game since there are lots of them. The Overwatch isn't helping much and participating in the Overwatch program ruins the faith in this program because 4 in 5 demos submited to Overwatch have players blatantly using wallhack. I guess the Overwatch can VAC ban one and while 10 more players start using it. In spite of all it has potential, it looks good and the maps, the old ones and the new ones added, are interesting and fun to play.

rip;-;Teamwork and skill are the standouts that gap this shooter from many others. improves on previous CS editions with imporved mechannics and alot of balancing along with micro-purchases. this game is highly addicting with a strong emphasis on co-operation and and mental strengh teamed with aim and many other factors. with the goods there are still problems; the biggest being the community, with many people hacking or generally being a pain in the . I highly recommend this game for anyone that loves shooters and competive games.

Just trying to rank up is literally impossible seeing the people that actually play this game either greif, hack, or flame. And it's pretty common to start a game with a useless bot because people don't know how to manage their time. It's about 1/5 chances you will be put in a good PUG and not only that, the game is infested with hackers. Every holiday the game goes on sale for basically pocket change and hackers just ruin the game. Good luck getting in a game with people who actually have common sense.

Rainbow Cookie;-;Best shooter game made with Awesome skins from others who made it Its also awesome cause we can make custom skins and let others see it and rate it !
Ank;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter and the next generation of Counter-Strike running on updated Source Engine and has many new features added. The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. This means slightly less weapons recoil and no need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further. Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system. Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving. You either die as a noob or live long enough the get a title hacker. This is yet the best Counter-Strike game where casual and hardcore gamers can play. I recommend this. Rating 9/10

If this happens just block them and keep playing. Also probably the 30% of players do cheat regularly. Don't be fooled by the amount of hours a players might have. Even the ones with 2k hours do cheat. Also the 90% of player with new account that play good are either smurfers or cheaters(mostly cheaters). All said, have fun.

Pyro <memeware.net>;-;CS:GO is probably one of the best multiplayer shooters out there, it offers such great gameplay and wide variety of gamemodes and maps to choose from. Counter-Strike has been around since 1999, and has grown since then. CS:GO may not please every 1.6 fan, but it has a lot to offer to the Counter-Strike scene. It has official competitive matchmaking, and supports the eSports scene of Counter-Strike. Most Counter-Strike major tournaments are hosted by GOTV and other sources like Twitch (which you can find on the main menu). It offers a ton of new gamemodes you made of heard before like "Arms Race," (AKA Gun Game) and "Deathmatch," (A all out Free-for-all). These gamemodes make Counter-Strike more friendlier to the casual players of the game. The old gamemodes are back in the modes Casual and Competitive. Casual is mostly for pub servers because it offers a more casual experience to the standard Counter-Strike gametypes like de_ (Bomb defusal) and cs_ (Hostage rescue) by turning off team-killing, always buy the essential equipment like Defusal kits and head armor. In the Competitive gamemode, it brings out the standard Counter-Strike competitively accepted settings. (some are modified like: Bomb time not being 35 seconds and instead being 45) This gamemode is for people who want to queue up with their friends and have a serious match with other players in competitive. Team-killing is allowed and many other hardcore settings to please the competitive audience. You might say to yourself, "Well, since teamkilling is on, doesn't that mean people can grief in competitive?" Valve has implemented ways to stop griefers and trolls from ruining the game experience. Everytime you team-kill someone, you get a competitive ban that can go up to 7 days, and even a year, which means you can not play the competitive gamemode for how long it lasts! Valve also has its own community Overwatch service, which detects cheaters and griefers. Overwatch lets you watch competitive games and see if someone is griefing or not. The Overwatcher determines if the person is griefing or hacking. Then, the report gets send to Valve for a final confirmation. This has helped the CS:GO community get rid of hackers and griefers off of the competitive scene. Speaking of the community, the CS:GO community is pretty friendly when it comes to new players. Most veteran players are willing to help out to teach everyone the basics of the game if they are having trouble. Many guides on the steam community guide page teaches new players on how to handle weapons and such. I rate this game 10/10, this game is near perfection when it comes to multiplayer shooters and it is a must have for every steam account.
SkilleX;-;This game is pretty fun. Very addictive. The reason why I cannot reccomend the game is how much the developers want out money. Making new cases, operations and other rubbish trying to bribe us into buying their . Valve make great games and stuff, but their community is terrible and justin bieber supports his fans better than Valve. The servers are laggy even with a good ping since the new updates. These are just a few reasons why I cannot reccomend CSGO.
EndridFPS;-;Very addicting game. The strongest point this game has is its history. The game has been around for over a decade. It has a very steep learning curve, and a high skill ceiling to match. The most vibrant competitive scene of any FPS on the market. You can see my full review of the game here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xQXscUV_wQ
Bordermick;-;Great FPS, love the trading and the competitve gamemodes. Also, EZ SKINS EZ LIFE
Jack | RIP, Satoru;-;It's important to appreciate games like this for what they are, and this game is a callback to a past chapter of video game history that's been buffed and polished. And unfortunately as someone who never actually played the original Counter-Strike games, I'm not in much of a position to judge exactly how well they pulled this off. Basically, it entirely boils down to the kind of person you are. If you're a die-hard Counter-Strike fan, then this is probably all you can ask for. If you're a more typical gamer who just finished playing Crysis or Battlefield and wants to pick up something to play over the weekend, then trust me when I say that this is NOT the game for you. It's the online FPS equivilent of Dark Souls, in a way.
Jacoby;-;Good half, guys! Well played!
Matty G;-;This is an extremely mixed and short review. I think the game has cool and original gameplay. Though it doesn't highly innovate, it stills maintains the Counter-Strike gameplay that has been going on for about 15 years. Let's talk about the community. About 5% of the people you meet on Global Offensive are really nice people. 95% think they're MLG  and WILL kick you if you're not very good. I've been kicked multiple times and it feels awful, to think that people don't want you on your team. Makes my stomach drop to the bottomless pit. Seriously, beware of the abysmal community and stick with your friends. If you work together with your friends to prevent the opposing team from winning, you'll have a much better time than you would being John Rambo. But now I'm going to say this is an amazing game and I totally recommend playing it if you like competetive, slow-paced games then play with a group of friends, you'll have fun.

-=[PAK]=- VeNoM JaCKaL;-;So Counter Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest revision of the long running Half-Life mod fps. Created by Hidden Path the game is more of a refinement towards modern day military shooters then previous instalments such cs 1.6, cscz and css. This is mainly to allow a more broaden appeal to the masses of COD and Battlefield generation. You see CS generally has always had a very hardcore user base that is highly skilled. You'd be lucky to find yourself top of your first few games as a beginner like you could do in the fore-mentioned rival franchises in competitive multiplayer. How have they achieved this and to what extent it is successful is down to personal preference. The newly included arms race and demolition modes allows for a more fast pace and tightly confined CQC mode that allows the players little to no down time unlike the traditional bomb/defuse or hostage maps that most players are familiar with. For me though these modes are not the real meat of the game and if youre an experienced player these will only be glanced over and served as a side show at before delving into the traditional modes. The inclusion of some new weapons and equipment helps to change up csgo such as the Molotov and allow for different variations of old school tactics. Most of the well know maps are available from the offset and the workshop community is as good as it gets with newly created maps, game types and weapon skins to name but a few. There is the introduction of operation payback whereby a selection of community maps are promoted and available for players for a small fee across the whole of csgo and some of these are a delight to play. So why would you choose this over css for the experienced player. I find that it adheres to the original 1.6 far more closely then css ever did. The aiming is tight and follows the recoil sprays on many of the automatic guys far more closely. There are many updates that valve and hidden path are pushing though, such as spectator mode, competition spectators i.e. Dreamhack, newly released weapon finishes through drops and crate drops and newly revised maps being released mirage and cobble to name but a few. For me the main reason for this instalment above all others if the great competitive mode. Ranked csgo was never really available unless you sign up to a league such as ED, played pcws or cups. Now however with competitive mode 5vs5 ranked games are a blast if not for a few small problems that really need to be ironed out. These include dropped players being replaced by bots, hacking and over watch submissions, uneven rank matches to name but a few. If you though take the game as it meant to be played as a highly skilled social and fun game then the latest version of this simple but vastly complex game will delight you as it has me.

Nick;-;Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.
Ditto;-;CS: GO stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety. Valve has not only updated the shooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries. This is Counter-Strike, whatever the format you choose to play it on, and there isn't a higher recommendation than that.
twitch.tv/ghandimcfarland;-;Whether you're a casual FPS gamer or a very competitive hard-core player, CS:GO is where it's at. A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value. There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option. CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals. It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!). Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics. You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky! I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS). The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000! It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5. With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot. Don't be discouraged by the learning curve. With great effort, comes great rewards! Now GO buy it!!

Revan The Wounded Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

Chris;-;it was onsale after i buy it 0/100
pentium4;-;Too many things are wrong in this game,movement is not smooth, awp and deagle are innacurate and not fun to play anymore, p90 and running is , flashes are not efective, nades are not accurate, limited wallbanging and  ammo limitation on M4, maps cluttered with unexpected props and corners to slow you down, certain areas are not wide enough and causes acidental TK on rushes and inability to rush fast as an whole, and the most important, recoil does not allow you to kill multiple enemies in 1 magazine in a short period of time, you are limited to short bursts and take cover, and that removes the ability to clutch rounds which was the most fun aspect in other versions. It prevents good skilled aimers from carrying a team. Also most maps are really bad unbalanced copies of CSS maps, like inferno and train, and people are forced to pay for operation passes to play extra maps in matchmaking. On the other hand there are many improvements in money and weapon balance specially on ecos, and other misc stuff like the GUI, matchmaking and de_nuke balanced, and I would rather play GO with this problems fixed than going back to 1.6 anyday, but at this moment the game is not fun anymore and gameplay is not fully oriented for competitive gameplay. I only play it because nobody plays the other versions anymore, and most people have to eat it up. This game had very low player count before the steam market update since the game was really bad, but after it many people started playing it to earn skins, so most of the players dont care about the game, they just idle for drops and watch streams to know on wich teams to bet on csgolounge, they dont actually care about the game, it is a sad truth and its clear that Hidden Path will never update this game to proper conditions.

JPOC - THANKS NME!;-;This game was the best tactical game I had ever played. The community was good, people were mature, sportsmanship was very well presented. But all of that changed when the skins came. The community of Counter Strike that we knew and loved got shattered in an instant. This community is turning into TF2 but instead of hats it is skins. It's a pathetic excuse from valve to build an economy to make more money off of virtual items. Really valve? You are turning this game into TF2 and it's a joke. More immature underage children are playing this game now and I don't like and I am certain that I am not the only one who thinks this way. First off, the community now is a disgrace. You could be playing with someone, become really good friends with them and then they ask for one of your good skins to "borrow". BAM! Skins stolen and your hard work has meant nothing. It increases the scamming within this steam community. Second, the competitive mode is great. It is challenging and very teamwork based, but all that can change with a steam sale. Hackers banned? Well then let's price Counter Strike: Global Offensive to 3.50. Oh boy that was a good idea right? A steam sale on this game is not only hurting us but steam as well. People also buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive on a different account, so that means if you are a low rank in competitive not only are you against a higher rank but you are also at a high chance to lose. It's a complete and utter disaster when it happens. It needs to end. Thirdly, Cases are ridiculous. You literally have a 0.01% chance to get a "Rare special item" (Knife). People waste so much money on cases when at the end of the day it's a "Virtual Item". You could go out and buy a real knife for about 50 at highest while the highest in this game is about 600. The economy is terrible. Community is terrible. Skins are a joke and Steam are probably laughing at you as you go out and waste money on cases. Fourthly and lastly is the, "Hit Detection". This game has a pretty bad hit detection system. Valve could go out and buy 124 tick servers but nope! they go out and be cheapskates and buy 64 tick servers which is god awful. I mean Valve, Come on! You make millions of  and $, why can't you actually just think about your game instead of how much money you take a bath in? This game is great once you get into it and "IF" you find a decent server (124 tick) it is pretty fun. One other thing I forgot to mention is when you play competitive there is a cooldown if you "leave", "Kill a teammate", "Kick too many players" or even if your power cuts during a match, you only have "3 minutes" to return to the match. Abandon the match? Ok sir we give you a 7 day ban. A ban ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours to 24 hours to finally 7 days. It is a bit unfair the banning system. It is automatic so it cannot be revoked. Please Valve, fix your game and your community before it wrecks itself. 6/10 for Gameplay 2/10 for Skins 3/10 for Community 0/10 for Competitive Cooldown

2rad2be2sad4u;-;If you get a case, you pay to buy a key. With that key you can open the case. Then. You get something totally . When you get that you can either use it in game. Or sell it.

PapaDelta138;-;Counter-Strike. The game that lives up to its name. So simple, yet so much fun. It could be considered the game that began competitive first-person shooters... Or at least to my knowledge, it is. And compared to the other Counter-Strike games, I gotta say... CS:GO was okay. Graphics are nice, old-school maps, and the new item drop system is a nice addition. But, now, the only reason I play it is because I'm playing it with a friend, or I just want a drop that I could sell, no matter how pathetic it would be, or I just wanna waste time. You would find it awesome at first. But, at some point, it didn't give me something CS 1.6 gave me, and still gives today - Thrill. I won't say it's bad. But, then again, your money's probably well-spent on this game on sale... Or well-spent on something else.

Sif;-;This game should really be taken off of steam, the game is filled to the brim with smurfs and hackers. I have tried getting into it with friends on three different time and each time i get more dissapointed. The ammount of players never changes. The only reason they still have it as one of the top selling games is because of all the people buying for alternate accounts and its just sad that they have to do that please don't give valve money for this trainwreck they get enough from all the smurfs and hackers buying it for their alternate accounts.
sara_bear;-;Massivly played and lots of fun.
Flamov;-;Initially I was very hesitant about this game; it seemed very risky to make so many fundamental changes to a formula that was barely changed through Counter-Strike: Source and Condition Zero. However, seeing how much Valve has listened and continues to listen the community, and how quickly they make changes in both the short and long term, it has completely restored my faith in the game. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is incredibly fun and feature-rich, with plenty to do for both casual and competitive players. On top of this, there is also plenty of ways to promote and support eSports, which is a much-needed and fundamental step in reinvigorating Counter-Strike in the competitive gaming scene. However, the most important thing with this game is that the community is incredibly nice and friendly - and with a game as difficult and intense as Counter-Strike, it's extremely welcoming. Good stuff!

Also they have X-ray vision and they magically hit you in the head every time they shoot but that;s okay, it's not like he's hacking or anything right? 10/10 most logical game ever would buy again
SajBear;-;One of the best multiplayer games ever made, hands down. It always makes me come back for more. Teamkilled my best friend with a grenade too! 10/10
frips;-;I have to say, originally, I did not want anything to do with this game. I have been a big fan of the series since starting with Beta 4 way back when. After CS:S was released, I was very content with the way the series had been progressing. The updated gameplay and graphics gave me a boosted interest in a game I had not played in several years. When Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was released, I was not feeling the same way. The frantic and well edited trailers made the game look spectacular, that is until I noticed it was still running on the source engine, albeit a modified version. Given the hefty price tag, I stayed away from CS:GO for as long as possible, until I noticed how many updates had been made since the first CS:GO beta, and the subsequent gold release. It was obvious, the developer planned on putting as much effort into maintaining the game as they were to keep the game fresh and even competitive. Once I finally bought the game on sale for a decent price, I realized what I had been missing. Competitive mode has changed the way the game feels and works. It was very easy to get bored playing CS:S, because as the popularity increased, so did the servers. Pretty soon you were competing against 32 players on the opposing team, making for a hellish free-for-all, despite the team based combat. CS:GO found the perfect solution by introducing a competitive game mode. Instead of having to play with your friends in 5v5 tournaments, CS:GO incorporated a 5v5 mode that mirrored the professional experience, making it a lot more fun to play. The fine-tuned competitive mode, coupled with officially supporting death match and the arsenal game modes, making CS:GO a game with a lot more re-playability, and a lot more fun. Some people are critical about the inclusion of skins, turning CS:GO into Team Fortress 2, but they fail to recognize the importance of customization. The skins don't really impact the gameplay, and are not overly obnoxious like some of the content included in TF2. In addition to the developer created content, the inclusion of community created weapon skins and operations allow community members to profit while increasing the awareness and fun of the game. I am not a fan of DLC, especially since most DLC is lack-luster overpriced content that should have normally been included in the game at launch, but was separated out to pay-for downloadable content in the interest of pumping out sequels and printing money instead of focusing on quality. CS:GO however, chooses community content to include, and gives back to the authors who continue to breath life into the game. Overall, I was skeptical when it was first released, but the developer's constant attention to detail and genuine intention to keep the game balanced and competitive has made this the best game in the series. I highly recommend fans of the series update to CS:GO and enjoy themselves.

Tibi2001 - maclaWei;-;The latest installment in Valve 's Counter-Strike series brings us great, addicting gameplay, a colourful, alive world in a game that combines great mechanics, with great performance. It is my second most played game, soon to become the first. The item drop system is similar to the one in Team Fortress 2 . At the end of a match you may or may not receive an item. A skin, a weapon case, you never know ! The best way to play, is to play competitively. The game has a Matchmaking system, that finds you a nearby server to play on, with 9 other players to fill your 5v5 match. This is where you have to play good, where you have to win. After your first few matches, you will be given a Skill Group. That, is your rank. It's based on your K / D ratio, and the amount of wins and consecutive wins you've had in previous matches. The Matchmaking system's job is to match you with players of your level. If you don't wanna play serious, though, you can still hop in the thousands of servers with random stuff! Deathrun, Zombie Survival, Deathmatch, you name it! It's still tons of fun. But the real deal is in Competitive. So, what are you waiting for? GET IT ! Unsurprisingly, I give it a 10 / 10
Navourr;-;'Counter-Strike: Global Offensive' is an online multiplayer FPS shooter made by Valve. With the hours I've spent within this game I can confidently state that those hours were not wasted. This game offers more weapons, an item system, new maps, improved graphics and incredibly improved content from 'Counter-Strike: Source'. The game can be ran on non-up to date systems due to its adjustable graphics settings which will also allow the user to enhance the graphics. I can confirm that the game runs smoothly and is not jumpy which prooves how good of an engine the game has. Pros: - Smooth FPS - Incredible graphics for a Source Game - Balanced PvP - Item drops (makes the game that much more worth playing) - Wide variety of maps (+dlc) - Good players are rewarded within certain game modes - Players that leave during a competitive match are dealt with correctly Cons: - The Weapons and hipfire take a-lot of time to master (if not played a source game before) - Match Making Server System in the Competitive mode sometimes has one team where the majority of the players have a much higher ping (avg 100+) - Demo's sometimes (90% of the time) don't play correctly and are jumpy Overall I give the game 9/10 and highly recommend this game.
FusionZGamer;-;Spent over $150 on cases & keys trying to get a knife got a ton of mp7 skulls 10/10
Benny #;-;You can set the water on fire. You can survive gunshots to the head. You can tank a grenade from point-blank and still survive. You can chase chickens. Chickens can(t) chase you. You can only kill fishes if you throw a nade in the water. Shooting them with guns of any caliber will not harm them at all (Why no fish scales-made armor?! ) You can fall from 20 meters and still run perfectly fine after that. You can get shot in your arm and still be 100% accurate. You can lose all of your money(real money,for skins) and not get anything good. Digital knives actually cost more than real knives. You can lose your mind. You can't swim. Chickens. 10/10
Hannah :*;-;Game is good, fun, etc. Rank system doesn't work. Call of duty haven't rank system and is more balanced than counter- strike! Smurfers everywhere.
ivo;-;Welcome to CSGO! Let me present you the players you will be matched with 90% of the time: Your Team: 1. You (Only one that has mic on team) 2. Cyk4 Bly47 (He is deranking to Silver 1) 3.

Fluffy;-;Counter Strike Global Offensive is a... let's face it, if you don't know what this is you need to climb out from under that rock. CS:GO (as it's often abbreviated to) is rewarding to those with skill, and punishing to the casual gamer when played in competitive mode. To get the best of out this game you need to invest time and effort to learn the maps and the spray patterns of the guns. Watching players with high levels of skill is like watching a football match on TV. Even if you don't like the game you appreciate people who have skill at this game because you can clearly see when a player knows their stuff and when they don't. This game is more of a sport hence it's overwhelming appearances in Esports tournaments like ESL and Dreamhack etc. Overall if you are looking for a bit of fun for an hour or so, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME! To get the best from this, you need the practice regularly and get a team of people to play with, then... it's brilliant.
moshvl;-;left me missus for this game and lost my job worth it because now i am nova 2
Sean;-;This is a great addition to the CS series. The maps look fresh, the models are great, and the gameplay is as tight as ever. The competitive mode offers a very quick way to find (relatively) balanced matches. One drawback though is the frame-rate issues the Arms Deal update has introduced, which many are experiencing and Valve don't really seem to be looking to fix any time soon.
BadKitty -- GM200-310-A1;-;TL;DR: STFU AND PLAY! Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is designed to be competitive and only competitive. If being competitive is your kind of fun, then this is definitely the game for you! Take note that if you have a high competitive rank, do not use matchmaking during or after Steam sales! You will be queued against blatant hackers who will just pull your rank down. Valve's method to address this issue is by limiting the wins of unranked players to 2 per day. This is supposed to make boosting services more expensive, but if your mom has the $$$ then it won't stop you from being a dumbass GE. As for lower ranked players, the only thing you should worry about when the game goes on sale are smurf accounts. Since the game was designed to heavily punish players for abandoning a match and to limit the range of skill groups, many players have resulted to purchase more copies of the game -- possibly a copy for each day of the week and for each range of skill groups. This is a flawed system created by Valve, and I doubt it will ever be fixed. Clearly, Valve just wants to sell hats -- or in this case, stickers. In my opinion, competitive cooldowns are stupid. Competitive cooldowns a.k.a. temporary bans are given to players who abandon a match. This is good for promoting competitive play and all, but the current implementation for detecting an intentional abandon is completely  (ret4rded -- good job flagging this word, fagg0t). If you have random connection issues for a mere 5-10 minutes -- possibly due to terrible Internet Service Providers, this will immediately be considered an abandon, and you will not be allowed to help the four teammates you are clearly in a party with. If you are live streaming on Twitch.tv and get DoS attacked by one of your viewers, you will most definitely be given a 7 day cooldown every single time you live stream. If your game crashes in the middle of a match due to VPK errors and are forced to verify the integrity of your game cache, or if Windows Update decides it would be a good time to install updates and restart your computer... /gg. Whoever thought it would be a good idea to give a cooldown to a player who team-kills a bot in order to prevent it from giving away free guns and knife-kill rewards to the enemy? Please, for the love of GO, CS-GO KILL YOURSELF!!! CS:GO bots, just like in DotA2, are incredibly stupid no matter what difficulty you set them to. They rarely follow commands and will most likely give the bomb as well as their gun to the Counter-Terrorists. Bomber bots has been "addressed" in a previous update by allowing players to take the bomb from bots. The A.I. remains the same -- stupid and unresponsive. Overwatch is unreliable. Overwatch allows low ranked idiots with zero map awareness to be the judge whether a Global Elite is cheating or not. Valve's idea of being qualified and experienced enough to become an Overwatch investigator is based on numeric variables of your CS:GO activity. Basically, all you need are 150 competitive matchmaking wins, a decent rank (not Silver), 500 hours of your game idling in the background while you watch anime, and an account with low report counts (a.k.a. nobody reported you for being better than them at the game). If low report counts were to be the only qualification to be an investigator, then eventually, everyone skilled enough would have been reported by some newbie. Does this mean the newbies will be the only ones left qualified for Overwatch since higher ranked players were reported by idiots? Only time will tell... Overwatch is in a way pretty useful for detecting blatant all-out cheaters but extremely inadequate for spotting casual cheaters with minimal settings and who are very good at portraying Romeo and Juliet . This is because Overwatch only shows the investigator out-of-sync portions of the actual demo based on events triggered by the suspect. This makes it seem as though every suspect is using an aimbot especially with the low tickrate being used on the official matchmaking demos. Yet another waste of a very capable idea, Valve. On the bright side, competitive hostage rescue actually works really well compared to older versions of Counter-Strike. Carrying the hostage, instead of having the incredibly intelligent A.I. of every Valve game ever developed follow you with blindfolds on, makes the gameplay a lot more credible. For those of you who prefer playing casually, you are better off playing Counter-Strike: Source. I find CS:Source more casually fun due to smooth movement especially for kz, bhop, surf, and trikz style game modes. Sadly, the CS:Source community is now officially dead. It would be common for people to assume CS:GO being the cause of the dead CS communities; however, this is not the case. People get bored eventually, so they end up looking for something different to try out: a new game, a different genre, or even a different lifestyle. The only thing CS:GO did to these older communities is to possibly hold on to what is left of them by allowing them to merge as one. If Valve/Hidden Path were to introduce a matchmaking system in CS:Source and maybe even in CS 1.6, I am sure a lot of players would pick their preference. Clean bunny-hopping is possible on CS:GO if and only if you use hacks or server-side plugins with sv_enablebunnyhopping. Therefore, this may not be a game for all you BHop pros. Surf and air-acceleration still work though; however, it is not as smooth compared to CS:Source surfing especially on 64-tickrate servers. Not to mention, the game randomly stutters so much that it is impossible to do anything with precision and accuracy -- memory leaks? With the default value of sv_airaccelerate increased from 10 to 12, this makes it a lot easier to reach those certain jump spots that everyone enjoys doing. Good job, Valve! Now please increase the damn matchmaking tickrate or at least give us an option to choose! Speaking of options to choose, Valve has completely removed the sv_enableboost cvar which in turn killed the CS trikz community. /rip Overall, CS:GO is a good replacement for CS 1.6 fans and possibly for those CS:Source players who don't even know what air-acceleration does.
Michael;-;Best phallus simulator I ever played. First of all CS:GO is a game about magic. There has more magic than Harry Potter, Narnia, and our wallets on Steam sale. +You will get all the d**ks at your head +You will get almost all the magic by Ak-47 and other magic sticks +When an operation stars, the magic increments X1000 -They nerfed CZ75-Auto +Instead of CZ75, you will get your  r***d by TEC-9 GG (This analysis is subject to have many changes from me in the future. Sry for bad english :P +don't took too seriusly this analisis)
steel;-;Very solid legacy to counter strike 1.6
Lady Dildozord;-;Ugh my favorite game, hands down. So addicting, nice graphics, accuracy is better after the last update. I love the skins and the competitive maps. On point.
Moysey89;-;this game is really good, one of thew best in its genre! now you can unlock new weapons/skins it has made it even bettter, one of my best buy on steam! deffo worth every penny! :D
Haziq_As'ari;-;"Childhood Game Remastered.." 10/10
Russ (lovely cat);-;Don't buy this game if you are a casual gamer that does not enjoy spending money on virtual gun skins and boxes of pure misery. Well i do enjoy this kind of games, so i guess i've already blown off quite a bit of money on it already, and more is to be dropped into Gabe's wallet. If you play in Europe, there is a big chance that you will be queued up with russians. they tend to only speak russian to you, and nothing else which is kind of annoying. I do find the game itself quite entertaining and frustrating at the same time, but i do reccomend it if you are into 1st person shooters where the hackers are almost non-existant. i r8 8/8
Silkizuad;-;I went competitive, and after a while I was the only one against 5 enemy players. I killed 4 of them, but then the last guy killed me. I got kicked off for beeing a noob. 11/10 would play again
AzoNe;-;Another game in the Counter-Strike Trilogy. At first i didnt like it, but now after all the updates and since it got more famous in the editing community then i gave it another shot, and i have to say its a very good game! The recoil might be a bit weird, but youll get more used to it over time. CS:S is the best game ive ever played, so its weird getting used to, but you can master it. A lot of nice ideas with this game, and the community isnt too bad. The skins.. Eeerrhhh.. I dont know, but its a genius idea from VALVe and also a goldmine for them. I do enjoy collecting the skins and stuff, but its not like i want to pay 120 for a knife skin, thats just ridiculous. But the game is very good and polished, and definitely worth a try if youre a CS fan. The competitive side in this game is really good, and probably the best side of the game. Its just too amazing at being competitive. One of the most perfect games to play serious in. A little thing to the bad sides though, when people shoot, and till they actually hit someone seems to be.. weird. Theres a slight delay from shooting till it hits and that is what i find most difficult in this game really, the recoil you can learn to master, but this is just not good. Editing in this game is ruined compared to CS:S, you cant remove all hud, or well, you can but it can be tricky and it shouldnt be. Also the deathnotice pops up later than in any CS which can ruin hard cutted edits too. And as i mentioned before the delay on the shots also ruin the editing a bit, so yeah. I dont know what more there is to say other than that i enjoy this game and its competitive side a lot too. I highly recommend this game if you like CS and just FPS games in general. I would rate it 9/10 JUST because of the delay on the shots, if that werent there, i would give it 10, so please VALVe, fix this if you can and it will be one of the best FPS's ever! Anyways, thanks for reading and i hope i helped you to make up your mind to buy it or not.
Sugar;-;absolutely loveeeeeeee this game!
KapitanAlien #noBiceps;-;I totally recommend this game to anyone who's looking for: fun, competetive gameplay and little big of rage :D
Alice.;-;Amazing game, Never knew so many kids had ed my mother nor' did I realise I'd get full marks on my Russian exam. GG lads.
Potato;-;buy this.
Emma Stone;-;let the fun times smashing keyboards and thinking that everybody who is better than you is a cheater and everyone whos ier is a noob begin
p0sTpWnEd;-;The only FPS you need to even look at. I'll never move on to another series.
Repulsive Bushman;-;Valvo says I own this game I don't own this game
Ra.;-;Realy Great game. [ 8.5/10 ] -They took everything that needed to be changed with the old CS games and made it better. -Great gameplay, nice smooth Graphics, the price is low and its realy worth the money, I could seriously buy it again :) -Also you will get that "good feel" when you kill a player/players because you know you have to work for every kill. -Highly recommended to anyone that plays any kind of fps games :) -Well that was only positive s*** now to the negative, hackers... they are everywhere, also drunk russians that tries to explain to you that you are worthless and the only thing you understand is "(haha no I'm kidding you dont understand a s***)" while they get killed faster than you can breathe and runs around with a knife more expensive than their computer.
Lil Fate;-;I would honestly think this is one of the best games ever created, it's a lot of fun even though it competitive. The only think that I'm really dissapointed about is that there's a lot of people who can't speak English properly, even in higher ranks.
Serby;-;This game was one of the best out there. I repeat: WAS! Can't recommend this anymore due to the immature community which reports you for every lucky headshot, and then you have the possibility of getting reviewed by some idiot Overwatcher and, when you're having the best time...VAC ban. Please, Steam, stop discounting this product and stop caring only about your wallet. You're giving hackers and smurfers more chances to ruin this fine masterpiece of CO-OP gaming. P.S.: I know 99% of you won't give a s**t on my opinion, but who cares about you gamers anyway. :)
!!!!jks / BUYING KEYS/ ITEMS!!!;-;awesome! :D u need to buy this!!
TyeDyedFox;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a wonderful game, with a nice community and provides a way to rack up steam money in your wallet! You can earn weapon skins and weapon cases and sell them on the market for crazy money! This game is DEFINETLY worth it.
Grozny;-;Super fun to play, but as a third person shooter it fails to derive from the standard formula of its genre.
Revenger;-;Yes yes and yes. Very fun! And one of my favourite games. It is very different from other games where you can just run around like a noob and expect to be the best player, this game is all about accuracy, tactics and team work which is great! There is always an intense feeling that I don't get from any other games!
Freelance Autist;-;this game. I would not even take this  if it was 'given' to me. Anyone who likes this game is a ing nerd.
Trop.gg;-;I killed a dude through a wall with an AWP and some Australian guy called me an "Sheep f***ing hacking f***head". Then vote kicked me. Yeah buy it.
ferret man;-;The FUTURE of competitive gaming. I expect to see every family playing counter strike together within the decade. Families gathered around the telescreen, waiting for that last final clutch. The father fires one shot from his polished AK, it's wooden gloss glinting in the sun of the map of the year. The shot rings out, from the speakers of the telescreen. In that moment, the son contemplates his life's future. He sees a happy family playing by a white picket fence, his arm around his young wife's waist as they plant the "SOLD" sign on the front lawn. The daughter sees her prince charming, as they walk down the aisle together into an endless union of love. The father sees his glory days from college, the boys in his frat, and the touchdown pass he made his senior year. The mother sees herself with the young football star she fell in love with, two young mavericks against the world. The shot hits home, the match is won. The family hugs, their joy clearly visible together. They climb the stairs to bed, and prepare for tomorrow's activities. Tonight was just another normal night, but together they've all experienced something they'll never forget together. As you lay in bed this night, picture that scene in your mind's eye. You, your happy family all gathered to enjoy the future of competitive gaming. That's what Counter Strike Global Offensive was made for.

Marios;-;ne of the most prominent multiplayer fps right now Counter Strike:Global Offensive is also one the most renowned! The recipe of success for this game was very specific and it is not neccesarily related only to its visual part or the sound effects. The technical sector works fine and will leave everyone contented! Nevertheless its charm is located to the intriguing way it puts you to cooperate with other players and deal with various scenarios either you belong to the terrorists or to the counter-terrorists. Additionally there is a big variety of different levels and modes where you are called upon to put your reflexes to the test and stressful situations demand speed and effectiveness! On the whole i strongly recommend this game if you are on the lookout for a Multiplayer FPS which is not only realistic but also fascinating.
Revenger;-;Yes yes and yes. Very fun! And one of my favourite games.

Matt.;-;A great fps. I'm relatively me to pc gaming so I'm more of a cod player but cs go is definately the better of the two. Great game to play with friends and I highly reccomend buying it. Cheap price, One hell of a game!
Origibro the Nalaholic;-;It's like quickscope simulator except you look like an idiot when you miss, like real life, maybe it should be called real life simulator then.
Badger;-;Ah Counter-Strike. What a wild mistress you are. At times you are loving and caring, offering great joy and hope. Then other times you are mad at me for reasons I do not understand and you cast me out; alone and unloved. First off, let me quickly say that the game mechanics are great. Every gun handles differently and you have to learn each one. It takes skill and practice and makes the game so much more rewarding. As a side note however, it's a bit irritating when you can only see a guys head (i.e, the gun is hidden behind a wall or something) and they can still shoot you. But I digress! So in this game you have a few different modes that you can play, and each one has a very different play style. For instance, in Arms Race, there is no time to be subtle. You need to get 27 kills before the next guy, and you have to do this with every weapon in the game. As soon as you kill someone, your weapon switches out. This can be annoying if you're fighting several people at once, but the game is so fast paced that it really doesn't matter if you die. Instantly respawn and rush back into the field. The speed of this game makes it great for some community banter. You play in a team, but as you are really only playing for yourself, it doesn't matter if your team are doing well or not. I'll come back to this point about teams later. Team Deathmatch is a fairly standard affair if you are familiar with any other FPS game. People spawn in and you have to kill them before they kill you. Simples! As this game mode is slower than Arms Race, you can afford to be a bit more patient. There is a timer instead of a "reach this many points/kills." Also, every now and then a bonus weapon appears, in which you'll get more points if you kill people with that. Respawn with this weapon and kill people within the time limit and you'll bag yourself some extra points. Person with the most points at the end wins. Again, this is a mostly light hearted game mode, and the community really shines through. Next up is Demolition, my least favourite mode. It is much the same as the casual/competitive maps in which you have to try and plant a bomb, but the maps are smaller. The main difference in this game mode is you don't get to choose your gun. You start with a weapon and then when you kill someone in a round you change weapon at the start of the next round. Kill several people and you will be awarded with some grenades as well. The reason I dislike this mode is people can get out of sync with the weapons. If you do really well for several rounds, likelihood is you will now be on a weaker gun, or a gun you cannot personally use well. While it's good to get practice in, the realisation is that the other team can simply be on better weapons, leaving you at a major disadvantage. Again, after a few rounds they may be on a gun that they can't use and it levels the playing field again, but those few rounds can really be an irritant. Now we are onto the meat and two veg. The bit the mistress both loves and despises. Competitive. In my time playing CS I have went from an absolutely horrendous player, having never really played many FPS's, to a fairly competent player. Over the space of a few months I went from unranked up to Master Guardian 1. I felt very proud of myself. However, the journey was not plain sailing. When entering a competitive mode, if you are not searching with friends, you can end up with wildly different experiences. This is where the community behind CS can really fall apart. In a match with strangers you can have a great match with excellent communication (which is really needed in competitive) or have really bad communication and a lot of name calling. If you make a mistake, sometimes you will be supported with a lot of "Unlucky, we'll get them next time!" or you will receive something along the lines of "OMG, YOU SUCK, NOOB, FFS, UNINSTALL." This is particularly true if you're the last one left alive and all eyes are watching you. This isn't just from your team however. I have had games where I have had great communication with the opposition, and everything has been really friendly, but well fought. Othertimes however, they are raging across the keyboard at you. Yes, you can mute players, and often you may have to mute the opposition, but it is quite another to mute your team. As I said, communication is really important in a competitive match. Even if they are only yelling obscenities at you, they may occasionally have insight into where a player is. A main problem for this is it doesn't even matter if you are winning or losing. Your team could just be massively unhelpful. I have had a lot of fun playing competitive matches, however as time goes on it is becoming less and less fun. This could be because of all the steam sales, with people buying the game and jumping on just to be irritating. Maybe they had been banned previously and have made new accounts or some such thing. It just doesn't make for pleasant gaming however. I don't play games to become annoyed and irritated. I play them as a release. There is nothing more satisfying than doing something well. I remember playing a game on inferno as the terrorist and I had went up B. I was to push up and give them a fright while my team was to go up A. As I went up Banana, two guys came down to me. I headshotted them both. It was then that my team were shouting down the headsets. They had lost the bomb at top of middle. Only one team member had survived. He went to try and get the bomb and was instantly killed. I was on my own with 3 opponents left. I turned back round at banana and went up middle. Two were coming towards me and I take them out. Sadly, I was down to 12 health now, and the clock was ticking. I knew that the last guy was up on the left at top of middle. So I went through appartments silently. As luck would have it, a team mate of mine had a smoke grenade that had dropped there. I threw the smoke into top of middle and as it burst out I went for the bomb, with 30 seconds left to plant. The final enemy started spraying into the smoke and I knew where he was. I shot once and killed him, acing the round (or kill every enemey yourself). I've had aces before, but that one was special. My teammates errupted with cheers, as that was a very important round for us. Had we lost we would have had to eco (which is to not buy so you can save some money). It was those cheers and the great support that my team gave me that makes me love this game. The community can be incredible. A quick note about casual is that it is pretty much identical to competitive, except with more players and thus less strategy and communication. Instead of only talking to your team, you are often talking to everyone in the game. The same issues with the community stand however. Sometimes they do a "clutch or kick" where the last surviving member of a team has to kill all the surviving members of the other team and win the round. This can be damn near impossible if your team didn't manage to do anything. This is often said when it's 5v1 or over. Often the community doesn't really kick the person, but I have seen it happen. I have also seen someone clutch a 6v1 and then got kicked regardless. So it's a bit of a hit and miss. Overall, I would highly recommend this game. The mechanics are solid and the community as a whole is really great. The support people give is wonderful. Often there is great banter to be had in the non-ranked matches. Sometimes banter can come into the ranked matches, but more and more of late it has just been abuse. If you want to try your hand at competitive you will need a thick skin.

SirCthulhu#RIP Mr. Iwata;-;Russian dictionary simulator!
-Zombie Assassin-;-;Although it is the biggest rage simulator out there, I still keep coming back to this game. Also, the community is rarely friendly but if you don't care about that, then definitely buy this game.
FIRE_KEEPER;-;Every-time this game goes on sale something inside of me dies. Thinking ( Here comes more hackers and smurfs ) 494,368 in game right now which is the highest peak it ever reached until now. EDIT : Now its 595,439 Anyway Csgo is a great game. I mean if you don't know any of the counter-strike series thats really bad because you have to, it is the basic fps game out there. In csgo it is even more fun and much more in-depth than Counterstrike:source. More modes more maps, and matchmaking systems and customize-able skins. I'v had a few people who don't know it thinking you buy better weapons with money. Nope all players same weapons just different colors ( Skins ) Thats all But the sad part of the game is having a lot of hackers, everytime it goes on sale = more and more hackers. Well that said you can play a lot of games without encountering one and just having some fair maps. But at ( Competitive ) mode you are most likely to encounter more hackers than you can count because thats the ranked mode in the game. Anyway, My favorite Fps on steam, I Loved Source so much but after getting into Global offensive i dont see myself trying source ever again. Also in this game you get weapon drops after finishing maps ( Random drops ) so you can trade/sell on market and gain some money, I got about 89$ from selling those stuff. good for people who wants to waste all their time on an FPS and still get something out of it.

I pee with a tube and a bottle taped to my Genitals, I also am sitting on my toilet 24/7. I have never gotten up from it nor will I ever do that... I have not showered in days EVEN IF it is five feet away from me. I have recently just gotten out of silver 1... hope I can put this on my college application... if I ever decide to go back to finish the 9th grade and so on and so forth. To make this long story short... 10/10 would buy 100x. P.S. I wasted most of my welfare on cases! :D HELP!
Badger;-;Ah Counter-Strike. What a wild mistress you are. At times you are loving and caring, offering great joy and hope. Then other times you are mad at me for reasons I do not understand and you cast me out; alone and unloved. First off, let me quickly say that the game mechanics are great. Every gun handles differently and you have to learn each one. It takes skill and practice and makes the game so much more rewarding. As a side note however, it's a bit irritating when you can only see a guys head (i.e, the gun is hidden behind a wall or something) and they can still shoot you. But I digress! So in this game you have a few different modes that you can play, and each one has a very different play style. For instance, in Arms Race, there is no time to be subtle. You need to get 27 kills before the next guy, and you have to do this with every weapon in the game. As soon as you kill someone, your weapon switches out. This can be annoying if you're fighting several people at once, but the game is so fast paced that it really doesn't matter if you die. Instantly respawn and rush back into the field. The speed of this game makes it great for some community banter. You play in a team, but as you are really only playing for yourself, it doesn't matter if your team are doing well or not. I'll come back to this point about teams later. Team Deathmatch is a fairly standard affair if you are familiar with any other FPS game. People spawn in and you have to kill them before they kill you. Simples! As this game mode is slower than Arms Race, you can afford to be a bit more patient. There is a timer instead of a "reach this many points/kills." Also, every now and then a bonus weapon appears, in which you'll get more points if you kill people with that. Respawn with this weapon and kill people within the time limit and you'll bag yourself some extra points. Person with the most points at the end wins. Again, this is a mostly light hearted game mode, and the community really shines through. Next up is Demolition, my least favourite mode. It is much the same as the casual/competitive maps in which you have to try and plant a bomb, but the maps are smaller. The main difference in this game mode is you don't get to choose your gun. You start with a weapon and then when you kill someone in a round you change weapon at the start of the next round. Kill several people and you will be awarded with some grenades as well. The reason I dislike this mode is people can get out of sync with the weapons. If you do really well for several rounds, likelihood is you will now be on a weaker gun, or a gun you cannot personally use well. While it's good to get practice in, the realisation is that the other team can simply be on better weapons, leaving you at a major disadvantage. Again, after a few rounds they may be on a gun that they can't use and it levels the playing field again, but those few rounds can really be an irritant. Now we are onto the meat and two veg. The bit the mistress both loves and despises. Competitive. In my time playing CS I have went from an absolutely horrendous player, having never really played many FPS's, to a fairly competent player. Over the space of a few months I went from unranked up to Master Guardian 1. I felt very proud of myself. However, the journey was not plain sailing. When entering a competitive mode, if you are not searching with friends, you can end up with wildly different experiences. This is where the community behind CS can really fall apart. In a match with strangers you can have a great match with excellent communication (which is really needed in competitive) or have really bad communication and a lot of name calling. If you make a mistake, sometimes you will be supported with a lot of "Unlucky, we'll get them next time!" or you will receive something along the lines of "OMG, YOU SUCK, NOOB, FFS, UNINSTALL." This is particularly true if you're the last one left alive and all eyes are watching you. This isn't just from your team however. I have had games where I have had great communication with the opposition, and everything has been really friendly, but well fought. Othertimes however, they are raging across the keyboard at you. Yes, you can mute players, and often you may have to mute the opposition, but it is quite another to mute your team. As I said, communication is really important in a competitive match. Even if they are only yelling obscenities at you, they may occasionally have insight into where a player is. A main problem for this is it doesn't even matter if you are winning or losing. Your team could just be massively unhelpful. I have had a lot of fun playing competitive matches, however as time goes on it is becoming less and less fun. This could be because of all the steam sales, with people buying the game and jumping on just to be irritating. Maybe they had been banned previously and have made new accounts or some such thing. It just doesn't make for pleasant gaming however. I don't play games to become annoyed and irritated. I play them as a release. There is nothing more satisfying than doing something well. I remember playing a game on inferno as the terrorist and I had went up B. I was to push up and give them a fright while my team was to go up A. As I went up Banana, two guys came down to me. I headshotted them both. It was then that my team were shouting down the headsets. They had lost the bomb at top of middle. Only one team member had survived. He went to try and get the bomb and was instantly killed. I was on my own with 3 opponents left. I turned back round at banana and went up middle. Two were coming towards me and I take them out. Sadly, I was down to 12 health now, and the clock was ticking. I knew that the last guy was up on the left at top of middle. So I went through appartments silently. As luck would have it, a team mate of mine had a smoke grenade that had dropped there. I threw the smoke into top of middle and as it burst out I went for the bomb, with 30 seconds left to plant. The final enemy started spraying into the smoke and I knew where he was. I shot once and killed him, acing the round (or kill every enemey yourself). I've had aces before, but that one was special. My teammates errupted with cheers, as that was a very important round for us. Had we lost we would have had to eco (which is to not buy so you can save some money).

iMza Luv Deek;-;This is not a game for people who merely wish to rack up immense kills, or boast about their three-sixty no scope headshot wallbang, because this is no CoD. This is a team-based, tactical shooter with many strategies and jargon. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not your average FPS. +Game Sense and Skill are very important when it comes to CSGO. What to expect out of particular opponents and the most likely situations you'll be facing is a key part of the game. If you wish to rack up kills, run and gun, and just barge into T spawn guns blazing with no plan, this is not the game for you. Skill is the most important aspect and the most unique aspect of CSGO, and in any Counter-Strike game at that. +You will gun, run, and be outgunned, but the most important part is to rise again and to learn from mistakes. How did he get me? What did I do wrong? Someone running around with an M4 and shooting every teammate in the face with a shot to the head does not necessarily mean hacks. Players can always be better (and most of the time will be better) than you, so you need to learn to be better than them. All in all, CSGO is one of the best games I have played. The amount of teamwork and skill here is more than what I have experienced from other team based tactical shooters. In short, if you are looking for a hard to master, easy to play competitive tactical based shooter, pick this game up. It's very much worth your money.

Bag +HDHRDTFL;-;Human immunodeficiency virus infection / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a disease of the human immune system caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[1] During the initial infection, a person may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the illness progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more likely to get infections, including opportunistic infections and tumors that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems. HIV is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.[2] Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV.[3] Prevention of HIV infection, primarily through safe sex and needle-exchange programs, is a key strategy to control the spread of the disease. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. While antiretroviral treatment reduces the risk of death and complications from the disease, these medications are expensive and have side effects. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[4]

JordieBG;-;The third game of the famous Counter-Strike franchise. The graphics in CS:GO are amazing , as well as the gameplay. This version includes more gamemode to play , weapon drops and weapon skinning (making weapon skins for Valve to add by submiting them on CS:GO's workshop.), its also a good way to make some profit for your Steam Wallet. You can do that by simply playing and selling your drops on the Steam Community Market. However if you plan on quiting durring a competetive match , its not recommended. You'll be given a few bans and after that every single quit will lead up to a 7 Day ban. CS:GO is like Counter-Strike combined with Team Fortress 2. It's a title that deserves the money. TL;DR I've invested too much to fall back now.
STEFan;-;This is the best game in the series Counter-Strike
Allison! [deaf];-;Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing ---------------------------------------- Overall Game ---------------------------------------- CS:GO has a lot of gameplay options for players - community servers offering a variety of game modes, casual gaming ranging from defuse maps, hostage maps, deathmatch mode, and a fast-paced Arms Race mode where you aim to go through each weapon until you get a Golden Knife kill to win. Beyond casual gaming, there is a competitive system that rank-matches you, similar to many other FPS games, and runs for up to 30 rounds of CS, after which your rank is affected one way or another. Competitive play is both extremely challenging and extremely rewarding, although some players either take it far too seriously or treat it like casual unranked gaming. It's hard to find a team that sits in the nice middle ground between the two. If you've played a shooter game before, GO will be familiar. WASD, crouching, walking (as opposed to running), and grenades. It's relatively straightforward gameplay, only made hard by the skill of your opponents. The game has a bit of a learning curve. Each weapon acts differently and may take some time to learn which you like and which works best in certain situations. After that, the grenades are the next thing to consider attempting to master. They often can turn a losing game into a winning one. The best way to learn is to play, so get in there and have fun. :D Overall Rating: 9/10 ---------------------------------------- Overall Accessibility ---------------------------------------- CS:GO is not very accessible for deaf gamers. The game itself has no captions that I have been able to find, but the only thing that would need captioning is the weapons tutorial that you're likely to use once, if at all. CS can consistently be a challenge to deaf gamers because of the significant impact of sound during play. Many players OFTEN sit and wait for the enemy to come near, reacting to footsteps or grenades/weapon fire that cannot be seen, but can be easily heard. One particular edge hearing gamers have over deaf gamers is guard the target area from a distance by listening for nearby enemies, only moving out of hiding when they need to. A deaf gamer's need to see the target site to properly defend it puts them at greater risk of being killed. Additionally, competitive mode gamers make heavy use of the microphone capability to communicate quickly. There are text/voice binds in game (using the Z, X, and C keys) that can convey significant messages rather quickly and easily, but I find that most hearing gamers at mid-level skill are not receptive to either the voice binds or to text chat. Deaf gamers in competitive gaming may encounter hostility or discrimination from hearing gamers. Rating: 3/10 Subtitles/Text ---------------------------------------- None, though none are really needed. Chatting/Communicating ---------------------------------------- Chatting is available for team and global chat during matches and while observing. Although, as I mentioned, some people are not responsive to chat, it is still offered.

Mysterious Ranch;-;I put a lot of time into this game and I got pretty decent at it, but it got to a point where victories were no longer satisfying and losses were usually the results of really salty teammates or smurfing/scripting enemies. I have over 300 hours and I paid $15 for the game, so I no doubt got my money's worth, but half of it wasn't even enjoyable. It really comes down to what kind of matches you get put in, but I think you'll find yourself getting annoyed with the game more than enjoying it past a certain point.
NEW ACC > id/kairos2001;-;I loved this game. I hate it now. It's riddled with smurfs, hackers and outright trolls. I'm sick of it. On top of all this my ranking system is ed along with my matchmaking. I get placed with a team of trolls and idiots whilst the other team consists of 3 smurfs DMG on main. ing cheers valve. This game is unique and the gameplay and mechanics are fantastic. However the game is dragged down by screaming children and trolls. I'm silver 3 with 97 wins and about 90% of my friends that are terrible at the game are a higher rank. I'm not amazing but I'm pretty decent. I top frag every game and I still don't rank up. Yesterday, I played one game. My team were a bunch of 12 year olds and trolls and I was up against 2 smurfs. Thanks. I get kicked, because the trolls think it's funny to kick people for no reason and then guess what? The rank I just worked 40+ wins to get is gone. ing gone. I'm done with this game. My ranking system is glitched/ed and my matchmaking system is . Why am I so unlucky? Just why. ing unbelievable.

GDM;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive CS:GO, 4th episode of CS... ( Counter-Strike, CS:CZ, CS:S, CS:GO) My rating 9/10 CS:GO is FPS Game, i think, that everybody knows CS, so we can move up to negatives and positives! Positives: Skins (You can earn or lose money on skins, u can buy skins, trade skins, open cases and EARN money from that, almost same like TF 2, but much way better!) Ranks - In game are few choices of types in game, From Arms race to competetive matches, when u must communicate, be skiller etc. When are u playing competetive, and u are winning, u will earn new ranks, u can drop cause losing, or rank up if u are winning. U can start on Silver I and after 100h u can be global elite (Global Elite is the biggest rank) Gameplay - Everything is smooth, good, awes00me. :D This is the main change i think, from CS1.6 and GO... everything is smoother, better headshots, competetive and more... its a really great game, not like CS 1.6... Tournaments - If u are very good, and u got very, VERY good team, you can sign to the tournament, it can be the "amateur" tournament (Night cup etc.) or the best,bigger,famous DreamHack, Copenhagen games, EMS etc. U can win skins, money, new graphic card etc. etc. Its really awesome! Neg4tives: Hackers - Once per month will show some cheater... but dont worry, Valve and their VaC bans got this^^ RAGE - When u are losing, lost your rank, got  team, its bad and u are starting to rage:D Kids - This game... some kids buying this, dont know why, but when are u big rank (MG I etc) No kids in your team anymore^^ If u like FPS Games, u played CS before (CS1.6,CZ or Source) You should buy this! Its awesome game! btw. Sorry for some gramatic fails, Im from Czech, so i cant speak ENG like a pro^^

Papa Franku;-;I highly recommend CS:GO , Counter-Strike:Global Offensive to all my friends because of the low price and the high replayability. With just this cheap game you will be able to play 10 times the time you normzlly spend on a triple A (AAA). I like they spend equal importance on the individual skill as they do on the team play. For me, this is the only real tactical shooter on the market at this moment. I like the high variety of maps and weapons and that they dont stop updating it with new operations wich offer new free maps and the ability to support the developers by buying these expansions (wich is totally unnecesary to be able to fully enjoy the game). Theres not only a casual matchmaking but also a competitive matchmaking for people who take the game more serious. Theres weapon skins to collect and trade and cases to open to try ur luck. This game litteraly has everything an fps needs and fps fanatics want.

Nomad;-;This has to be the best Matrix game Ive ever played. The Story: You play as yet another person who was awoken from the Matrix and rescued by a Zion ship. The entire game takes place during a very specific training simulation that every recruit that has to run before he can jack back into the Matrix again. The aim of this simulation is to familiarise the trainee with various weapons he can acquire as well as basic tactics employed by terrorists and counter terrorist forces. In addition, this simulation is good at building a sense of teamwork and trust between the crew and their operator (referred to as Strat Caller). The Gameplay: Of course, as we learned in the movies, most of these training simulations are far from perfect. Some of the code used in it has been written by people with no formal education and the rest was pirated from the Matrix itself. This is cause for many anomalies we can observe within the simulation, but some argue that these glitches help the player get that surreal experience of entering the Matrix after living in the waking world. Most of these are small things like weapon having the wrong magazine size, missing fire selectors, fresh magazines looking empty, wrong ammo types (AKM uses 7.39x30 lolwut?). None of these subtract from the core of this game, however: the tension of being the last one alive and having all eyes on you is addictive. This game is in many ways the opposite of what is sold on todays FPS market. While a lot of people are hyped and praise some developers for discovering the Jetpacks and high movement shooters of the late 90s, this game keep a slower, more tactical pace. The guns have massive amounts of recoil and any sort of movement can throw your accuracy out the window. This places weight on map awareness and positioning more than what you would find in your average FPS game. The learning curve is steep and it doesnt simply boil down to learning recoil patterns. A lot of the time, you can win engagements by simply having better crosshair placement or having better communication then the enemy. Knowing where the enemy is and what gun they are using can easily win you the round even if you are outnumbered. This game also challenges you in a very in-universe way. Sometimes, the game will place Agents on the enemy team which will have all the godlike abilities they have in the movie: they know where you are and they have perfect aim. This can be a frustrating experience for most, but nobody said bringing down an Agent is easy. The Graphics: They are serviceable. Not much to look at here, you can run this on a toaster. Just make sure you stay away from Vsync, you want this game to run at 200+ frames. It's also worth mentioning that this is so far one of the few games that run perfectly on nVidia's Dynamic Super Resolution feature as I haven't encountered any UI scaling issues. The performance impact was negligable for me. The Sound: There is a lot of room for improuvemt here. The guns sound very weak compared to titles like Battlefield 3 and 4. The AK reminds me of a high pressure nail gun. There seems to be a bug when it comes to the sound engine deciding on which channel to play a sound, as people walking to my left sound almost the same as people walking on my right. The final verdict: Grab it on a sale. Its a fun game to play with friends. Its also worth mentioning that it already paid for itself by giving me a bunch of boxes that I sold on the market place. I ended up using the money to buy a bunch of gun, which is also another addicting aspect of this game.
[TGG] 420-SmokaSizzle-70;-;Great game. The way them kids rage makes it worth every penny.
KANEDAAAA!!! TETSUOOO!!!!;-;Sprayed with my P90 and got a headshot from 100 feet away, i typed "Boom, headshot" in the chat box. The gentleman (or gentlelady) i killed replied with " u noob ". Good times. 9/10. Would've got a 10 but it suffers from a severe lack of hats.
Batch;-;Good game but russians are too  (deaf and blind) and they cannot speak english at all so you have to play with 5 man party without russians or live far away from russian server.
mosilver;-;I finally decided to write a proper review for CS:GO. So... I bought this game within a week of playing my first few games of Counter Strike: Source. I was not disappointed. I know it's a bit of a bore reading  like this but if you're looking for an overall 'view' on CSGO, skip down to the bottom for my overall view. Will you run it? Chances are you'll be able to run it... It isn't exactly the most intensive game so you'll probably be able to run it smooth at a constant 60fps with anything built less than five years ago. Community The community is nice enough and often help you in the form of them raging at you through the mic. Okay... So, the community... Isn't the nicest. Before people rage at me... Not all of the community is so bad, just the minority that can be... Pardon my language... D********... Some people complain about the russians, some of them can be quite annoying... Thank god for the 'block communication' feature but not all scream ' blyat' down the mic. Graphics If you're looking for a super aesthetically pleasing-Planetside 2 ultra looking game then CS isn't for you... The graphics aren't bad but it's not going to win any prizes either. What I will say is that it's a large jump from Source... Where this game truly shines is in its gameplay. Gameplay The game is largely skill based, and from what I've played so far, requires a large amount of dedication to learn maps and how to use each of the weapons. If you're coming from COD-like shooters as I did you're going to need to be prepared to spend hours of practice in casual in order to learn spray patterns, smoke spots and other subtle hints which can make a massive difference in competitive play. There's a wide arsenal of weapons, ranging from extremely short range (the shotguns) to extremely long range (snipers). Unlike other shooters with a wide arsenal of weaponry, each weapons has its place and time. Eg, 3 different rifles for each team (excluding the snipers). The standard M4 and AK for a full buy but also the famas and galil for a force buy, aswell as the SG and AUG if you're a baller. $_$ One of THE most surprising features of the game was the extremely useful nature of the nades. You'll go into your first game buying 0 nades, yet after your 2nd game they'll be one of the most utilised items in your arsenal. No. I'm not talking about that frag that kills everyone within a 5m radius in any other game you've played. I'm talking about the flashes, moltovs and smokes, in fact, even the decoy has its place. You'll end your 2nd game hating the frag however. Sure, it's good taking 20hp off a coupla people holding B site in Dust 2 but you sure as hell aren't gonna get any kills with the . As I said earlier, the community does help sometimes, most often in competitive however. Gamemodes There's 5 official gamemodes: Arms Race Deathmatch Demolition Hostage Bomb All official gamemodes are teambased, emphasising the teamwork element of the competitive game modes yet some gamemodes do not at all rely on teamwork such as Deathmatch or Arms Race which is based mainly on your individual skill. Arms Race Here, you'll be in teams however, as a solo player, you'll be looking to reach the golden knife first. You get points for each weapon kill which will help in the advancement to the next weapon level. Deathmatch Here, you are also playing as teams however, the main objective is to end the game with the most points. I think it should be renamed 'AWPmatch' personally, considering over 60% of the players use it. I sometimes wonder why people even bother using custom AWP community servers. Demolition Here's a gamemode I have yet to build an opinion on, having played it very little. Each kill every new round lets you advance to the next weapon. So what happens if you get multiple kills in a round? I hear you ask. FRAGS! Well, for each extra kill, past the first I mean, you get an extra frag grenade. Eh, f*** my  explanations, I'll give you an example. So, for example, you enter a round, get 3 kills and annihilate the enemy team. You'll advance to the next weapon due to your kill but also earn yourself 2 extra frags to use in the following round! Bomb So... I'm not sure about the official name of the gamemode but it's the gamemode most previous CS players will be extremely familiar with. There's Counter Terrorists and Terrorists. Counter Terrorists playing the defensive role for the main part of the round while Terrorists will be looking to head to one of the sites and plant the bomb. You start the round with $800 in pocket and looking to spend as efficiently as possible in order to win the pistol rounds which will leave you in good steed for the oncoming rounds. Each round starts with a counter of two minutes, which if the counter terrorists run down, will lend themselves a victory. Within this time period, the Terrorists will be looking to plant the bomb, shortening the round time down to 45seconds, which is the time taken for the bomb to explode. The Counter Terrorists then have to defuse within the time limit. The round is won by Counter Terrorists by either running down the clock, defusing the bomb, or eliminating all of the Terrorists. It is won by Terrorists by planting the bomb and it exploding, or by eliminating the Counter Terrorists. Each round win lends more money than a round loss however increasing streaks of round losses lends itself more money. HOWEVER if the Counter Terrorists (Or CTs) run down the clock and win the round, the terrorists will not earn any money for that round lost. Money is also earned by planting and defusing the bomb and for getting kills, with a knife kill yielding the most of $1500 (on the enemy team of course). A teamkill however leads to a loss of money which can be a pain in the  unless you're a baller with $16k. Hostage Largely the same game mechanics as the previous game mode so I won't go back through it all but with an extreme role reversal, with CTs playing an offensive role and Terrorists (CT) playing a defensive role. The CTs objective is to get the hostages back to their spawn point while the TTs have to defend and either run down the clock or eliminate the CTs. Sounds The weapon sounds aren't accurate in the slightest but do however sound pleasing and distinctive which can help in competitive play. Sneaky beaky like... The first time I heard that I lolled<--Nuff said... Miscellaneous Skins Skins are dropped randomly after every game. These are for the majority,  'common' 0.03 skins and I even find that they often look worse than the default colours. You can also get skins from cases but most aren't very good and are worth a whole lot of  compared to the ~$2 you payed for the , motherf****** key. Some skins do look real nice though and I've heard also give extra damage bonuses and s***. ;) Skill levels As of the new update, a ranking system was implemented. You get xp for your games which increases your level. Each new rank for each new week will grant you a skin. Mind you, they are all  unless you have the new pass. Ranks So... No one actually knows how this mysterious system works but that it's based on an ELO system. Each win supposedly increases your ELO while a loss decreases it. Number of MVPs also supposedly increases it. This is factored into matchmaking but is abused by the Smurfs that plague the game. Overall A word of warning... This game isn't fun... It's repetitive, boring, really fustrating but  f****** addictive... If you're looking for a game that's fun I'd suggest COD but it doesn't have the same... 'feel' as CS and not near enough rewarding when you get a kill. Overall I'd give it a solid 9/10 just down to the fact that some of the community isn't the nicest at the best of times...
SNiPY;-;Nice graphics, new maps, weapons and models. But developers should listen to the customers a bit more. Developers you are focused too much on things that are not important at all. You should focus on changing the tick rate of the match making servers to 128 and improving VAC a lot. Those two are what customers really want and you should focus on. Not stickers, UI and HUD changes or skins. And stop messing around with the weapons.

sethiro.;-;The mechanics in this game are off for the most part: Movement is imprecise, tagging is almost not existing, weapons are way too accurate when moving, weapon balancing is bad (P250 + 5/7 are OP, P90), timings in matchmaking are wrong, matchmaking servers are REALLY bad, hitreg is bad even on a decent server (crouching + jumping - check youtube) and in general this game is designed for casuals while it claims to be a competitive title. CS:GO is no match for previous iterations of CS. Sadly.
noscopewagon;-;I shot a guy using Negev Minigun in close range. He survived. He shot me once from Pistol. I died. This game is just A+
Nickarg;-;The ultimate tactical competitive FPS experience: It's Counter Strike! What else?
RaptoR;-;Great true Counter-Strike-like competitive feeling in this latest addition to CS games. It has most of the elements from the older CS games (1.6 and Source) but with updated visuals, weapon skins and stickers, matchmaking system and a goal to unite the two different Counter-Strike communitites: CS1.6 and CSS. This game does that pretty well having a lot of the good old content but still a lot of new stuff to discover. + + Easy to use Matchmaking system. + Updated content (some new weapons that were not in CS1.6 or CSS and new versions of all the classic maps) + Overwatch is a great way to get the community involved in banning cheaters but it's not perfect system (not at all) A lot of important information about the match is not available for overwatchers and in order to get ow you need to win 150 matchmaking games and have a rank at atleast Gold Nova 1. Players on that level are usually not good enough to judge is someone is cheating or not and some more suspicious cases may get more votes on "Evidence beyond reasonable doubt" even when no cheating is involved. + Skins and stickers. These things keep a lot more casual players playing the game and gives the more competitive ones new and exiting content in the game after playing the game for thousands of hours. + Operations that make people play the new maps and all the available official gamemodes makes the game to have more content (operations are usually pretty cheap ~5 containing usually 5 or more maps that can be played on Valves official servers and some kind of scoreboard that keeps track of your matchmaking stats like kills, headshot % and matches won) + Big professional tournamets mainly funded by the community. You buy a certain key to open a weapon case (Esport key in this case is the one that supports electronic sports) and a portion of the money goes towards these tournamets. These big events gather a lot of Counter-Strike people together watching the games and having some great entertainment. When the professional scene does well the game itself attracts more people playing it. + Game gets updated really often compared to many other multiplayer shooters. Sometimes there can be updates every week some of them being quite major. Valve even listens to the community sometimes to make the game even better and more enjoyable. (Obviously they want to hear what the pros have to say about the current state of the game) - - Lots of hackers playing in the higher rankings in matchmaking. As Valve killed boosting in its known form most cheaters are just the one who want get to those highest ranks. Still some boosting appears to be seen even tho it doesn't work like that anymore. - Matchmaking system is quite broken. Rankings don't show the true skill and ability to play as a team but it still serves the purpose. MM being 64 tick is the main problem or atleast thats what the community says when it comes to the system itself. Most players would still pick hackers over low tickrate if it was about matchmaking as whole. The problem around this is that to be able to get any advantage of 128 tick your game needs to run at atleast that 128 fps (not exatly but close to it) and according to Valve greatly over half of the players have an average fps of 30 or less. Thats not enough to get any advantage of high tickrate servers. Another proble with matchmaking is that sometimes it puts higher ranks against lower ones which is not equal at all and usually results in a slaughter of either side. Balance just sometimes isn't there. - Bad behaviour among many players makes some matchmaking games really feel like you'd like to punch somebody. People that refuse to use teamwork or communicate are even worse than bad behaving ones when you want/need to win games. - Valve has a weird way of updating something (like buffing a weapon) without any testing if it will actually work like it was supposed to. This has lead to CZ-75, AUG buff, the insane Tec-9 buff and a lot more weird but sometimes even funny updates. Still a little bit of testing on the field wouldn't hurt anyone. All in all I would totally recommend this game for everyone! Even if it may seem difficult at first you can only get better by learning and playing. For me it has been quite 4.5/5 experience so far so if you have the will give it a go!
Foe;-;If you haven't already played a Counter Strike game then you're doing something wrong. Global Offensive is just like the rest, simply improved as time progresses. Best part of the Counter Strike series is that you know exactly what to expect from each new installment.
M'aiq;-;Ugh...
Cam;-;If you want a game to make you want to kill yourself, this is the game then good sir! Never have I been so dumbfounded by idiots who dont know how to play the game. PEOPLE JUST RDM ME FOR NO REASON, AND HALF THE TIME I'M A T, IT'S RIDICULOUS. I also think there is a glitch, because everytime I spawn it doesnt say innocent nor traitor in the bottom right. Whenever I get on this game I am constantly reminded of how bad I suck, and how awful people are for RDM. This game makes me cry everytime, yet I can't stay away from it, kinda like my ex-girlfriend. If I had to rate it, it would be 14 ripe bananas out of 18
An Baget;-;Best 3rd person RPG game I've ever played, would rate it 11/10 if possible.
BumFreeze;-;This is a very fun experience, and you can harvest money from fanboys who buy skins - I've earnt my money back 3x from when I bought it. Gameplay-wise, it is fun and it keeps me playing it but many of the systems could be a lot better. I love the tactical side of the game, and keeping it small scale makes it work extremely well, the use of flashbangs and rotating round the map, gathering info on the enemy weapons and locations to help your team. However the 64-tick servers mean on my screen, someone bleeds all over the wall because they took 3000000 shots from me, then when I die, apparently I did 0 shots. The recoil is also a bit exaggerated and not as good as in Counter Strike: Source. The ranking system claims to be ELO-based but seems to just be: "Get a win-streak of 6 and you'll rank up" not at all based on your own performance or the enemy ranks In Source, your body would be jolted by the recoil and so your view would be shaken, but your bullets still went wherever your gun pointed. In CSGO, you keep firing and your gun stays in the same position, but your bullets decide to bugger off to the moon, randomly levitating from the gun's barrel. Overall, extremely fun gameplay, but mechanics can be dodgy and faulty.
Limp Bizkit [No More Skins];-;You finally arrive in a deserted place ridden with crime and corruption, No civilians in sight. The sun hurts your eyes and you feel disorientated and wheezy. Its been a long trip, you're tired. You need your rest, you have to be up early in the morning for your first mission. After a restless night you get up and already miss your wife and kids, that could have been the last time you ever saw them. Kiss the photo with your kid on it, don't tear up in front of all the other soldiers. It'll be okay, your loving kid gave you a picture before you left, look at it and smile, keep it in pocket for good luck. Mission is starting soon. You're all geared out and ready to dispatch. Mission starts and your legs are shaking. It'll be okay, it'll be okay. You and your comrade are instructed to flank them, already hearing gunshots and screams elsewhere, sweat dripping off your nose. You teammate goes round the corner, you hear him scream and he gets sprayed down, his body falls over, his eyes wide open, you're stunned and unable to move, his unemotional face staring blankly at you. Your team aren't talking to you, they must have gone. You have no choice but to push forward. Dreading walking around that corner, don't know how many people are behind it. You finally push round the corner and... ING AWPED, THIS GAME IS SO ! >Limp Bizkit has abandoned the match and received a 24 hour competitive matchmaking cooldown.

BLT CSGO-RAFFLE.COM;-;Best Game I have Ever Played! And yes I have played that many hours don't judge me :~:. I just love how this game is designed from it's looks to its sounds, I have never heard any sounds like this having alot of bass in them. Sound is your best friend unless you want to get shot in the back of the head with an AK-47. And yet I thought this game couldn't get any better but Valve is still putting out updates for it including skins for your weapons to add that little extra dazzle to them while you deal some heavy damage to those damn terrorists. It also includes a competitive mode and ranking system if you ever want to play a serious game, but beware, most of these people in competitives aren't very nice no matter what you do, however, you may run into a few polite ones along your journey. And even better! When you shoot a chicken they EXPLODE. They also like to dress up into ghosts and reindeers in holiday events! If you ever have a spare $15 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PICK UP THIS GAME! Plus you can get some extra money from selling those skins for a few dollars ;D. Now please hurry the frick up and BUY THIS GAME 20/10! (Edited paragraphs after dashed line) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well now i'm back to this review and oh god can I even begin to tell you how many updates they have put out since I have posted this? They now have a workshop in which you can make you're own camo's/skins to be picked by Valve to be put into this awesome masterpiece (Although, it is a bit complicating). This game is probably the most realistic game out there (next to Insurgency). It's nothing like ing COD where all you have is 10 year old trollers. You actually find people who are willing to help out AS A TEAM. Now I know i'm rambling, but stick with me, i'm gonna put pro's and cons in. Pros:- Quite realistic Can make some extra money Long lasting gameplay Competitive gamemode (ranked) Demolition An awesome arrange of guns Constantly gets updated. Cons:- People aren't always the nicest. Griefers. Well I think that is all I can add to this review apart that it is ic. Pick it up now.

Thank you so much that you KILLED my favourite game again, because of your 2 eur price, I can't play another 2-3 months, CHEATERS everywhere, and they simply DONT CARE, because its cheaper then their ing cheat. How about making this game Free2Play, and CHEATERS vs CHEATERS. If you care about the game, don't play it for a long time, you will only get RAGE not fair play.  2EUR!  IT HARD!
HooWoo^;-;Yes. There was this one game I fondly remember where our team was down 14-1 at the half. I discarded my attire to let my testicles breathe and my pen1s immediately started getting more and more erect, ultimately reaching a phallic state and with each kill 0rgasmic pulsations would run throughout my whole body. I caressed the head of my pen1s and I ejaculated onto my keyboard, looking up to the screen to see that our team, had actually won.
Silence The Hypocritapottamus;-;First off : I am glad to say that it is nice that Valve gave me something that I can love and waste more time on than someone who loves making molasses, I still can't help feeling: HL3 ??? SHORT VERSION : Great, gameplay is great. Matchmaking is okayish? The weapon skins are also a nice touch but creates a gambling styled addiction among some players to get and open more and more cases. Hackers exist but few and far between generally. Worth astrnomical value on sale even for -33% or -20%. Frankly, it's price is perfect. You don't have to grasp your head around everything at once but it is fun all the same. With the obvious outta the way, this game is great. I can't possibly hate on it when I fail at it and I can't possibly not dance around in joy when I win. It's a fun action FPS once you practice well enough but beyond that is it very tactical. I love how you cannot aim down iron sights in this game seeing as every other game has used that as an excuse for you having such big wavy arm muscles you HAVE to be as accurate as the death star's laser when firing 300 rounds per minute. Instead it forces you to adapt and learn to fire a gun accurately to the point where you can fire the M4 or AK47 30 rounds per clip without spraying once and instead firing each shot individually but more importantly accurately. The gameplay is superb in this way. The game mode's are great but nothing particullarly rivals the Competitive mode which has you challenged so well that it adds to the fun. Arms Race is a great way to practice for beginners and I played it so much having very little time in the day (only a half hour or hour) and being unable to play Competitive that I can easily get to atleast 20 kills in a match of Arms Race or even win within 3 matches (often being the first however). Ever since then I got alot more free time that I had the liberty of playing competitive again! Matches have a nice 2 minute system where after that the defending team wins. Hurray, I can now kill usually between 15-20 people in a match on a good day. I think my record was something like 36 or 34. Good times... Valve really put alot of care into this because they always do. They play tested the crap out of and you can tell this in any Valve game be it Left 4 Dead, Half Life or Team Fortress 2. (Oddly enough, all of those sequels end on 2...) And though this might be the 4th or something, maybe 5th Counter Strike game beginning with the mod, going 1.6, CS Condition Zero/Deleted Scenes, CS Source and Counter Strike Global Offensive it only feels to have gotten much, much better over time. This apparently united the rival forces of 1.6 players and CSS players into one happy community. Hey, I can't argue that Valve put time into this and to speak of it's price tag DURING a sale like Summer or Christmas is astronomical in value. I bought it for 3.50, didn't play it on my old PC since it was crap and couldn't run it, didn't like it at first and kept with GMOD but eventually my friends forced me to get into it. It's use of rounds as opposed to RUN AND GUN mechanics is great. It forces the player to learn the enemy to win if challenged and also to learn themselves to play better and allows the player to be brought up into the game easier. At first the game may seem daunting and frustrating but past that is spectacullarly great. People new to the franchise tend to begin without thought, run and gun that sorta thing however over time you begin to learn to think tactically. I recommend the use of Flashbang and Smoke Grenades as soon as possible as it will save your life. Literally. The game rewards skill and intelligence and unlike other FPSes where the biggest, scariest and most famous gun wins, this has the holy grail of gameplay's as the only thing that matters is skill. And luck, but you can't control that so leave it be! However, there are some issues I have with the game. I have the problem of hackers occuring on lower ranked matches with my friends. I don't understand why anyone would cheat but in this game, where you get the glory of winning by being the smartest I really can't wrap my mind around it. The matchmaking is generally good though. You are put into ranks according to your skill after 10 matches. This allows fair and equal matchmaking generally. You will get into the odd circumstance where you play against very high ranking players like Gold Nova 2's and so on but this isn't ever a problem because with your brain you can find way's around them and how to win. Maps have the issue of being favourable to one team but once you are skilled enough, it means nothing but most people tend to play on maps that are familiar and work for them. I prefer nuke and dust and it is a shame that I just can't enjoy every map equally. Openning cases can create a gambling like addiction in rare cases but I do love how it affects : Nothing, it just maps your crappy looking HD M4A4 into something cool. Stattrak is also pretty nice but I do not like how it is built to give you something crap before something good. Still, I like how everything can we sold on the marketplace for money to put to MORE STEAM GAMES, can't argue. All in all, this game is more fun than a dolphin dancing around a dragon statue worshipping its new fake god. If I had to rate it, i'd say 9/10 for the lack of good maps like Dust II and occassional hackers but everything else is perfect. I recommend buying this game all the way. DO NOT HESITATE!

I'll Split the contents or fetures into Good, Moderate, Bad and Terrible. Letting you guys know this is MY Review it's MY opinion of the game. I will give a final score like 5/10 ( 5 Out of Ten ) Or something like that. Good Content Ok Lets Start Off with the good stuff in CS:GO -Runs on nearly all PCs ( Not to Brag but I have an i7 3610QM, Nvidia GT 630M and 16 GB of Ram And it runs on lowest with 100-300 FPS ) -Smooth Feeling The Movement feels really nice and smooth I really enjoy the game movement. -Guns are balanced ( Well..... now they are... ) I think the guns are VERY balanced they all have their weakness and strength, Like the AWP Yes it's a VERY powerful weapon ( One Hit Kill to the Body up ) But the AWPER can be easily taken down by smoking and rushing with a rifle or the best thing to rush with a shotgun or SMG. -Never Gets old for me This Game I'v been playing since it's release ( 2012 ) And my hours on it might be crazy for some people, Like how could you play one game so much?. I Really enjoy this game It NEVER gets boring for me because you'll never be the BEST of the BEST but you can always try and try to get better Right now as this review I'm sitting on Nova 4 what is kinda bad for having 1.5k hours but I play for fun not to have the best world rank ( Global Elite ). Reason this Game never gets boring I think would be because of the updates ( New Update maybe every 4 weeks or less sometimes ) Moderate Content Ok All games has some moderate stuff -Ranking system Ok I WAS Going to put this in the Good but.... It has too many issues, sometimes if your a Silver 4 you vs Nova 2s what is unfair and you lose the game and then also smurfs.... Some people say these people are issues I don't think it's much of an issue, If anything you can learn from these people. -Able to make money from skins ( Locked In Steam ) This also Should be in good but I have some issues with it... First I have people joining the server saying 'Trading AK-47 Red Line' in a Match Making Match.... This is a competitive game not a casual game like TF2.. But then also you can get other games you want for free by selling / trading skins or crates. Bad Content -64 Tick Servers People always complain about this in CS:GO but never has been fixed, Well At least not yet.... Anyway some server do have 128 Tick ( Not Valve Ones ). I have had issues with 64 Tick servers, Like I shoot someone with an AWP on the Body then they just stand there looking at me then shoot I die they do not. -The Community... Hard where to start.. The CS:GO Community is full of rude, hackers, scammers or account hackers. *Scammers - This Issue only came when trading was added. *Hackers - This is a big issue for what some people say BUT I have NEVER encounter a hacker on a match making match only on one community server. *Account Hackers Ok this is a HUGE issue and again only came along from trading, People will add you saying 'I Want to trade for your knife for my M9 Bayonet Fade add me on my main account here *Fake Scam Link*' NEVER click this link! If you log in your account will go bye, Bye... just block these guys report them and remove. BUT there are other account hacking ways like the photo scam where they send you a link saying WTF *Photo Link* and when you click it, it downloads a virus without your permission and takes your CS:GO items. I'v had this happen to ONE of my freinds then he send me a message with the scam link because the virus also sends out a scam link to ALL your freinds don't trust any links from ANYONE!. *Rude People Of corse EVERY game has the mean people in the community it's normal for that but it seems CS:GO has grown a bigger one then most other games.. If your a new player to CS:GO I recommend playing with a freind in Match Making as people WILL kick you if you are bad at the game only way to stop if you have someone to vote 'no' or if someone votes 'no' but they can always revote to kick you off again and again and keep trying till the last guy accepts. Hope This review helped you guys! Thank you guys for reading my review! Review By -Goldenhawk

Vanna;-;Why-don't-my-bullets-go-where-I-want-them-to Simulator 2012
Deven |aFK|;-;Super Duper Game, All counter strike lovers must have this game in there collection :)))) its difficult first but later when u get use to it is thrilling, awesome, game. Give it a try you will not regret your choice.
TOX!C;-;Great classic fps, its by far worth the money
alexjaz;-;Nice weapon sometimes I kill peaople, my friend kevin kills me sometime, but its ok because he is my friend :)
The Freeman;-;Almost as good as Call of Duty, the game it so clearly copied.
francisko;-;this game.  lag.  matchmaking with 64 tickrate servers.  buggy hitboxes.  one way smokes.  one way corners. What was that honey? I bet 0,10 weapons and won a StatTrak AWP? I LOVE THIS GAME.
Kelso;-;Gameplay: This game much like, but also more so than the other Counter-Strike series is very competitive and even has its own game mode for such a style of gameplay. It's noticeably more competitive due to its live streams on Twitch and hosted events, this means that this games requires you to be more aware of your surroundings, being a better team player and good team leader. At times it requires to be a lone wolf and get new common self-awards such as a 'clutch' or an 'ace' AKA finishing off the opposing team as the last man standing. Compared to games like Call of Duty which I consider very fast paced, this game takes things slow and even with a 2 minute time limit you are required to take precautions before moving in. Graphics: Although I'm not bothered about graphics and doesn't really play a major factor in my decisions of getting games, these graphics have definitely improved from the previous Valve engine and still have that Counter-Strike feel. Some maps of course are imported from previous Counter-Strike games, and therefore have that similar but still fresh look, however the new maps have a definite sense of improvement and renewed style. Controls & Movement: The controls to this game are exactly the same to the other Counter-Strike series and therefore has it's playability output increased however, for those new to the game and have played previous game such as Call of Duty and Battlefield etc, getting used to this may prove difficult to some. The controls to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are quite simple but getting used to the way the mechanics move may take a small amount of time. That's the good thing about Counter-Strike though, it's a reasonably easy game to get into but difficult to master, although with help from community workshop maps that help improve accuracy, you'll be able to have a small advantage. Conclusion: Overall this game is fantastic, bringing a classic FPS to a new generation of games. This games requires skill and isn't all about shooting first and thinking after, especially in competitive situations. Playing with friends is easily still really fun and has a user-friendly interface. Even though there's the addition of buying weapon skins etc, I find that's a bonus to the game if you're really committed. I think that, this is a game where you can endlessly rack countless hours up and be none the wiser. Rating: Gameplay: [9/10] Graphics: [8/10] Controls & Movement: [10/10] Overall: [9/10]

<McMarko>;-;I've played it for few minutes and it looks like a decent game i guess
The Killer Tofu;-;It's worth your time, it's worth your money, it's worth shelving your life for 6 months to learn dem peeks by heart. But are YOU worth it? Seriously, it's the definitive competitive FPS experience and you WILL sink joyful hours into this beast. You'll learn the game in a fortnight, but somehow continue learning for years. The community is mostly friendly and welcomes newcomers, and most will gladly help you out taking the first few steps into each mode of the game and new aspects. If you're one of those guys who puts "family" before gaming, and usually only buys one or two games a year, CSGO will keep you engaged for a long, long time. /family not included./

woodzie;-;It will consume your life.
Promexus;-;Sometimes you would just rather play with a team of chickens than a team of silver 1s. At least the chickens won't flashbang you. Plus you never have to buy for a chicken, so you can save all your money to buy auto snipers every time. If you get hungry, you can cook them with a molotov and eat them (the silver 1s might complain if you do that, in chat of course because mics are overrated). Best of all, roosters don't have . I'm not sure how that last point was relevant, but I felt like it had to be said. I would rate this game 10 out of 10, but stick to casual if you want to keep your sanity intact. Also avoid spending $200 on a painted knife in a video game. Trust me, it's for the best.
Faze Dylan Roof;-;Welcome to CS:GO where the ranks are made up and your wins don't matter!
tdoytchev;-;One of the best games of all time. So much achievments,servers,and ranks. Sometimes there's a cheater but hopefully VAC will catch them. There are a multitude of skins,voices,and maps to choose from. Skill is involved. Severs include: Deathmatch,Arms Race,Zombies,Bunny Hop servers and more! You will have a blast playing with friends. Heck even solo is fun! CS:GO honestly,is living up the Counter-Strike legacy. Get this game while it's on sale or full price. Worth it either way!
CONVERSE (Overheat.ro);-;It's Counter Strike, everyone love it :D

Subject: O.G.I.;-;Welcome to Couter Strike: Russian Warfare A FPS game where some weapons can kill in one shot, while others can do it in 15. Where you run faster with a knife then a weapon, even when you have that weapon on your back. Where T's can purchase helmets which can fit under their skins, while if CT's dont they get cardboard replicas. Where elite counter-terrorist squads need to buy their weapons (persumably cause their goverment is a )... Play realistic scenarios where Terrorist dont carry more than one bomb, to blow up a bunch of boxes, and CT's only need to save one hostage... the rest. Play on a large variaty of maps (de_dust2,de_nuke,de_inferno), and use realistic weaponry that has camos whitch can fit in a amusment park enviroment. Ever wanted to learn russian?

Starting off is  ing facing dudes that have like 4k playing time and spent like ing thousands on the game and talk all this  on the mic when they can barely speak english.

BaTTi;-;Good day! Valve gave us CS 1.6, made the continuation of the game called "CS: GO" in 2012. CS: GO quality game, great physics, good gameplay make this game one of the best games in the section of shooters. The game has an abundant variety of skins for weapons, plus all this, that the players themselves can spread the skins, and if they get to the top, they can appear in the trace. updating in the box. Copious amounts of cards, almost all of which moved from 1.6 with beautiful graphics. The game will cost you in the moment, 450 p, but I assure you you'll be happy with what you get. Apparently speak out, I put the game 9/10. But the game is suitable only for those who know how to shoot. :) Thank you, and good luck with your game!
Gotgo;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Review & Regret Pros: You acquire pennies in the form of random drops!  You get to be mad... with friends!  You become culturally enriched!  You recognize your online breaking point!  You learn teamwork... off of the other team! Cons: Better connection means better player.  Luck is a big factor for a low/mid skilled player.  Hit detection; 60% of the time it works every time  Hacking happens more than people admit less than people assume  More smurfs than Gargamel knows what to do with Conclusion: All in all it's a fun game and even more so with friends. The worst part of it being the community to which there is no real escape. If it isn't a person trolling or being a pain in your retinas it's a person who is light years ahead of you in skill, but has a fresh account waiting to ruin your experience. The skill gap is more of a chasm leaving for a compilation of infuriating gameplay and a mountain of progression you can find yourself climbing up or falling down. The online play is more connection warfare than any other FPS I've played meaning players with a bad connection have a strong probability of being held back severely. The dedicated servers provided don't help the cause either; numerous professional players and full time CSGO streamers claim the hit detection simply doesn't cut it. Even through all this there is good. By far the best part about this game is the enjoyment you get out of playing it with a few other friends. You can share your victories, your laughs, your tactics, and yes your anger with people you know and people you enjoy. So even if you aren't enjoying the match you are still enjoying something. Recommendation: If you enjoy First Person Shooters and haven't picked this up yet there is no reason not to give it a try. It's one of the most popular and populated FPS on the market today and will continue to dominate in that respect. Whether you should continue to play after you have tried it is completely up to you. This game has a way of killing the fish it hooks.
TFH;-;This game is the best fps game ever! First i though its all about the moneyh but later on we got married and we named our babies M4A4 Xray and AK47 Cartel and the little cute baby Ups-S Guardian, they look so factory new! Buy cs go and loose a wife!! 69/69 Its still the best game!

Banana AKA Bunny;-;I used to be a player of this game like you, Then I got 4 Russians in my team. 11/10 WOULD   your competitve match again. But otherwise - the game itself is pretty good and competitve mod motivates you to play more and more. However if you have a weak heart, I DO NOT RECCOMEND to play this game cometitively then.

350Z | Austinomical;-;Full of cheaters/derankers/smurfs. TRUST me...DO NOT buy this game. It's a good game, possibly the best FPS ever made, but it is broken by a toxic community I am afraid.
ZoXy`;-;Game is very fun and good, but i not recommend to buy this game because very very much people is hacking in this game, especially in matchmaking(MM). Dont buy it until valve not fix this massive cheaters problem. Peace.

Catovneg;-;try nice game )
ir. Goki;-;This game can seem fairly daunting when you first play it, especially with the type of gunplay involved, but, once you get the handle of the guns and recoil this is a super fun game that can be enjoyed by yourself or on you own. 9/10
HalfSquirrel;-;If you don't feel like reading, full recommendation in the last paragraph. First things first: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is EXTREMELY addictive. You might disagree, but that's probably because you're one of those people that just wants to try and be unique so you hate the game because you want to hate it rather than because it's actually bad. If you're playing this game to have a good time, good times will be had. With a bunch of different gamemodes to choose from, there is always something for you to do, whether you're looking for a fun way to spend a few minutes before leaving or if you're looking for an intense match against other players. The game itself is unique. In the main gametype (competitive), the Terrorists and the Counter Terrorists, face off to see who will come out on top. The terrorists have to plant the bomb in one of the sites, and the counter terrorists have to try to prevent that. If it happens, then they have to try and defuse the bomb in the time given. It takes a lot of time and effort to learn the game, because it involves learning a lot of different maps and the various locations that can be found there, learning how to shoot properly in this game with very unusual shooting patterns, and learning how to work as a team to come out on top. Learning to shoot in this game involves learning how to stop before shooting, not shooting in mid-air and controlling your spray so that as many shots as possible hit the target. All of these involve lots of practice for people new to the Counter Strike series. You also need to work together with your team. You have to make sure to use your money appropriately for the situation, and determine a buying plan with the team. You also need to develop a strategy for which players will go where to get the bomb planted in the site, or how your team is going to defend the site. You need to learn and make callouts and preferably use the voice chat to make sure your team has as much information as possible. You need to remember to buy grenades and remember that they are an important part of the game so its worth spending the money on. Then you need to learn how to use these grenades youve got. There is a lot to consider when playing CS:GO, and its an enjoyable experience to learn what to do in what situations. Communication is a really fun and important thing to have in this game. From callouts of enemy players, to casual conversations about Madagascar, communication is everything in CS:GO. Your teammates will depend on you, and you will depend on them and thats what makes playing this game so fun. You have to be able to trust your teammates to give you the right information, but you also have to know that no intel is 100%. Its also important that there is no dislike on the team, which you cant always control because you might end up playing with some of the most annoying people in existence, but if you dislike someone or someone dislikes you, they wont be playing their best and they might not even be playing at all. However, the matchmaking and ranking systems in CS:GO are not very good. In your average competitive game where youre playing alone, you will often notice that youre either with some of the dumbest people on the planet or (rarely) that your team consists of some pretty cool people that you might want to play with again. Smurfs (people that buy new accounts to play with people below their rank) are very common, so its not rare that youll get placed in a game with a player that is supposedly far below your rank and playing like a top player. The system for dealing with hackers is still a pain even with recent updates that improved it, because if you get put against a hacker youre expected to have to deal with playing the entire 45 minute game, even if you dont have to deal with the result of the game when the hacker gets banned. Also, there is a chance youll get put against extremely high ranked players if they queued with someone of a low rank. On a similar topic, you cant surrender when your team is obviously being wrecked and there is no chance of success unless someone on your team abandons. I think its really annoying to have to play through 45 minute games, even though it tells you at the beginning youre committing to it, if no one is enjoying the game. Its a pain, and really just not worth the effort. The ranking up/down system is extremely painful. You never know how close you are to ranking up, and its determined solely by whether you win or lose (as far as I know). It doesnt take into account individual skill (this is extremely important in matchmaking, since you could get put in a team with awful players and lose because of that), and I dont think it takes into account how much your team wins by or the rank difference between the players. The rankings are still generally a good representation of a players skill (except for the players starting rank, but thats not that big of a deal anyways), but I believe its still too vague and has a lack of depth. A big issue, though it would be a hard one to solve, is community support. When you get banned from competitive because you timed out and couldnt get back in time, or due to something out of your control unless you want to spend tons of money on it, there is nothing to help you get back in. Although its always a temporary ban, it can still be a pain to have to wait it out. Its pretty unfair at times. Although its good that the community is involved and gets to contribute to the game in the form of weapon skins and maps, its just not enough to have a good, strong community. Another thing I really dont like about CS:GO is its community. Of course there are a lot of good people that are extremely helpful, but some people just want to  you off. I made a thread about the above issue at some point, and there were too many people telling me if you cant get back to the game in 3 minutes, you should spend an unreasonably large amount of money upgrading your PC and router. Its even worse in game. There are constantly trolls that dont even try, annoying players that will be abusive in the chats (although you can block that, its still an issue in the community) and smurfs and hackers that shouldnt exist. A really big issue for me is bots. In competitive matches, a full team is essential and having a player that cant do anything, and wont even listen to the ingame commands that control them half the time, is extremely harmful. Sometimes you cant control when someone has to leave or times out and things like that, and not having a lot of control over how that 5th player does things can easily cause the loss of rounds. Its one of the worst things in the game to be playing at a disadvantage, because having an advantage over the other team is everything in CS:GO competitive. You also have no decent way of getting rid of them, because if you hurt them, you get banned as much as you would for killing an actual person. Overall, I think the game can easily be worth $15. Though it does have some flaws, most of them arent really gameplay related and I would easily recommend this extremely fun and addicting game. Id still suggest getting it while its on sale, because then of course its cheaper and theyre pretty common so you wont have to wait long, but if youre really excited to play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, then I wouldnt be against buying the game at its original price. Congratulations if you read through this entire review, and I hope it helped in your decision on whether or not to buy this game!

All of these involve lots of practice for people new to the Counter Strike series. You also need to work together with your team. You have to make sure to use your money appropriately for the situation, and determine a buying plan with the team. You also need to develop a strategy for which players will go where to get the bomb planted in the site, or how your team is going to defend the site. You need to learn and make callouts and preferably use the voice chat to make sure your team has as much information as possible. You need to remember to buy grenades and remember that they are an important part of the game so its worth spending the money on. Then you need to learn how to use these grenades youve got. There is a lot to consider when playing CS:GO, and its an enjoyable experience to learn what to do in what situations. Communication is a really fun and important thing to have in this game. From callouts of enemy players, to casual conversations about Madagascar, communication is everything in CS:GO. Your teammates will depend on you, and you will depend on them and thats what makes playing this game so fun. You have to be able to trust your teammates to give you the right information, but you also have to know that no intel is 100%. Its also important that there is no dislike on the team, which you cant always control because you might end up playing with some of the most annoying people in existence, but if you dislike someone or someone dislikes you, they wont be playing their best and they might not even be playing at all. However, the matchmaking and ranking systems in CS:GO are not very good. In your average competitive game where youre playing alone, you will often notice that youre either with some of the dumbest people on the planet or (rarely) that your team consists of some pretty cool people that you might want to play with again. Smurfs (people that buy new accounts to play with people below their rank) are very common, so its not rare that youll get placed in a game with a player that is supposedly far below your rank and playing like a top player. The system for dealing with hackers is still a pain even with recent updates that improved it, because if you get put against a hacker youre expected to have to deal with playing the entire 45 minute game, even if you dont have to deal with the result of the game when the hacker gets banned. Also, there is a chance youll get put against extremely high ranked players if they queued with someone of a low rank. On a similar topic, you cant surrender when your team is obviously being wrecked and there is no chance of success unless someone on your team abandons. I think its really annoying to have to play through 45 minute games, even though it tells you at the beginning youre committing to it, if no one is enjoying the game. Its a pain, and really just not worth the effort. The ranking up/down system is extremely painful. You never know how close you are to ranking up, and its determined solely by whether you win or lose (as far as I know). It doesnt take into account individual skill (this is extremely important in matchmaking, since you could get put in a team with awful players and lose because of that), and I dont think it takes into account how much your team wins by or the rank difference between the players. The rankings are still generally a good representation of a players skill (except for the players starting rank, but thats not that big of a deal anyways), but I believe its still too vague and has a lack of depth. A big issue, though it would be a hard one to solve, is community support. When you get banned from competitive because you timed out and couldnt get back in time, or due to something out of your control unless you want to spend tons of money on it, there is nothing to help you get back in. Although its always a temporary ban, it can still be a pain to have to wait it out. Its pretty unfair at times. Although its good that the community is involved and gets to contribute to the game in the form of weapon skins and maps, its just not enough to have a good, strong community. Another thing I really dont like about CS:GO is its community. Of course there are a lot of good people that are extremely helpful, but some people just want to  you off. I made a thread about the above issue at some point, and there were too many people telling me if you cant get back to the game in 3 minutes, you should spend an unreasonably large amount of money upgrading your PC and router. Its even worse in game. There are constantly trolls that dont even try, annoying players that will be abusive in the chats (although you can block that, its still an issue in the community) and smurfs and hackers that shouldnt exist. A really big issue for me is bots. In competitive matches, a full team is essential and having a player that cant do anything, and wont even listen to the ingame commands that control them half the time, is extremely harmful. Sometimes you cant control when someone has to leave or times out and things like that, and not having a lot of control over how that 5th player does things can easily cause the loss of rounds. Its one of the worst things in the game to be playing at a disadvantage, because having an advantage over the other team is everything in CS:GO competitive. You also have no decent way of getting rid of them, because if you hurt them, you get banned as much as you would for killing an actual person. Overall, I think the game can easily be worth $15. Though it does have some flaws, most of them arent really gameplay related and I would easily recommend this extremely fun and addicting game. Id still suggest getting it while its on sale, because then of course its cheaper and theyre pretty common so you wont have to wait long, but if youre really excited to play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, then I wouldnt be against buying the game at its original price. Congratulations if you read through this entire review, and I hope it helped in your decision on whether or not to buy this game!

Pingypoker;-;wow um why cant you aim down sights
starcalleR;-;PROS; #1- I can easily say that the competition on matchmaking, the ranking system -which is only available on CS:GO- made this game is the best of the serie. #2- Weapon skins and the stickers for sure! They're making the game much more better! #3- The "Operation" events! They're selling access for these events and making so many maps and some bonus case drops whoever joins the operation events, and they're fun! - I think there're like 3 events already finished and one is still alive! CONS; #1- CHEATS! I really can't imagine how Valve can't stand against all these cheaters.. There are so many cheaters in this game like in every other FPS game. #2- BAD SERVERS! Not usually, but sometimes you lag too much, even disconnect because of bad servers. -CONS UPDATE FOR 64 TICK SERVERS! -VALVE NEEDS TO UPGRADE IT'S SERVERS TO 128TICK!
~Lewy~;-;I don't really like this game but mostly because of my preference/opinions, CS:GO isn't really a casual game but more focused to competitive people who have GB/sec internet and can run games smoothly and use every trick in the book to use against you. However from other people's experience that I have talked to, public competitive matches is not the way to go due to the different types of players it matches you up with. For example you have a "smurf" which is a high ranking competitive player using an alt or some other way to change his/her rank so its low....that way they get pitted against new players for target practice. Also a large majority of people on Steam get VAC banned due to abusing hacks in CS:GO, even top of the line players can be using some form of hack. This review only scratches the surface of it but needless to say a lot of people may not like this game as I have, not to say its bad...its just not something I cant mess about on to enjoy without the seriousness like the filthy casual I am. :3
NOKIA SE;-;Quoted the "OK! Let's Go!" prolog that started every single round that all shooter fans from the 90s are familiar with. CS:GO is the latest edition to the one of the most well known and played shooter game through out the history of the world - the Counter-Strike franchise. And just like the Counter-Strike back then more than a decade ago was never about fancy features, stunning graphic, or special effects. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is about the good old classic gameplay but revamped, polished and improved such as gameplay balances, animation, interface, presentation, audios and visuals, then powered by the modern systems and technologies to keep this franchise up-tp-date with the flow of time. However, CS:GO is not Counter-Strike 2 or the Counter-Strike: Source that merely replaced the engine and optimized a bit on top of it, but a better, newer and more advanced edition to the series which can shine its veteran brand that was left untouched in the last 13 years. I recommend this game to those newcomers who wonder how the shooter game back then was played and interested to give it a try as well as a definite must buy to the old players who have been playing shooters before the terms like "ADS, or Aiming Down the Sight, which also known as Iron Sighting" was invented. Q1: What can I expect as a player who never played a shooter without aiming simulation before? A1: You'll notice dropping an opponent is no longer as simple as counting one to two, meaning right click to aim and left click to pull the trigger. You'll also need to hone not only your aiming skills, but also how you fire your weapon, especially the timing in order to synergize the hitting pattern of your weapon on to your target. In simple words, things just got more difficult in a somewhat inhuman way. Q2: What else? A2-1: Counter-Strike has a lot of depths in how you move, how you aim, how you fire your weapon and even how you approach the position you have in mind after a new round started, and that's not the end of it. A2-2: It uses dedlicate server, server browser, and match-making. It focuses in a delicate scale of combat where players will play the game through a 5v5 scale by standard default. Custom scales ranging from 8v8 to 16v16 is supported depending on the actual server-side setting of the server you were connected into. A2-3: Given that there is hardly a cheap easy kill for players, there is no health regen, and it took quite some study and patience to get things started - Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a renewal of a classic way of how players used to play shooter games, a harsh (or perhaps just like I said, inhuman) shooter game by today's standard for average players. Sum: If you neither a old timer or a newcomer who really interested in the old, classic, proven way to play a shooter game, then there won't be any particular reason I should recommend you to get this game with the only exception being you're sicked and tired how easy today's shooter games are like.
Mike;-;Computer based tactical shooter. Extremely high skill if you're willing to put in the effort you will be rewarded. Russian players is a big problem for everyone in the matchmaking... so I'd recommend anyone for ESEA there isn't a lot of them ;) I met a lot of wonderful people in this game (friendship forever: P) 10/10 !
Atrax;-;CS:GO is arguably one of the best first person shooters (FPS) currently available. And short story, it's more then worth for the price. Now long story though, there is a lot more to it. First, if you are new to CS series, before you go for it, prepare to die a lot. In this game, fast reflexes and good aim wins the game, and that is something you get only with time, so be persistent, and more you play it, more fun you will have. On the brighter side, weapons are greatly balanced, unlike any other FPS, so no matter what team you pick, you can be sure that your opponents have no adventage over you in that matter. Now there are several mods, and I strongly recommend not to go into competitive unless you are sure you know what you are doing. Reason for this is because your team will offten expect more then what you can give. That will probably result in some insults via chat messages. Also you may get voted off (kicked) out of the game, that further might result in competitive cooldown. So for first time, you probably want to try so called "Arms Race" mod, where you will get your chance to test most of the weapons, and figure how they respond. Also you can move on to some "Deathmatch" for aim improving and of course some "Classic Casual" and "Community Competitive" before you jump on to real thing. Also be aware, as there is people who simply don't like losing the game. They will always find an excuse, and that may be "poor 64 tick server preformanse", or "having cheaters in opposing team" and as you become good, they will probably accuse you as well. For those kind of people there is no help. Actually when I think about it twice, whoever seem to bother you, you can completely mute him, and continue your super-awesome game. For the actuall cheaters, you may hear there is tons of them, but again, read section above. Unfortunatelly there is some here and there (for what I have played I met only few) but they get sorted out by quite unique system called "Overwatch". For the overwatch I won't go into details, but very good players get to decide who is cheating and who's not. In tons of cases they get false reports, again because of people can't stand a loss! (: Bottom line of the review: Get the game, it's among the best currently available, and you will have tons of fun with it!

HOPES;-;Ok, now that I've almost played 1k hours of CS:GO I made my own picture about this game. At first i really love csgo and I like to play with friends and win with good strategies. At the beginning of csgo i was pretty bad got ranked in silver, but I got better and better now I am at Legendary Eagle and after so many months of playing Csgo so much things have changed. At first valve started to set the keys for cases to an amount that is totally overpayed. For 1 Key u need to pay in Euro 2,29 thats too expensive in my Mind, because what u get out of it is mostly just crap. But the worst in CSgo what pisses me off and let me think to stop playing it are those Hackers. I mean I'm a person who calls very often someone a hacker for no really good reason but if I'm not the only one there must be something going on. In like every third game in Matchmaking that we are playing there is mostly 1 guy who is playing way better than his mates or even his rank-skills. And I even experienced that some people got even a VAC-bann while playing a game. If Valve what do more stuff against the hackers instead of setting the price higher I think more people would even play this game and also those crap 64-tick server are horrable u can't even improve ur skills on those server especially if u played already atleast once or twice on Faceit oder ESEA! All in all CS:GO is a very awesome game and one of my favorits, but some things just have to change!

Revan The Bleeding Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

Magazine;-;Remember to buy Counter-Strike: Global Offensive if you like: - Russians shouting at you with their native language for no apparent reason - you'll learn words like " blyat" in no time! - People trying to votekick you every 5 seconds because you didn't ace - Getting killed by people who say "lol git gud skreb im da best ahahahah ez pz" and once you kill them, they call you a hacker - Opening cases in hopes of a 300  knife, only to discover you've paid 3000  on the keys instead and only gotten blue items - Enduring through a ~60 minute game, where your teammates all waddle off on their own and get killed, flash you, buy a SSG/ask for an AWP to be dropped every round because they claim to be godly snipers and then die to somebody in the next 5 seconds. Oh, and all of this will be your fault. - Being against smurfs with 9001 hours in the game, (higher-level players on another account to play on lower-level games), and getting absolutely destroyed against them because you just started - who then say "ez pz noobs u suk" - Getting banned for 7 days from competitive games because your Internet disconnects often - People who ask to be kicked when you lost the first round - Starting a Competitive game in a non-English-speaking team where 4 other players are a pre-made team, who then votekick you just because they can. Oh, and don't forget getting insulted before they do that - Squeaky kids that have had a relationship with each and everyone's mother. Sometimes it's not just kids, either. - People saying they're Global Elite in a Silver game, who then proceed to bottom-frag, and whose rank shows to be Silver I and whom claim you're hacking because you did better than him - Playing on Dust 2 This game is 8/8, play it to see it in all of its glory.

sWole;-;Ready to play a REAL FPS? This isn't you run of the mill kiddie 360xXNoScopeXxQuickscope dropshot game, your skill doesn't depend on scopes or grips, heartbeat sensors or noob tubes, this game is all about gaining personal skill. Your improvement and developement as a player will depend on your willingness to learn and devote time to learning "strats" to improve your gameplay as a team, or as a solo player. You will practice smokes and flash grenade spots for hours to use in competitive matches, sit in aim maps and perfect your reactions and headshots. Just because someone happens to get a lucky headshot on you, or is steamrolling you in competitive doesn't make them a hacker, they are simply out-playing you, and you need to adapt to that. You will need to be able to read your enemies movements, placement, and gameplay to continue to dominate in competitive, and this all comes with practice and time playing. You're not going to jump into this game playing like a pro, you will start from the bottom just how everyone else has, and work your way up as you develop a better feel for the game as a whole. 10/10 r.i.p. social life
AwesomeSauceGamingTV;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is certainly an interesting game. When I first got into the game I played and was horrible. I then put in a lot of time into this game. I went from Silver 3 when I was first ranked, and now I'm Gold Nova 3. My highest rank was Gold Nova Master. Overall, this game is a quality game. It is frustrating with the ammount of hackers and smurfers. However, I'm learning that it is just a part of the game. Smurfing is understandable, hacking is not. You need to really understand the maps, callouts, smokes and flash spots. When you jump into a competetive game realize that your money is not your money, it is your team's money. If you do not play with that mentality, you have no reason to play competitive. This game is an A- for me overall. It has the most hours for me on steam for a reason. However Valve, please get a better hack detector. I know for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This time however it seems that the reaction is far better than the action. If you come into this game wanting to play something that is exhilerating and competitive, you my friend have come to the right place.
Kaleidescoop;-;It was an ordinary day of solo-queueing, and I had been on the winning team in Workout. We were winning 15-0, and the other team didn't even stand a chance. On the last round, we decided to do a knife only. I turned the corner, noticing a Terrorist come out from the other end. I notice a basketball on the ground, and I hit it. It rolls towards him. He hits it back. A CT joins in, and then a T, and another, until the entire server is playing soccer with the basketball. Ts are winning 3-2. We are all good sports, except for one dude. Xban@TIC64, with 2 kills and 3 assists. He gets frustrated. Yells in teamchat. Then the unthinkable happens. He pulls out a Negev. And holds down the trigger. Instantly, the air is fulled with hundreds of bullets. The Ts dive for cover, but it is too late. They fall one by one, running away with their knives out. The game ends. Counter-Terrorists win. Before the scoreboard comes up and people recieve items, someone on my team starts a votekick to kick Xban@TIC64. It goes through with 4 votes. He is kicked. I have top-scored, with 47 kills and 12 assists. Turning around to get a drink of water, I freeze when I hear the sound of me getting a drop. I turn around slowly, getting ready to face my item. I look at the monitor. I have gotten a Galil | Sage Spray.

Alphanthesis;-;A hard game to fap to. But if you go really fast, it'll work.
Yung Tubesock;-;Ah, Counter Strike. It takes me back to to a hot summer day back in 2011 when i pirated half life one and this came with the bundle. Of course, it was 1.6... Well, needless to say i sucked more at this game than johnathan's mom, but i soon grew accustomed to it and then i came up upon this nifty program called steam. I bought it ( when i still had a cast) and i was disgusted by the difficulty but now i'm writing to you as a silver one and after a year or so, i call it progress. ( Dont insult my skills negur ill smoke you quicker than you got your hand in your ). Well, CS:GO is one of the best games i have ever played and my little "clique" seems to enjoy it too. The gameplay, guns, maps, and whetever else you want to name surpass my expectation. If you get this game, get it for the competitive, not casual. This game is subject to numerous updated for stupid stuff due to valve changing all the  we players complain about. Counter strike is a great way to work on teamwork and it will basiclly change your perception of a true "FPS". The weapons require knowledge on how to use them and they also require you to not be a little whiny girl over them. There are so many people who play and the newcomers understand it quick if they are committed to the game. I give it nine Monica lewenski  out of ten.
A Typical Gamer;-;This is game is very enjoyable. In my opinion i think that if you're into shooters that are slightly more realistic, take more skill than just run and gun all the way and you actually have to put time and effort into then. CS:GO is also very strategy based, if you don't know what to call to tell your teammates where enemies are your team will more than likely lose that game. Make sure you're into that kind of thing and you'll absolutely love CS:GO. I was a bit sceptical at first but then i really got into it and haven't been able to not play it at least once a day. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as i do.
Krom;-;You may think you dont want skins, but eventually youll buy them.
MidnightBron3;-;I hate this game 10/10
SakuraV;-;Highly recommended by me and many others, CS:GO is an amazing game, and very active game, i would highly love to see more people buying CS:GO it's a great choice. Thank you Valve and Steam for this awesome game!
ChubbyNinja;-;Love this game even though i suck at it right now. What makes this game fun is that it's basically about skill not like COD for sure.

Nabs;-;First game : ''Lets go B'' Russian: ''    I go Meadle you noob'' After 100+ hours. More russians spotted. More loses. Now I can speak russians fluently and every russian calls me     ;( 10 / 10
Nightangel;-;After playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive for half a year and discovering most of what it has to offer I think I can give my opinion on it. positive: -Tactical, teambased gameplay -very fluent, bug free gameplay and well optimized -massive amount of options in the settings menu -addictive ranking system -cheap price tag Negative: -Good amount of hackers update: 5.29.15, wall hack has been mostly fixed -Lots of unnecessary ingame purchases -Server issues ending in bans Conclusion: Skins just became more addictive then heroin
Princess Luna's Nightmare;-;Needs more Zombie Escape and Zombie Mod maps and servers!!!
<BOH> Moksh;-;Game's good as compared to other fps games its one of my best games . All features of game are good except the penalty =/ One of best games on steam =) Got nothing more to tell about lol Well Have a nice day :D
Darki;-;It is slowly destroying cs 1.6, but it's worth all about it. (1)Wanna learn Russian? -This game has all the lessons needed. (2)Wanna be called a hacker / noob at the same game? -Enough players ready to do that. (3)Wanna open cases and get a 4 cent skin? -Everytime, no worries. (4)Not good at cs games, bad aim? -Blame the lag. Tell me if i forgot something, also let me show you some types of people you will handle in this lovely game: (Type1) Those who just play normally, don't care about the chat or anyone else. (Type2) Those kind of people who don't play this game seriously, they do their best to troll / be funny. (Type3)  got real, they play like it's their last game! (Type4) Afk people, they join a game just to be afk.. (Type5) Mic spammers, mute everything on your settings before your headphones blow up! *Mostly russians* (Type6) They have no idea what's going on, it's like an "adventure game" for them. This game is full of adventure, it's sometimes a pain in the  however i'm fully recommending it.
VENOMSNAKE-A-BenQ;-;Highly recommend this game. It's the second most famous esport after league of legends and is pretty oldschool, which all of us like. You plant the c4 and defend it from the counter terrorist team, or if you play as ct, you have to defend your bombsites (A and B) from the terrorists. In certain maps, you can rescue hostages, too. This game has also many mods. Casual, competitive (classic ESL game in cs 1.6, but with cs go ranks) If you want to have fun, this game can also offer it, with the other mods, surf, deathrun etc.
GhostJigg;-;VERY GOOD GAME UNTIL YOU HAVE AN AWP AND YOUR SHOOTING THE BAD GUYS AND YOUR TEAM MATES WALK INFRONT OF YOU WITHOUT NOTICING, AND YOU GET BANNED FOR A WEEK.
BullDoser;-;Dis game is very gud. I ain't giving no recommentation for bad game but dis one is very very gud. Gurl, if your a good shooter, you will like dis game. Dere'z steep learnin' curve so noobs be warned - ppl will kick yo asses.
Game Explorer ON VACATION;-;One word: Fantastic
Edd;-;Once this game has aim-down-sights, a major feature of all FPS games, I might actually consider taking it seriously or even, at some point, recommending it.
Commander Walnut;-;Who needs a review? This is CS! Compared to 1.6 and Source - this game definitely holds it's own. No, it's not perfect but its an excellent, up to date version of a multiplayer classic - and in my view - still the finest multiplayer FPS in the world.
yalld;-;One of the best "modern" shooters. As long as you dont define a good fps game something simmlar to another game (for example CoD series or some other fps) this game will be awesome. If you expect awesomley thrilling SP campaign - No. you cna play with bots. but the gameplay may seem "outdated". It is nostalgic, not outdated. It has taken some of the best FPS game features and compined it with CS 1.6 and CS:S. great competiteve excperience. Servers sometimes might not be the best for competiteve experience, but there are some free, better server alternatives. You will not like the game if you expect something like huge map invasions like in Planetside 2 or BattleField series. it has awesome team play elements, hard controlable gun recoil. This game is everything you want if you haev the time to actually learn it, and understand the simplest principals of how it works. after that, It is just practise of aiming and teamplay. Awesome game. 9/10
Thomas *;-;Got A+ on my Russian exam.
Avocado;-;Russian's shold have own csgo, they ruin everything in it. They are just  and doesn't know english at all. AND MOST ANNOYING PART: Gold Nova matches have so many silvers and unranked people, which ruins the fun.
DJSF;-;tl;dr -> Tried this out, eventually opened a few boxes, got some knives and other $100+ gun skins, sold for profit, bought lots of other fun games. Thanks GabeN. 11/10 feeds my digital gambling itch. My route to getting this game was interesting in that I was almost completely turned off what is currently (197.4h at the time of writing this review) my most played game. I initially had traded for this game and accumulated around 20ish hours of playtime, only to have my copy revoked. Fortunately, someone was nice enough to gift me this game a short time later. If you like team-based multiplayer games, gambling by opening boxes, first-person shooters (FPS), gambling by opening boxes, the Counter-Strike series (1.6 was my baby), and gambling, then you will really enjoy this game. The aesthetics are very good - the amount of detail in the background, guns, and character models is well-done. The sounds and music are great and add to the intense atmosphere, but I eventually muted the music in favor of my own (usually Ariana Grande's soothing voice while I unleash hell on my enemies; except in competitive where I don't play music). You can even buy custom music packs if you are offered it randomly, however, I don't recommend doing this unless you have some extra cash (or really love a track); you can "borrow" anyone's custom music if you want to sample. It's nice that the gun sounds are distinct enough that you can identify what weapon is being fired with enough practice. The controls are easy to learn and typical of your standard first-person shooter. There is a very helpful tutorial you can play that shows you everything you need to know (complete with Valve's helpful popup tips). The learning curve is minimal to extreme depending on your experience with FPS games and how far up you intend to climb the competitive ladder (unless you wish to only play casual game modes). I was rusty as I had not been playing FPS games for years (last Counter-Strike title was 1.6, and last FPS was probably Black Ops 2 on the PS3), so I waited until I had 110ish hours of casual play before I felt good enough to play competitive. I haven't turned back since (although I sometimes dabble in casual game modes). There are a variety of game modes like deathmatch, arms race (kills give you a different weapon, and you must eventually obtain a kill with a knife to win), and classic objective games (bomb plant/defusal and hostage rescue). In casual play, there will be a maximum of 10 players on each team, while in competitive play it is always a 5 vs. 5 format (people who are kicked/dropped will be replaced by a controllable bot). Gameplay can be fast-paced and intense, however, at many times (especially in competitive) it can be very slow and equally intense (if not more). Unlike games like Battlefield and Call of Duty, you cannot aim down the sights (ADS) with every weapon; instead, you can only ADS with a scoped battle rifle for either the Terrorist (T) or Counter-Terrorist (CT) side. There are three sniper rifles you can use with 2 levels of zoom. There is a pistol on the Terrorist side that can be switched to burst-fire, and a rifle on the Counter-Terrorist side that can be similarly switched. CT's also have a pistol and assault rifle that starts off with silencer (quieter, more accurate shots) that can be removed. There are a few weapons that can be switched out (ex: the M4A4 for CT's can be switched with the silenced M4A1-S). You can also switch default skins on guns with ones you have in your inventory. These skins can be obtained either through random drops as you play (given at the end of every game) or by opening boxes (this costs money unless you are a trader). You can also obtain skins from the steam marketplace (or even outside it), but I highly recommend you check resources like /r/GlobalOffensiveTrade on reddit to help you out. In combat, you can crouch, but not go prone. You cannot climb/mantle over objects, however, you can "boost" in competitive game modes (where unit collision is allowed) by jumping onto a crouched player in order to reach a higher position. There is recoil in the game, and accurate range plays an important role in determining whether or not you will actually hit your opponent. Bullets can travel through material like doors and various types of cover for less damage. Wearing a helmet will block one shot to the head, however, and other subsequent headshots will result in an instant kill. Game matches consist of several rounds (15 in casual, 30 in competitive, best of), and at the beginning of each round you must purchase your equipment - consisting of your primary and secondary weapons, armor/defusal kit/hostage rescue kit, and grenades (smoke, flash, decoy, etc). You can hold one primary and one secondary weapon. If you die, you will start the next round with only the default starting pistol. If you live, you will refill ammo for whatever weapons you are holding. Money is used to buy all items, and money is given to all players depending on their performance (ex: winning side gets more money). A critical element in this game is the lack of self-regeneration - what you have is what you have. Your health is only refilled when a new round begins, so playing smartly will aid you greatly. I do recommend playing competitive to help you understand the mechanics of the game better - there are generally a lot of nice people willing to help new players. Overall, the game is easily one of my favorite in the FPS genre (and this is being raised also as a Battlefield and Call of Duty child) and is even more amazing if you can manage to play with friends. If you are interested in multiplayer FPS gameplay at all, you definitely must check this out. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND! Cheers, DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews
Fermented Semen;-;[Negative] - 1000h of CSGO and still a silver scrub. - My mom hates me. - My family hate me. - My friends hate me. [Positive] - Made 5$ selling crates and negevs.
toc;-;I try to make this as short as possible, but there will still be some lines of text: I bought this game near the date of the release. My Account is more than 11 years old. I bought more than 250 games. Recently my friends asked me to play competitive matches with them. I joined them, it was a hell lot of fun. BUT - I was banned (a so called "cooldown") for each 21 hours the last 3 days because some kind of an anti-smurf "feature". After winning 2 matches you will get banned (they call it cooldown, but you will actually get banned. Naming a ban cooldown doesn't change the effect). Valve FAQ says to you, this is no big deal. You can play the other game modes, like casual or against bots. Yeah, that changes everything... Not. The competitive mode is the only reason I started playing CS:GO again, and so will many others. You have to keep in mind, you bought the game, and you are getting restricted because they want to prevent smurfs trolling around. But they do the exact opposite. I will explain that later in this review. I can't say the words here I wan't to, cause that would remove this review instantly. I am so frustrated, seeing my friends play all night long, knowing it is so much fun. Yes, the gameplay is fantastic. Intense fun. But why in world isn't there some kind of filter?! I probably spent several 1000. of Euros on Steam. The only possible reason with a healthy human mind would be Valve wanting the people to buy several copies of the game. And guess what: That's what Smurfs actually do. To summarize: Smurfs buy several copies. Legit people don't. So Multiple Accounts give an ADVANTAGE to smurfs compared to legit customers. This logic must come from one real brainiac at Valve! And the best thing I just experienced: Even the draws count as a "win". So: If you would play very close matches (which is the intention of a functioning matchmaking system) and you always get draws, you would get banned everyday for 21 hours. That's because you need 10 wins to get ranked. And only after this first 10 wins you would get rid of this mess of a smurf protection system. This can take like forever. Even with 1 win and 1 draw per playing session, this would take at least 10 days. Beeing a normal worker, you can't even play everyday. Having a family or other RL responsibilities makes this a real torture. You have to play a month here and there single sessions for 2-3 games, than quitting(getting banned), waiting at least one day (your friends might not have the exact same time slots as you do), playing another 2-3 games, and this until you reach 10 wins. This is absolutely rediculous. A real shame. By the way: Contacting the Valve Support ends up in getting an automatic response, saying that there is no chance of getting unbanned from this anti smurf system. Maybe Valve invests more time in counting money these days....
Oh!;-;this game sucks in so many ways, valve cheat engine sucks, million cheating people, the matchmaking sucks it always brings pro players with unranked players which is stupid, and im still playing this .
McFlurry;-;Bought the game in a sale for 3,75$ found a case worth 6$ 10/10 thanks for free money valve!
Fedora the Pussy Explora;-;I gambled away 100$ on cases and keys only to get a skin of 5 dollars in return and no knives 10/10 will Gamble again :D
Greenleaf;-;This game is an excellent game, and I enjoy it very much. However I would not recommend this game to anyone else. The community of this game is rude, cruel, and out to ruin your day. They will ridicule you for your every mistake, loose your games intentionally, and try to break you down. The problem with the community is not everyone, but is a large enough population to effect you. To anyone who has been mean to me in this game, you have made me cry at night. I guess you got what you wanted...
Purplewolfies;-;some of the skins are nice, but the community is , its full of smurfs, and hackers, s and trolls, and the ban system is unusable at best, completely broken at worst, get kicked too many times? BAN kick to many people? BAN report too many people? BAN why have the options for these things and have them be penalized for being used???? honestly i really enjoy this game in the RARE times where i dont get a smurf or hacker or s on the other team, wait till its on sale to buy it, but OH WAIT thats not all bob when the game does go on sale thats just another wave of smurfs and hackers buying the game becuase its extrememly cheap, please fix this valve, please for the love of god fix this  EDIT: every time theres a sale, legit every ing time, a new wave of cheaters and smurfs get brand new accounts to  around with ruining the experience for the people actually trying thier godamn hardest to ing rank up, however with the introduction of the secondary rank system, at least they wont show up in competetive right?, right???, though now its even easier for people to cheat in casual and deathmatch becuase guess what, you gotta play those before you can get ranked enough to play competetive, yipee, even more useless ing overwatch reports, WOOOHOOOOO

Crackbon;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive The legendary series of online shooters. Great gameplay and cooperation with other players. A very large number of players playing this game. I will try to describe it in the pros and cons. Pros + Very good gameplay. + Good graphics. + Game worth the price. + Extras added to the Gamesas weapons skins and maps. + You can earn money for playing. + pashaBiceps. + The ranking system. + Steam workshop. + Several new weapons. + Many server mods like zombies, surf and other. Cons - Tickrate 64 <3. - Some bugs but not much. - Cheaters, Smurfs and Trolls. - Wonderful matchmaking. The game presents a lot of advantages and disadvantages but is recommendable. I gives 9/10

Snowdust;-;Guns, Knives, and Skins Let's Roll.
Quiet Ambassador;-;"If you could see it, then you'd understand." That glistening anti-koan punctuates the chorus of Coldplay's skyscraping 2005 single "Speed of Sound", and the lyric's profound meaninglessness has doubled as a mission statement for the mega-band's career thus far. They've established a reputation as mainstream rock's koi pond architects, designing music that's deceptively shallow but, if caught at the right moment, shimmeringly beautiful, to the point that you could focus on it for hours. Impossibly indulgent on a sonic level while retaining the intellectual depth of a cell phone commercial, Coldplay's catalog is largely experientiala reflecting pool for the hopes, dreams, and heartaches that listeners wish to apply to the music. This pliability has meant that Coldplay can come off as impersonal, a gaseous giant of anonymity in rock music's solar system; nearly 10 years ago, the stultifyingly dense third album X&Y threatened to swallow the band completely, as Coldplay refined the post-post-punk affectations of 2002's A Rush of Blood to the Head until they were left with an immobile monolith. On the verge of overreaching, Coldplay doubled down with 2008's Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends, a world-beating document of giddy experimentation and costume-rock bathos that stands as their most thrilling, impressionistic work. Mylo Xyloto followed three years later, which took its predecessor's widescreen template and enlarged it to IMAX-size, indulging in rave-y piano stabs and night-flight flourishes with the color-filled exuberance of a child that can't stop eating crayons. Mylo Xyloto was further proof that Coldplay are at their best when they embrace their corniest impulses; their sixth album, Ghost Stories, finds them taking a sharp left turn. Preceded by the non-single "Midnight", a watery electro-folk Bon Iver facsimile accompanied with a video reminiscent of an iTunes visualizer, nearly everything about the arrival of Ghost Stories has seemed small: the nine-song tracklist, the spartan, deep-blue angel's-wings cover, the disappointing lack of costumes. The absence of grandiosity signaled to eager fans and sneering bystanders alike that, this time around, something might be a little off. That something can be traced to Martin's marriage to actress and $600-hand-cream guru Gwyneth Paltrow, which quietly imploded in March of this year. More a separation than an outright divorce, recent court documents revealed that the couple are still living together, and in a 2008 SPIN profile, the only subject that the otherwise affable Martin bristled against discussing was his personal life with Paltrow. As long as the world's known him, Chris Martin has also proved impossible to truly know, so whether his recent familial troubles would seep into his band's latest was anyone's guess. And yet, Ghost Stories is unmistakably Coldplay's "breakup album," a subdued work that finds Martin and his band crisply moping through mid-tempo soundscapes and fuzzy electronic touches that have the visceral impact of a down comforter tumbling down a flight of stairs. Featuring production from longtime collaborators Daniel Green and Rik Simpson, along with behind-the-boards pro Paul Epworth, drone-techno auteur Jon Hopkins, and Kanye West collaborator Mike Dean, the record is serene and weightless to a fault. Coldplay abandon the musical tourism and extroverted strides of their last few albums and find themselves adrift. The closest the record comes to a bona fide anthem is the moderately enjoyable "A Sky Full of Stars", a rocket-fueled single on the level of "Clocks" and "Speed of Sound" tainted by Swedish dance producer AVICII's cheap-sounding drum presets and boilerplate synth motifs. "I don't care/ If you tear me apart," Martin wails at the peak of the song's endless chorus, a passionate exclamation that doubles one of the most nakedly personal admissions he's made on record. Ghost Stories certainly sounds like the product of someone working out their private pain in public; unfortunately, the results are less Blood on the Tracks and more "Can I Borrow a Feeling?". Coldplay's catalog has plenty of examples where Martin's words have failed him, but his diaristic reflections on Ghost Stories are abnormally painful. "Tell me you love me/ If you don't, then lie," he coos on the Spandau Ballet-gone-Disney ballad "True Love"; during the plodding "Another's Arms", he ruminates on lost domestic bliss watching TV with a loved one, "Your body on my body." If the expression of carnal closeness-via-TiVo makes you cringe, imagine how he feels. "Ink" is the album's most indefensible moment, musically and lyrically, and the song handily snatches the title of Worst Coldplay Song from X&Y's impossibly leaden, in'-magnets stinker "What If". "Got a tattoo/ And the pain's alright," Martin cries while running through a series of love-as-permanence metaphors, over rippling guitar and burbling atmospherics ripped from Phil Collins' Tarzan soundtrack. The last time Coldplay indulged in "rainforest rock," it was Viva La Vida's transcendent, gorgeous "Strawberry Swing", which featured Martin exclaiming beatifically, "It's such a perfect day"; on "Ink", he moves from vine to vine until swinging in solitude at the track's end, exclaiming with a sigh, "All I know is that I love you so/ So much that it hurts." Fittingly, "Ink" is one of the few tracks on Ghost Stories that leaves a mark, and that's partially due to Martin's lovely-as-ever vocals; when not chronicling his own pain, he occasionally breaks into appealing birdsong, a wordless pitter-patter that marks the chorus of the record's pleasant-enough lead single, "Magic". Otherwise, Ghost Stories is a collection of unmemorable songs from a band that's made enough memories to last a lifetime. Everything sounds pristinethis is a Coldplay album, and instrumentally the band is as exacting as everbut by the dreary piano-led closer "O", you're left with a series of songs that are fragile, plain, and forgettable. Conventional wisdom says X&Y is Coldplay's worst album, but amidst that record's shiftless bloat, there were real-deal highlights that hit with blunt impact and have since stood the test of time. Ghost Stories contains no such moments, and thus threatens to rob X&Y of its dubious title. Its intimate nature shares the most kinship with Coldplay's first album, 2000's peerless Parachutes. Twelve years later, that album sounds like the work of a different band, and that's because it is; Coldplay have become one of the biggest acts in the world since their comparatively modest debut, and as a result Ghost Stories' attempts to return to close-mic'd intimacy come across as out-of-touch as Lucille Bluth asking how much a banana costs. The callback to Parachutes' hushed whispers also means that Ghost Stories is the first time Coldplay has sounded explicitly self-referential. They're a band that's withstood enough comparisons to U2 over the years, and the warmed-over leftovers that have marked Bono and Co.'s last decade as a creative entity are enough to suggest that, if Coldplay continue to head down the path of addressing their own legacy, their best moments are truly behind them.
Kannoli.;-;CS:GO  Yourself.
Shy*chi;-;A nice game with the traditional Counter-Strike feeling, i'm not much of a reviewer, the aiming feels alot different compared to 1.6, CZ or Css. I really like the graphical design of the game and it's really fun to play with friends, i like the addition of skins in this game purely for the reason of seeing the same guns all the time can get quite boring, and for some people that likes to collect items for games but never gotten into the more heavier item games such as tf2 or other things, it can be quite nice, though of course there are the fair share of fools who believe that skins makes you imediately better, it really doesn't. But i'd recommend the game, it's kinda fun, but you can get banned if you're too good in a low skillbracket. Just saying.
Nitro987;-;I only have about 35 hours on this game and i now know fluent Russian. This is literetly the best Russian guide i have ever bought. Highly recommended if you do not know Russian, yet.

Kingdom;-;If im going to compare this, and CSS. I want to say, that CSS is more for the fun stuff, like: Minigame, Gungame, Surf, Ba_jail and ETC. But CS:GO, this game, its a really good game actually, in the start i was thinking it was bad. Well i was wrong, this game is very good, but i think its mostly for the competitive players. Btw, there is also a new game mode, demolution. If you want to play serious, you should get this instead of CSS. This game is worth the full price! 4.5/5

Sinatra Jr.;-;I've been playing this game for a little over a year now, I've had fun but it just seems to be dying out for me. The VAC protection is probably the worst Anti-Cheat I've ever seen in my life. Don't get me wrong I still do enjoy this game but not as much as I used to. I remember playing it for hours on end now I have trouble playing 2 games without getting frustrated. I don't really know what to say but give this game a try and see if you'll enjoy it.
Kevin Owens;-;Better then porn.
Kubix;-;I've wasted a lot of time in this game. I think, I finally can say my own opinion. First of all, this game doesn't have an optimisation. Even though, you have a very powerful computer, it still will be lagging as  as it's possible. Secondly, VAC Anti-cheat doesn't work properly. There are many cheaters and what's very important, Valve doesn't give a ! In addition, the rank system in this game is totally unfair. You can be de-ranked for no reason. Also, there can be some people who have very low rank but they still can play like the global elite players( I don't mean about people who have the second account with low rank). Furthermore, the real community of this game consists of the ing idiots who cannot play well and they can only complain for some . As well as, annoying and pulling whole team down can be made by them. Unfortunately, it's really hard to find someone who can play well and without any doubt, show the real meaning of teamplay. By the way, about those things like the skins or something like this that don't make any sense. Valve is trying to get some money in the different ways. Especially, it's associated to the ing crates and keys. I completely don't recommend you to buy them, you'll actually lose money. In conclusion, this game definitely sucks and it can lead you to get a brain cancer. What's really funny that I will never stop playing this . Probably, I am already addicted. Here is a small advice for Valve: Valve, you are supposed to do something useful for this game that can really improve it.
MaximumBunny;-;Case Drop Simulator 2012. 10/10 GOTY thx for the wallet.
June Snowpaw;-;Probably one of the worst games I've ever played. Runs like shit. Looks like shit. Performs like shit. Multiplayer is shit. You get paid to hack. Valve fully supports hacker in order to make money. I get more FPS on Crysis 2. ESEA or bust. Shit/10
Candles;-;If you aren't 21 buy this, it's basicaly a casino!
Tristan;-;Counter-Strike is said to be the most popular tactical team-based first-person shooter with a timeless soul. The fourth full-fledged part of this game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, makes old school players feel at (renovated) home. The rules are known to all yet hardly anyone knows everything and its obvious that devil is in the details. You can play in several modes but classic competitive deserves attention primarily. Five terrorists against five counter-terrorists in two varieties: planting/defusing bomb or detention/release of hostages. The formula is simple but not simplistic. Its a pity that there are many players trying to cheat. Fortunately, some of them are consistently disqualified by Valve. The most beautiful thing in this game is visible growth and major obstacle may be the first steps and initial figuring out the system and players behavior... There are neither unusual skills nor fancy tricks. The tools are simple - a dozen guns and other weapons like grenades as well as your ideas and tactics, which you can share with others, that actually being a must. It is gratifying that this product is still being patched and from time to time new maps are created and there are real gems among them. Well, of course its a chance to meet a lot of great gamers with whom you can play other productions as well. You must be prepared to be yelled at sometimes. You may hear you dont know how to play, that you are f**king noob with no skill. One way or another, CS:GO teaches humility and cooperation. I've never been an avid fan of this series but this game is really addictive because I am able to feel that I play better with each match. The magic progress is oozing and there is no way to measure this numerically.
BlaqkAudio;-;Game is for nubs. 11/10 would bang again
SPAGHETTI PEPE;-;Too many smurfs This makes me cry :( Btw this is my smurf account BUT i got a higher rank here so i mostly play here. I just cant rank up on my main because i always meet cheaters and or other smurfers... JUST KIDDING XDDDDDDDDDDDD
Lego;-;If you haven't already played a Counter Strike game then you're doing something wrong. Global Offensive is just like the rest, simply improved as time progresses. Best part of the Counter Strike series is that you know exactly what to expect from each new installment.
Tcole1289;-;in love this game
GG.Sunshiners;-;Another game by the valve company, its the Counter Strike ! The game that we all should love. The competitive part of the gameplay is full with teamwork, skill and tactics, its nice that team with a leader (A guy that command his/her teamates via team chat or voice chat) will always win if they are against a team without a proper leader. Soo the teamwork in this game is very superb. All the weapons in this game is balanced, so no matter which gun you used, as long as you can used it, you can kill even an opponent with a more expensive gun than you, i see alot players with a 800$ weapon win against a players with a 5000$ weapon. And if you didn't like competitive you can have fun too with a Call of duty style team deathmatch, and free for all. Its really fun, all you need to do in this mode is to just kill the enemy, killing another players in this mode is really fun and a stress reliever. Recommended to all competitive and also casual players ! PS: You can actually earned money from this game item drop, so you can actually have fun and earned money. :D
Ramp;-;More like 1.6 than source ever was.. Most of the guns are viable if used in the proper situations. Skill ranking in competitive matches. What could be better?
#tethernet's back;-;this is good game
IronBack | Elfein7Night;-;Shoot chickens, Ignore everything else.
DerpyNoobey;-;Tis better than CoD. Always better. Enough Said, Mate.
Jasperleleeel;-;Quite the game. Excellent choice for FPS lovers, and classic CS Veterans.
possboss;-;Great game and very much in the spirit of C.S. Source with a mashup of T.F.2. Snatch it on the sale and benefit from all the awesome skins and weapon deets. Must have if you are into fps!!!
[] Corbin away for 1 week;-;HOLY CRAP THIS GAME!! Its way to different to call of duty to even compare it to that. It is the best multiplayer game ive ever played and is great for people with game sense on the fact that you know where people will be camping and you know where people will go. And it is also good for team tactics unlike some other FPS games where you just go round shooting people (Call Of Duty). 10/10 buy this game 100% worth it!!
~GAME OVER;-;nice game buy it.
Wumbo;-;Got frustrated, broke the back of my keyboard, said I would never play this game again. Got back on 30 minutes later and spent $60 on virtual keys and skins in order to look cool over a video game. No ragrets. 10/10

H E X I E;-;I'd say one of the best first person shooters that actually require skill. 10/10

LaK_LaK;-;come play this great game! hackers are all over the place it's great!
Dys;-;Share your favorite 00's pop radio hits with your friendly opponents in your next competitive lobby!
Not Splaver;-;A worthy update to Counter-Strike: Source, CS:GO improves upon tons of mechanics that were lack-luster, or made the game too easy to get good at in it's predecessor. I think it's clearly safe to say this game also removed the stain left in the professional Counter-Strike community after a few CAL judges made unnecessary bans to advance their teams through tournaments. It's already had almost two dozen torunaments with multiple professional 5-man teams that many may recognize from CS 1.6. This game made quick work to fix some things that were decidedly annoying in CS:S, one being the too-often consistent bullet patterns when not on a flat surface(e.g. jumping, surfing, et cetera.) Some guns have been removed(looking at you MP5, and M3.), although they have been given replacements, and are joined with other new weapons that make the game much more fresh, and keep things interesting. Overall, combining this with the skin updates that will now be regular, the game can even pay for itself within a few weeks! The features allowing you to download demos of your games, watch the pros and casual high ranks alike live, and tons of exclusives for watching tournaments not only brings up community morale, but increases the excitement of the game. You can also link your twitch account to make it all easier. Very cool. Community servers are surprisingly still full, and almost as numerous as the last 3 games, even though Competitive play has been enhanced with an ELO system, and ranks to go along with it. Like always, if you can get good at this game, you'll be good at any First Person Shooter, making it a key title to own and play. It brings a set of new graphics that are amazing to compare to the other CS games(nostlagia withstanding), made all the better because of Valve's typical work to offload Graphics Processing to the CPU when possible. For what it's worth, it hardly tolls even low-end GPUs like my current 525M, with maxed settings, and very high levels of Anti-Aliasing. I'm able to keep a minimum of 80 Frames Per Second, and average about 150. All in all, I'm pleased to say that I have over 600 hours sunk into this game, and am only about 200 hours off surpassing my CS:S playtime as of writing. Valve did an amazing job with this game, and I can't wait to see what it's successor in Source 2 will look like!
Nue;-;I don't recommend if you are bound to get upset over a game. Why you may ask? You have to deal with man-children. Alot of them.
Skell*;-;Command and Strike: Global Alert is a game. This turn-based, roleplaying game combimes stealth and action not too distant to the Assassin's Creed series. Unlike the Assassin's Creed series, however, this game doesn't mess around. A risky lack of story really pays off with the powerful emphasis on coopertative puzzle solving. I'd caution new players to the Call of Strike: Global Warfare series, as the steep learning curve is somewhat of a disservice to the overall experience. However, if you can get over that curvature with ease, the experience opens up a lot of interesting rpg elements not typically seen in a third person shooter. If you're looking for a similar feel to the antiquated versions of this game but with more refined visuals, there's no reason to not pick this up. I give this real-time strategy visual novel a Snow White out of a Disney Princess.
No internet for months;-;Are you bored often? Are you socially inferior? Are you willing to spend hours on hours on this game? Are you willing to spend all of your parents money on knife/weapon skins? Then get CS:GO! The best fps game in stores right now!
pyon;-;you shoot people trying even harder to shoot you.

--ASiAnNerDZ-- CSGOReactor.com;-;ITS SICKIAGSSE JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJUUUUUUUUU\UUUUUST BUY IT LAL WHILE IT ON OFFER 3 DAM GUDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DEAL
Ice;-;I am one of those  'veterans', who started playing with counter strike 1.6 (didn't have my own account by those time, though) and I have long story of 'relationship' with counter strike universe and csgo universe especially. Telling in advance - I made long way from hating csgo up to loving it. But anyway, to the point: For people, who don't know what counter strike is, and who never heard about this game before: Counter strike is unique semi-reallistic game, which is build around global opposition of different terrorist groups (somali pirates, phoenix connection, etc) and different law enforcement groups (SAS, GIGN, GSG-9, SWAT, FBI etc). Game features several rounds (from 16 up to 32, depends on a gamemode and server rules), where every player have only one life per round. As soon as round time ends, or one of the teams eliminated, round is finished. After every round players respawn and acquire a sum of money to buy a weapon and different gadgets (armor, flash and smoke grenades, etc). Game features several game modes: (classic) hostage rescue (maps with ct_prefix): Counter Terrorists must steal hostage (or any of the several hostages) from a place, secured by terrorists and bring this hostage to a safe zone. As soon as hostage is brought, or whole terrorist team eliminated, counter terrorists win. If time ends and counter terrorists did not bring hostage to a safe area, terrorists win. As soon as counter terrorist carries hostage, whone CT team gets extra 1:30 minute time to reach safe place. (classic) bomb defuse (maps with de_prefix): Terrorists must blow one of two bomb plants. Problem is, there's only one bomb per whole team. As soon as bomb carrying terrorist falls dead, another terrorist can pick the bomb and plant it at the bomb plant point. Counter terrorists can not destroy the bomb or bring it to another place, if it's fallen. As soon as bomb is planted, round time stops and to win, counter terrorists must defuse bomb. If bomb is blown, even though all terrorists are dead, terrorist team wins the round. gungame (Honestly, forgive me if I make mistake here, but it's one of the gametypes I barely played): The least teamplay addicted game type. You start with one of the weakest weapons and as soon as you kill anyone, you get new weapon. As soon as you come through all the weapons (including knife), you win the map. You instantly respawn after death. I remember there was also gungame gametype, where you had only one life, but gungame is not my cup of tea, so let's finish on this. deathmatch: Also one of the gametypes where you respawn right after death. But, unlike gungame, you choose weapon you want at the start of a new life. You should kill as many enemies, as you can. Thanks to respawn in random places of the map, fight itself reminds a messy war, where enemy can shoot you in the back (just because he respawned there) and so on. I don't normally play this gametype aswell, but if I remember right, this gametype was brought by community. Also, community made more gametypes, like zombiemod, bunnyhop (or whatever is it called) and deathrun, where you need to reach some point. Now, for people who played cs for a while. Main differences from cs 1.6 and css here are: partially new weapons, updated radio commands, updated hostage rescue mode, where you need to actually PICK UP only ONE hostage and bring him to the safe place. Weapons have changed physics, so you'll need to learn everything again. And, an old problem, which became more important duo to competative gamemode: CHEATERS! Can't say there are many cheaters, but when you meet them, whole fun is ruined. Same when you meet stupid people. As we reviewed the game (I tried to be as short as possible), I'll express my mind on it: Firstly, I hated this game. It seemed like you need to deliver like 10 hits to your enemy. It had (and it still has) changed radio commands (yes, I was one of those few people, who used radio commands), you couldn't (and still can't) choose your player model (only team, like in css beta), you had and (still have) some grenades, which, probably don't even exist (decoy and incendinary, the molotov analogue, btw molotov here bounces from the wall, wtf?), or at least I was unable to find any info about them. In hostage rescue mode, why would you need to save only ONE hostage? Why would cops leave another one behind? You couldn't place silencer on M4 and 'base ct pistol', or use flashlight and many more things which I couldn't remeber right now. With time, Valve fixed their gaps, and I came to some re-analysis of the situation: First of all let's all agree with the fact, that cs:go is, unlike css, a complete SEQUEL of an online game, so OF COURSE it should have some differences, like radio commands, weapon reballance and stuff More over, with time it turns out, you don't need to hit your enemy 10 times, it's just you moving, so THAT'S WHY you don't hit the enemy. The ballance itself is still the same: 1-6 shots, depends on what weapons do you use; Indeed, you can't use player model, but they made 5 different models for each side, so you'll have no more 3 twins, out of 5 people playing, which, actually, compensates your choice of the model. Some changes were made for the sake of ballance (talking of hostages and some weapons' accuracy) Grenades... Well, firstly, I can't say these grenades are something sci-fi like. I believe that even if they don't exist, humanity can create them, using our own technologies. Also, Valve made special inventory, where people choose skins for their weapons and after few updates they brought us some old weapons, so now, you can use old good m4a1 with silencer, just as you did in css and cs 1.6, among with USP and it's silencer and another new pistol for exchange. They also made different skins for all weapons, so you can buy any skin you like and have your weapon in unique military\funny color (though, imo, it's a bit annoying to see all colors of the rainbow on some players' weapons, just because they love colorful schemes). Talking about radio commands again, it's better using VOIP instead of them, so updating radio is not a big deal... And now, I'd say, the best part of cs:go - it's competative mode. Competative mode features only classic gamemodes. In competative mode you play 5vs5. The more wins you get, the higher your rank is, the higher your rank is, the harder opponents and better allies are met. Competative mode is where whole TACTICAL potential of a game is shown. There's no map with perfect spot, enemy can always attack from the side, so you need to coordinate with your allies to cover each other, or rush same place from different directions, to capture it, with no any losses. Here's where all weapons are needed: short range weapons are the best for ambushes behind the corner, long range weapons are the best for long distances and medium range weapons are somewhat between long and short range. Though medium range weapons are the most often used, I must admit. You can play in a party with your friends, but be ready, because game will give you more cooperated team. Of course, not everything is perfect - sometimes game gives you wrong ranks, or you meet always-raging-idiot, or, what is worse, cheater, who kills you through the wall, but all in all it's a good game. A good sequel of one of the best tactical games of the end of the 90ths. What else can I say? If you like tactical shooters and you somehow never heard of counter strike, or you are thinking of buying it or not, my advice is not to waste your time and buy this game. It's just the game you should 'understand'. Too bad that biggest part of our youth is used to judge every game comparing to call of duty and quite often misses really good tactical games.
Ghosty;-;You shoot things and they shoot you.
Phrozen;-;I've played CS since It was a mod for Half-Life. Upon returning with much skepticism to the CS genre with CS: Go, I was blown away. Looks and feels almost just like the CS I've always known. Another winner of course......Keeping it classy as always Valve.

FreeZe - Askov <3;-;Its a very good game. You get a lot for the low ammount of money it cost :)
jah war;-;Counter-strikes: globals offensive is a game which has surely bucked the trend in making a new counter strikes games as they have put the AWP in TF2 instead which is a better game. my least favourite part of this new counter strikes is when i was was running down the hill at the terrorism man and i shot him first, but he shot me instead. This is like that controversy in star wars when they say 'ham shot the man first' because when georgie lucas remade the film with better actors (it's called Lord Of The Rings if you are interested in watching, the special effects are to die for and there is a talking tree which is just genius) ham solo was shot in the face and died, which made lots of people sad because he was a really good actor, especially that bit when he got frozen in the black ice stuff andhad to stand still in an uncomfortable position for a really long time. I once had a job where i was on the register at a shop and had to stand still for a really long time but i entertained myself by committing minor acts of shoplifting. Really it all just comes back to crime and if you want to be the counter terrorism guy and shoot the bad guys in the face this is the game for you. But if you are a renegade soul who just needs to see the world burn like the bad guy in that batman film who died then i would suggest a different game like Peggle.
Jack of all Trades #VACation;-;This game will bring you alot of fun and hours played, I've played the first counterstrike 7 years ago. I've been a Counter-Strike fan since I first tried it out. I've got a total of 4000 hours in total of all the counter-strike games combined over my 7 years of service. This game is alot of fun and the operations are really great! If you feel like you don't hit, either become a better player by training your aim and reaction, or you could switch from Valves standard 64 tick (64 updates per second) to a paid 128 tick server (Costs if you're gonna do it the pro way, some free servers for it in the server browser). This game is very cheap and on some sales (which is common), it can cost around 3. That's the price you sell one or two cases for, which drops very common! This game is updated and maintained alot. This is a very good game and I support it to 100%.
Trixter   #Banned;-;Best FPS Game of d Century!!!
AnalIceCubeFantasy;-;Great game, usually a one time fee of $15 but the past winter sale had it at $2.99/copy. Valve does have some work to do on this game, while other games have balancing issues and a crappy player base, this game is not so much affected by that so much as it is affected by the subpar servers. About 95% uptime, but when they go down you get a penalty for "leaving the match" and get banned from competitive servers. This may happen multiple times in a row, and an undeserving player may find themselves left with much rage and a 7 day ban.
ZippyWins;-;Cant stop playing
Imran;-;Awesome graphics. Must buy this game if you love FPS games
Allu Azad;-;It's Ok.
Rigz;-;what can i say the mother of all FPS games for me, been playing since a little bit before cs 1.6. CS GO can still improve on some things in the future, but already where it belongs on top of the FPS games
PunchyBigBelly;-;CS: GO guns Rarity: (From most common to least common.) 1) - White - Consumer grade 2) - Light blue - Industrial grade 3) - Darker blue - Mil-spec 4) - Purple - Restricted 5) - Pinkish purple - Classified 6) - Red - Covert 7) - Exceedingly Rare  CS: GO guns Quality: (From worst exterior to best exterior.) 1) - Battle-Scarred 2) - Well-Worn 3) - Field-Tested 4) - Minimal Wear 5) - Factory New
anon;-;CS:GO is currently my favorite game. No other game comes close to this one. CS:GO is a great game for casual and serious gamers. If you want to have some fun you can just join a casual match or browse the community servers for nice community made mods, like jailbreak, Hide'n'Seek or Zombie Escape. But you can also play serious games by joining competitive games. Those require 2 full teams made of 5 players. They play a full match against each other. Every single match is recorded which means you can report cheaters and other bad gamers. Cheaters get banned pretty fast in this game, sometimes they don't even last 3 hours and they account is banned. This game beats other games like Battlefield for CoD when it comes to competitive gameplay. Once you played cs:go you can't go back to them anymore because they feel like kiddy games. You can also download a lot of custom maps made by the community, Valve doesn't forces you to buy DLC's like other game publishers.
[R]R!C;-;Another addictive game after cs 1.6. I enjoy each and every moment when I play this game. #CsForever<3
WarriorVet;-;First off, if you play other shooters and are the same way I am. You will hate this game at first. There is no aiming. The game is very frusterating until you really get the hang of it. There is no realism here at all, even if they think there is....but the game still manages to be fun after spending some time in it and really learning what I was doing. Requires patience because you will die alot.

With time, Valve fixed their gaps, and I came to some re-analysis of the situation: First of all let's all agree with the fact, that cs:go is, unlike css, a complete SEQUEL of an online game, so OF COURSE it should have some differences, like radio commands, weapon reballance and stuff More over, with time it turns out, you don't need to hit your enemy 10 times, it's just you moving, so THAT'S WHY you don't hit the enemy. The ballance itself is still the same: 1-6 shots, depends on what weapons do you use; Indeed, you can't use player model, but they made 5 different models for each side, so you'll have no more 3 twins, out of 5 people playing, which, actually, compensates your choice of the model. Some changes were made for the sake of ballance (talking of hostages and some weapons' accuracy) Grenades... Well, firstly, I can't say these grenades are something sci-fi like. I believe that even if they don't exist, humanity can create them, using our own technologies. Also, Valve made special inventory, where people choose skins for their weapons and after few updates they brought us some old weapons, so now, you can use old good m4a1 with silencer, just as you did in css and cs 1.6, among with USP and it's silencer and another new pistol for exchange. They also made different skins for all weapons, so you can buy any skin you like and have your weapon in unique military\funny color (though, imo, it's a bit annoying to see all colors of the rainbow on some players' weapons, just because they love colorful schemes). Talking about radio commands again, it's better using VOIP instead of them, so updating radio is not a big deal... And now, I'd say, the best part of cs:go - it's competative mode. Competative mode features only classic gamemodes. In competative mode you play 5vs5. The more wins you get, the higher your rank is, the higher your rank is, the harder opponents and better allies are met. Competative mode is where whole TACTICAL potential of a game is shown. There's no map with perfect spot, enemy can always attack from the side, so you need to coordinate with your allies to cover each other, or rush same place from different directions, to capture it, with no any losses. Here's where all weapons are needed: short range weapons are the best for ambushes behind the corner, long range weapons are the best for long distances and medium range weapons are somewhat between long and short range. Though medium range weapons are the most often used, I must admit. You can play in a party with your friends, but be ready, because game will give you more cooperated team. Of course, not everything is perfect - sometimes game gives you wrong ranks, or you meet always-raging-idiot, or, what is worse, cheater, who kills you through the wall, but all in all it's a good game. A good sequel of one of the best tactical games of the end of the 90ths. What else can I say? If you like tactical shooters and you somehow never heard of counter strike, or you are thinking of buying it or not, my advice is not to waste your time and buy this game. It's just the game you should 'understand'. Too bad that biggest part of our youth is used to judge every game comparing to call of duty and quite often misses really good tactical games.
Bulitz;-;Got the game free from a friend Spent quadruple what the games worth on skins Ruined my life, spent all of my life savings
Not Splaver;-;A worthy update to Counter-Strike: Source, CS:GO improves upon tons of mechanics that were lack-luster, or made the game too easy to get good at in it's predecessor. I think it's clearly safe to say this game also removed the stain left in the professional Counter-Strike community after a few CAL judges made unnecessary bans to advance their teams through tournaments. It's already had almost two dozen torunaments with multiple professional 5-man teams that many may recognize from CS 1.6. This game made quick work to fix some things that were decidedly annoying in CS:S, one being the too-often consistent bullet patterns when not on a flat surface(e.g. jumping, surfing, et cetera.) Some guns have been removed(looking at you MP5, and M3.), although they have been given replacements, and are joined with other new weapons that make the game much more fresh, and keep things interesting. Overall, combining this with the skin updates that will now be regular, the game can even pay for itself within a few weeks! The features allowing you to download demos of your games, watch the pros and casual high ranks alike live, and tons of exclusives for watching tournaments not only brings up community morale, but increases the excitement of the game. You can also link your twitch account to make it all easier. Very cool. Community servers are surprisingly still full, and almost as numerous as the last 3 games, even though Competitive play has been enhanced with an ELO system, and ranks to go along with it. Like always, if you can get good at this game, you'll be good at any First Person Shooter, making it a key title to own and play. It brings a set of new graphics that are amazing to compare to the other CS games(nostlagia withstanding), made all the better because of Valve's typical work to offload Graphics Processing to the CPU when possible. For what it's worth, it hardly tolls even low-end GPUs like my current 525M, with maxed settings, and very high levels of Anti-Aliasing. I'm able to keep a minimum of 80 Frames Per Second, and average about 150. All in all, I'm pleased to say that I have over 600 hours sunk into this game, and am only about 200 hours off surpassing my CS:S playtime as of writing. Valve did an amazing job with this game, and I can't wait to see what it's successor in Source 2 will look like!
Nue;-;I don't recommend if you are bound to get upset over a game. Why you may ask? You have to deal with man-children. Alot of them.
Skell*;-;Command and Strike: Global Alert is a game. This turn-based, roleplaying game combimes stealth and action not too distant to the Assassin's Creed series. Unlike the Assassin's Creed series, however, this game doesn't mess around. A risky lack of story really pays off with the powerful emphasis on coopertative puzzle solving. I'd caution new players to the Call of Strike: Global Warfare series, as the steep learning curve is somewhat of a disservice to the overall experience. However, if you can get over that curvature with ease, the experience opens up a lot of interesting rpg elements not typically seen in a third person shooter. If you're looking for a similar feel to the antiquated versions of this game but with more refined visuals, there's no reason to not pick this up. I give this real-time strategy visual novel a Snow White out of a Disney Princess.

fr4z;-;For someone who played Counter-Strike for years, Counter-Strike Global Offensive is the succesion of that legendary game. VALVe perfectly knew that people wanted the real gameplay of Counter-Strike, and they did it good in CS:GO. The gamemodes are awesome, especially the matchmaking. Overwatch is something revolutionary to avoid cheaters, but there are still some that are not respecting fair-play. I recommend CS:GO to every people who want to see what a real FPS is.
Carno00;-;You can get Karambits, Bayonets, Flip Knives, Gut Knives, Huntsman Knives and Butterfly Knives, but no Butter Knives... WTF?!? Great Game!!

Neocdark;-;This game is hardcore fps at its finest, playing more with your team gets you a bigger chance of winning and is of course more fun!
azerW;-;Amazing game, Valve have done an amazing job. I used to play 1.6 back in the day-zzz, as well as Source, before quitting for some odd reason that I don't remember. I recently bought CS:GO after seeing how popular it was getting on Steam, and instantly fell in love with it. More realistic gameplay than any other FPS that I've played.
[Cash.net] Tenndex;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive logic. Score: 0-10 "Everybody on the other team must be hacking!" Score: 10-0 "I AM THE LORD OF COUNTER STRIKE" And according to half of the community, they have hade sexual intercourse with my mother multiple times. 10/10
BadassFreeman;-;Before I start, I will admit, even if I once was a hardcore first person shooter player, I kind of got tired of them over the years. I had Counter Strike Source and Day of Defeat Source, but I pretty much only wanted them for Garry's Mod. The last CS I played for hours and hours was the 1.6 version of the original, and that was over 10 years ago. Now, after these Summer Sales, I saw CS:GO at 5. Looking at other "mainstream serious FPS" these days, like CoD and Battlefield, that usually go arround the 60-70, not counting the load of DLC's, it seems like the best deal ever! It actually is? The awnser is, yes. Oh man, I do still suck a bit at these games after playing nothing but TF2 for when it comes to FPS games, but I still had fun like the old days. The game is done to perfection. Guns work as intended, no stupid recoil like the recoil you see in other  FPS games, here it looks realistic, and it feels good. The maps are good as well, feel just like the originals, while the new ones add originality, and the ones made by the community are always amazing. The gameplay is smooth. Right now I'm using a  PC, since my old one kind of blew up (it probably could not handle my afro), and this piece of crap runs the game without that much issues on low-mid settings, while games like CoD Ghost or Hardline always bring dumb problems because of horrible optimization. I have like 30 hours so far with this game, and I bought it on the Summer Sales, that ended like a week or two ago. I have been in normal servers, filled with both new and old players, I have tried bots, and I have played 10 matchmaking games so far, and without counting the MM match where I ended with a bunch of Russian s who did nothing but to yell crap on their microphone, blame me, and then ragequit, I had nothing but fun. And that's another thing, the community is amazing. Some people might stay silent most of the time, but they won't get THAT mad, unless you really screw up something, or act 100%  (like dropping your gun at the start of the round, buying nothing, going 1 vs 5 with your knife, and then say that this game is a bad ripoff of Call of Duty. I have found one dude like that, and I think he was not trolling, but totally serious). And well, I did  up at times on my first matches, I wasn't used to the new buy menus, the changes of the maps, the new models, I find of teamkilled 2 friends so far, but they where not mad. Probably because they where new too, at some point, and know how it sucks to be THAT guy. The sale is over, and it doesn't cost 5 anymore. Still, the full price is like 12 or so, and if you really like competitive and serious multiplayer FPS action, this is your game, doesn't matter if you're a filthy casual, a nooblord, or the classic "MLG" that will probably kill the other team in 30 seconds with 5 bullets, all headshots. Oh, and while the weapons feel balanced, I got to say that the shotguns are really underrated. Further more, I f#cking love them. It might be because I'm an old-school Unreal Tournament player (I have been in tournaments, and ), and my favorite weapons from that game was the Flak Cannon, but I find it fairly easy to kill scrubs who tryhard with M4's and AK's with 1 or 2 shoots to the face, while they crouch and spray their bullets all over Mordor. Give them a try if you're new, you won't regret it. If you don't believe it, look at the screenshoot below, at the end. I played nothing but classic pistol rounds and Nova the whole game, and I ended up with 43-18, being the MVP of the match. And I'm not that good, you can probably do it way better than me! Besides, killing 1 player with the Nova gives like 900$, while weapons like the AWP (best Sniper Rifle) only give 100$. What's not to like? And if in the end you find the game boring, just idle on servers. With time, you will get drops and items that you can easily sell in the market. With some time, you will get your money back. I have gotten 2 so far, just with the new crates, so... http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=281036740

MWC;-;Many years ago I was drafted for this war. I was in the most deadly battle you could think of. I had lost all hope of survival and my team was loseing left and right. Then in my darkest hour I saw something that inspired me to keep fighting. It was single chicken that ran by and then I was inspired to fight for my freedom and I died but then I came back into the world. I think the reason was because I had not completed what I had started, I had not shown honor to the chicken yet, but then I saw a group of chickens and thats when I saw the holy chicken the one that I had saw in my time of darkness and I talked to it and became friends with thy chicken. Soon 2 enemys saw me I was traped with no escape I only managed to kill one of them and thats when the other shot but then out of no where the holy chicken flew down and sacrificed his life so that I had time to kill the other and survive. I still think of this chicken today and how he could have left me to die...but he didnt. he sacrificed himself for me as I think of him I shed a single tear and remember the fun times we had. How on that day he changed my life and inspired me that there is still hope in this dark world. How things can get better. From that day I said to myself I will keep fighting, that I will make sure that his death was not in vain and to honor all chickens not just him! You can honor the holy chicken to. All you have to do is purchase this game and fight for the chicken and for what is right! 10/10 Would honor the chicken again.
h;-;I don't know what it is but CS:GO just never gets boring for me. I can play it for 20 hours straight, and I'll be loving every second of it. 440+ hrs on record in a 3 month duration and still loving it. Unlike Call of duty & Battlefield, this tactical FPS game is very unpredictable and gets hard on every rank level. I can say CS:GO is one of myaaa... you know, It's a style thing. Never liked the aug / galil so much till now. Ehh & inferno, mirage, nuke, dust and cache are all good maps. Don't queue on d2. The review has been brought to you by the honest and trustworthy Steam user "Shadys" http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadys
LEO #Ya 7obe;-;good in this game is the high quality and performance in the picture about what we know already in the previous sections Of the game depends of the best known FPS games, tactically for an excellent game.
BOT Cake;-;Counter-Strike is one of the biggest names in the PC gaming community, and for good reason: it revolutionized multiplayer FPS games. After the original CS hit shelves, along with 1.6 and Source, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has set the bar even higher, and jumped over it tenfold. Sticking close to it's roots, Global Offensive employs it's famous bomb defusal and hostage mission game modes (available in both "casual" and ranked 5v5 "competetive" types), along with integrating some other fun modes, such as arms race and deathmatch. Bomb and hostage scenarios are lead by a buying system, encouraging successful kills and objectives (like planting the bomb) to aid in buying gear in the next round. Players are required to use teamwork and tactics in order to come out on top against the enemy team, and winning a game gives a sense of satisfaction unlike any other first-person shooter game I've ever experienced. If you are expecting this game to be anything like Call of Duty or Battlefield, you will be sorely disappointed. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an excellent addition to the CS saga, and I strongly recommend picking it up and giving it a try.
MaGicK'z;-;This game destroyed my social life and im fluent in russian now. 10/10 (   )
Cerberus;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive is not just your ordinary first person shooter, it is an action packed addictive game which you can sit down and play for hours without getting bored. With many mods, game modes and very competitive gameplay this game has it all. If you're looking for a casual first person shooter to play in your freetime or an all out competitive exciting game I would strongly recommend CS:GO. With its in-game voice chat you can play with your friends on any server and communicate easily without needing any other software. You can even host your own server with custom game modes and maps which can be built by you or anyone else, not only that but this game has a workshop in which you can post your creative weapon skin and map ideas which might be implemented permanently into the game! Once again, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who is an FPS enthusiast, or just a casual player.
kingkah;-;1.Open crate 2. Get nothing 3. Add funds. 4. repeat 5. Swim in blues.
Moose Knuckles;-;I recommend this game ONLY on certain parameters. If you're looking for a story, theres none I could find. There's pratically an economy on this game as in people will spend outrageous amounts of actual money on such as gun skins. It has....interesting shooting mechanics to say the least, not your standard shooter, but thats what makes it funner. Like shooting people in the face(ak only)? This is probably the game for you and probably already in your library somewhere.
deadman;-;Really nice game to play with freinds. you know it!
The Hidden;-;Don't get this game. If you want a life, don't get this game. CS:GO is consuming. Why? Because it's really the jack of all trades when it comes to gaming. Want to be competitive? This is the fiercest competition you'll ever find in the world of gaming. Want to have fun? Oh the minigames, jailbreak and surf servers are so consuming. Want to have a gamble*? Open some cases! *lose a lot of money for nothing Want to have a game based on skill? Look no further! However you play it, fast paced, slow paced, afking, its all there! WARNING : it probably says it in the T&Cs if you read it carefully but it doesn't cover for insurance if you flip your table when you unbox a knife and hurt yourself, nor does it care about your social life and grades. CS:GO is brutal.

Gigi;-;Not a big gamer - actually I probably don't classify as one at all XD but this is an awesome game with something for everyone. It never fails to entertain - definitely worth the money and I would recommend it to everyone :)
#The_T1mon;-;A truly outstanding game by VALVE, which everyone has heard of. The temple and the progenitor of all shooters. Game of childhood. Does one need to say more? The remake was more than successful. All his hopes, he fully justified. Graphics and the gameplay has changed significantly. New weapons and maps, nice paint nostalgic memories. If you're a fan of the series CS, feel free to take this game. Constantly updated workshop stirs interest. The game is still alive. The last of the legendary family 9 chickens out of 10
Tuco Salamanca;-;Great game! If you love playing FPS game then this one is something you should have.. Whether you're looking to play casually for fun or want to be competitive ... this game is the one for you.. Great price at $15 and no bs "premium" to unlock 80% of the game.....
Lt. Eddy;-;+Lots of reaction time and skill based gameplay +Constant updates to 'Team-Sided' maps +Skins and Workshop support -VAC misses a lot of cheaters through the loopholes -Doesn't have same competitive rules as Dota 2, making it feel dated -Keys and Drops are the Devil

Dali Llama;-;10/10 Good Graphics. Good Registry. Bad Lag. Bad Team mates. Smurfing has totaly screwed up MM. If I go alone, either get against a smurf, hacker, or have a mentally challenged team. I've lost a game with over 50 frags. Other then that, the trolls, and general rude people that you'll occasionally meet on any game, It's a good game overall. Overwatch is fun, and helps the community. Would buy again. You should buy this. And some skins from the market. and keys. And some more items.. GG VALVE.
Hemzok (  );-;Best cs ever so far, thanks to the Match Making system, and epic skins. Competitive mode finally brings possibility to play the game in the way how it always should have been played, without necessity of finding 9 people to play so called "MIX". The rank system finds a valid opponent for everyone, whether You are newb, or cspro You will have be matched against opponents at Your skill level, and comparing to other games with similar MM systems, this one in CS really works well, after like 100 games, 30 round game happens very often. The only thing I would like to see in game is 5v5 casual mode with rules like in competetive(so I could still play with my friends, who are banned for disconnecting).

Jesus;-;This is an awesome first person shooter, where you must master both movement, and accuracy. The spray patterns are very unique in the Counter Strike series, and I find that this version of Counter Strike is quite enjoyable. I highly recommend checking this game out if you do not already own it! GG no RE, Enough Said!
EndeV;-;CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.
Azalroth;-;If you like FPS game this is for you,but there is some people who might call you hacker,noob,***hole and other nice words :) But that aint worst part!

METTER;-;CS:GO may seem too familiar to those who have played Source. Source felt a bit wishy-washy, with no official modes and servers. CS:GO is not only well-organised but more catering to less experienced players whilst still retaining the essence of what makes counter-strike a proffessional gamer's shooter. New weapons may seem more like reskins but I prefer the simplicity of having no silencers and the properly working stats and decent achievements right from the game's release as oppose to an update 5 years after the game's release or something. Global Offensive's graphics aren't vastly different, but it is certainly the best looking shooter on the Source engine to date, and doesn't look as outdated as it should do for a 2004 game engine. The game seems well balanced, snipers are impressive, the Scout/SSG is no longer terrible and genuinely viable in competitive matches. Blur is added to sniper scopes while moving to balance them too. WWeapons do seem balanced and people use more than just AK, MR, Deagle and AWP. The 4 game modes - Casual Competitive, Classic Competitive, Demolition and Arms Race means there's something for everyone. Sure there's no Capture the Flag but in a game where there's no sprinting, health regen, killstreaks, aim down sights or ability to revive or heal teammates, it's probably for the best. Gun game is finally officially supported, and Demolition simplifies the game by removing the need to buy weapons. I've always wanted to try counter-strike properly but Source was just far too disorganised and had other distractions. Global Offensive brings the classic game into a modern setting without falling into the trap of being a Call of Duty clone. It's still counter-strike, with exactly the same gameplay mechanics as the original, but presented in a more appealing and fun package. It certainly feels more welcoming for newcomers than Source, which is a big plus not only for competitive gaming but for the franchise as a whole. The only thing lacking is Team Deathmatch, however this would require a "Create a Class" which would turn it into CoD. Arms Race fills that spot, and Demolition combines Classic CS with Gun Game. The primary reason why this game is more accomodating is because it was meant to be a port of Source to Xbox LIVE, so obviously some things needed to be changed or added to broaden its appeal. And for the most part, Valve have done a great job. Matchmaking is efficient, bots for offline play are exclellent with decent AI programming rather than the predictably linear Source AI and the package as whole is much more modern as oppose to Source, where it was a case of "too little, too late" when they decided to update it. If you haven't played CS before and want to give it a go, this is the best game. Equally if you are a seasoned Veteran it might make for a refereshing start if you are looking to get back into it.

Shade;-;Worst video game ever! I shall only play it for another 1000hours.
Tehh3;-;Spent most of my weekends playing this, wasted all my money on skins, constantly got banned for 7 days for leaving matches. 10/10 ruined my life.
Terres;-;CS:GO is one of my favorites and it's one of the best FPS games, the first FPS I ever played was CS 1.6! Just go for the head shots and be patient you will be rewarded. 10/10
Cono OG;-;Great FPS! The gun skins just make this game 99.732% better
TooManyBytes;-;Played with a full russian team 10/10
chedda;-;This game ing sucks, all P2W. If you want a game that is free and doesn't cost anything play something like Dota 2 or Skyrim.
Br[A]wl;-;You must have this game. Very good!
kreeg;-;Way too balanced. Needs aim assist to help me feel pro, and the balance is so harsh- the game needs overpowered secondaries, needs pointless deathstreaks, needs OP killstreaks, and most importantly, stop making changes in the new versions of the games, but need to put more polygons. Stop putting in good maps by fans, put in terrible maps that looks like circles. Stop helping the community, make the game pay-to-win and put hats in it. lol If what you pay for is what you get, all the other first person shooters are overpriced. For 15$ you get a legendary game, for 60$ you get more polygons.
Albatrss;-;Bad hit reg Awful servers Always stuck with teams that dont speak English Rage inducing 4/20, would noscope blaze it.
'iParanormal;-;Where to start... CS is very diverse in the array of gametypes it provides, in the people that play it, and in the communities those people have created. Communities and creative individuals of those communities have invented a wide vareity of very innovative gametypes. Different gametypes, from any other game, like surfing; where each player must slide down large slopes to gather momentum to launch themselves over large gaps in the slopes - if you don't have enough speed; you fall, die and restart. The speed and intense feeling of gaining that momentum is an entirely amazing concept alone. There's also Jailbreak; where the Terrorists are in jail cells and the Counter-Terrorists are the jail security guards and one Counter-Terrorist is picked as the warden. The warden will use their voice to issue commands to the Terrorists in specifically-made maps that contain minigames like a jumping obstacle course, bomb dodging arena, surfing course, and in one map I even saw a skeet-shooting arena where the skeet were the Terrorists hahahaha. If the terrorists are found betraying what the warden says the security team has rights to terminte that inmate which makes for an amazing level of deception as a Terrorist and a sense of mystery and hunting as a jail security guard. These clever vareity of gametypes are only the tip of the iceberg as there are many servers with mods such as Warcraft; where players gain EXP to purchase skills and upgrades that give abilities such as a grapeling hook, a power jump, or temporary invisibility. While all the different gametypes are perfect for casual time spent playing and socializing with the hundreds of thousands of players constantly playing this game; i've yet to mention the competitive side which is by far the stake-in-the-ground of CS's long-lasting playability. The professional scene, while it IS great, is not my primary description of 'competitive side'; the competitive side is more the general philosophy that, if a player is willing, they can nearly ALWAYS improve upon themselves. There are fundamentals in this game that once learned you can build upon by yourself, with friends, or with an entire community to create quality and constructive gameplay for thousands of hours. This philosophy alone is the groundwork for the seemingly endless vareity of topics any player can choose to constructively upon build their skills. Here are a few examples of different things in the game that contribute to its learnability: Game-sense: The sense you get when you don't see an enemy and you can determine where they are based on where they are not. Game-sense also runs deep with the strategic and competitive de_, or Demolition, style gametypes which are round-based (meaning when you die you're dead until the end of the round). In demolition there are 2 bombsites that the Terrorists have to choose from, and the CTs must guard both until they get a feeling of which bomb site the Ts have chosen. Once they depict which way the Ts are heading the CTs must 'rotate', or re-route their attention, through the map to the other bombsite. This 'rotation' creates predictable motions from either team and you can learn to expect certain actions and invent creative ways to approach the bomb sites. This style of gameplay greatly contributes to the total capacity of the game-sense CS instills. Gun spray control: Unlike most shooters each gun in CS has a "pattern" that a spray of bullets from each gun has. Most shooters have an algorithim that seemingly randomizes sprays but CS has a LEARNABLE and CONTROLLABLE spray. There are many other variables such as movement speed, crouched status, and spray speed that factor into it but overall spray patterns are discoverable through experience and experimentation which can greatly contribute to how powerful the weapons can seem at different levels of awareness of these variables. Map strategy: CS has a wide vareity of maps. In some, close-quarter and in-the-moment reaction is needed and in others much more planning and teamwork is required to prevail. Also some maps, as mentioned, are game-type specific so depending on what you're looking for out of CS you can browse community servers to find it or que up in competitive matchmaking and only play the maps you want.There are also many tricks in each map such as jumps, grenade bounces, houses or buildings you can throw grenades over to position them strategically. All of these aspects greatly contribute to the philosophy of self-growth and trying to make yourself a better player regardless of what people you play with, what gametype you play, or if you even decide play competitive matchmaking. Its all up to you and this game can provide you that great sense of progression and growth that I've not found in a video game in a long, long time.
n1kQ  * B34$T;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games i just wanna play all the time. This game is really good. The graphics are good, the gameplay are fun and the game modes are fantastic. I have been spending so much time on this wonderful game mode Competitive. Competitive is a mode where two teams are fighting against each other and the first team that wins 16 rounds win the match. You can play this game with your friends, you can play this game with yourself and you can play this game with strangers. I really don't get tired of this game, it keeps my mood up and if i don't know what to play i start CS:GO. If you don't already own this game you should be a shame because this is a MUST own. All in all you won't regret that you bought this game if you like FPS games, the CS series and games made by Valve. And here comes the best thing - Skins. You can buy several skins for your favorite guns. There is alot of skins + You get drops every week. These skins can be bought from the Community Market! Another review by Niko Bellic! (Written by myself) 10/10
LORD RAGNOS1997;-;Overal rating: 10/10 Good: +Gameplay mechanics +Graphics are quiet good +Feels little bit like Modern Warfare 2 +Camos +Awesome maps +EPIC comebacks from 14-1 to 14-14 in no time if you communicate +Suka blyat is not, but karma is a "bich", so does KURVVA Bad: -Servers are unstable sometimes -Radiculous BAN systems, if I get a BAN its automatically 7 days if someone else gets its simple as that only 30 minutes - ULTIMATE RAGE AFTER THAT Conclusion: This is an ultimate RAGE MACHINE, if you ever played this you know what I'm talking about.
kingkah;-;1.Open crate 2. Get nothing 3. Add funds. 4. repeat 5. Swim in blues.
Moose Knuckles;-;I recommend this game ONLY on certain parameters. If you're looking for a story, theres none I could find. There's pratically an economy on this game as in people will spend outrageous amounts of actual money on such as gun skins. It has....interesting shooting mechanics to say the least, not your standard shooter, but thats what makes it funner. Like shooting people in the face(ak only)? This is probably the game for you and probably already in your library somewhere.
Eydis Fire-Eye;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, aka "The Hate Machine", or also known as "Aortic Aneurysm Simulator 2012" is best described as a slow, steady descent into a blind, black-out madness fueled entirely by your desire to see your virtual rank increase. It is guaranteed that at the very least, 60% of your time spent playing this game will be comprised of spectating your 14 year old Russian non-English speaking teammates continually fling themselves into an Auto-Rifle oblivion barrage and blame you in their foul Slavic tongues for their resulting deaths.
Taylor Swift;-;For those of you who're new to the Counter Strike series, this game has been around longer then any Battlefield or Call of Duty game. Most commonly known to now as CS:GO, this game has been around since 2012 and the previous one, Counter Strike: Source since 2004. Counter Strike Global Offensive features a sufficient amount of gamemodes such as Demolition, Hostage and Defuse missions which actually require teamwork and co-orindation to win. CS:GO has its very own competitive play system which you're placed into a 5v5 match of people the same skill level as you (which is determined by your ranking on official VAC Secured servers) to fight it out on a gamemode and map of your choice. This game isn't for people who like to give up easily, it required skill in knowing the maps, how to handle recoil and working as a team to achieve victory. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a challenge in FPS shooters.
BIG Seven;-;GOING TO UNINSTALL THIS THANG!

Dr.Nipples;-;killed someone at the start of the round for fun, got banned 7 days best game eber
Stainless;-;I play CS:GO since Januar 2014 and it's one of the best Counter Strike's made. I played nearly 5 years CS:S and it was hard to get into the new CS but its worth. Pretty good game :)
jAp;-;A great FPS 10/10 should play
Glockalisk /r/RandomActsofCSGO;-;If you're of a competitive nature this game could very well ruin your life. If you love seeking tiny arbitrage opportunities in an entirely demand driven totally off the wall market, this game could very well ruin your life. If you're sick of  flashy shooters, and actually want to be considered good at a shooter that's universally accepted to be very difficult and have one of the highest learning curves... this game will definitely ruin your life. If you think "I USED TO BE LIKE BASICALLY PRO CS1.2 IMMA ROCK THIS GAME OFC" you should uninstall. Totally different game, . My opinion? Two thumbs up, ruined my life.
Nerd.;-;Fun, competitive but can be difficult to learn without help
XMK;-;Nice game, great continue of CS
Diplo Mclovinbam GoufBam;-;I think if this game wasnt so skin sided i think id be able to look at my shoes in the game more than look at my knife, 10/10 would buy 1k knife skins again.
rob-wiz twitch.tv/robwiztv;-;great game, love to play it all the time, my parents have an issue with how much im playing this! haha
SoulStriker;-;Has sucked more time out of me then id like to admit, but it's a blast to play. Worth well over the $15 price tag
trk #plsgibtradingcards;-;For only 10.99 Euros, go play competetive matchmaking with: 1. Terible raging russians, who apparently ed your mom 2. 11 year old kids, screaming and crying on the mic 3. Swedish trolls who will  your day so hard youll want to just roll into a ball and cry for the rest of the day 4. Complete noobs in medium/high ranks, about whom youll question yourself how did they got that rank Also rage some more when the  64 tick valve servers decide that that headshot on a still standing player is actually a miss. Get into the exciting action of unboxing crates, as you spend tons of money hoping to get a rare knife, or a nice skin, when all you get are  blue skins which cost 3 cents each. Although great game, 10/10
Xenzorg;-;Probably the best competetive shooter out there. Incredibly fun and challenging in the same time + it's cheap. Graphics could be better but at least it should work on every machine. Even on a potato. ;) -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *Gameplay 10/10 *Sound 9/10 *Graphics 7/10 Overall score 9,5/10 MUST BUY!
06.06.2006;-;this , every third game you are matched vs obvious cheater. By obvious I mean someone who's following people through walls, prefires, clearly knows where everyone is etc Pros are being caught cheating. Cheaters are everywhere in this game. Added 1/28/2015 Tried again after a month. Encountered cheater in third game. Again I'm talking about guy who's clearly a cheater: prefires, doesn't checks places where no one is, gets insane shots all the time etc Also hitboxes are messed up. It's not just me as well, it's a known fact. You will miss shots you should've get and vice versa. Ladder climbing, jumping, peeking etc all is messed up. [VOLVO DO SOMETHING PLS!11]

Wisecrack;-;In Counter-Strike:GO you play as Tom Clancy's younger brother; Al Clancy. Growing up Tom gave Al a hard time ruffling his hair and calling him names such as "weird Al" Barbara and John Clancy brought up these two whiper snappers in the state of ohio in the USA. They were a middle class family. When Al turned 7 his mum and dad bought him a pair of Night Vision goggles for Christmas. Tom being the the young nipper scallion he was decided it was a good idea to steal these as they were proper flipping oreyt. The sense of achievment Tom got when he stole these glasses was second to none, it didnt take long for tom to get addicted to ruining christmas. (fun fact, the grinch is loosely based on this story.) As they grew older it became clear that all tom and his football friends wanted to do was ruin christmas, They called themselves Christerrorists. This new movement led to the boys seeing a darker side of themselves, they began finding care packages santa had dropped for deprived children and strapping C4 on them. The ultimate way to ruin Christmas. Al was enraged when he became aware of this, he did the only thing a right wing father of 3 christmas loving American could do in this situation... Bought a metric sh**t tonne of guns and grenades. He began handing these out to friends and neighboors on his cul de sac. They soon became The Count Christerroists. The game is purely story mode. With this special addition you play as both Christerroists and Counter Christerrorists, in a sort of heads to head. (!!!!!!!!spoilers the story gets a little confusing as it is mainly about how many quick scopes you can do with the AWP and standing at Mid With bomb while your team clear a plant site and then losing the game) I dont want to give too much away so I will leave this review here, I hope you found it helpful. I would rate this game a 7/10 it could get a 9 but due to it being a christmas game I can only play around the festive time of year otherwise it seems a little silly. Like when you here Fairy Tale of new york by the pogues in august. It just doesnt feel right.
JS;-;Very unforgiving towards new players however, after you've done your time, learned the game and mechanics, very few games feel more exciting and rewarding than cs. If you're into competitive games and shooters you need to have this game.
[GIRL] Alyssa <3;-;stop hacking
Dasha;-;The perfect balance between ultimate joy and wishing you've never installed it. I'm talking about Counter Strike: Global Offensive, or short: CS:GO. A first person shooter with a way better community than COD (and believe me, I've played COD2 in the past and that's one of the better games made). You may not receive constructive feedback on your plays, but at least none of the players have had intercourse with your mother. The game has different types of game modes, maps, weapons and skins. You can play it either single or multiplayer; what more can a person wish for. 9/10 Definitely worth if you: - Enjoy FPS games. - Like stabbing people in the back. - Are a competitive person. Skip the game if you: - Can't handle working as a team. - Rage easily. - Basically only contribute in a negative way.
Shockblack;-;WHO ARE THOSE IDIOT 5% WHO DONT LIKE THE GAME?!?! CS GO is the best game in the world! It is so strategy based, unlike other fps games, even though individual skill is needed. And even right when you start, you can play casual which is tons of fun with great people. I don't know why you wouldn't get this game. Edit: Take it from someone with 1000+ hours ;)
awakeDx;-;The Best Game <3

RadicalPoison-ECHO;-;REVIEW FOR CS GO(ALSO KNOWN AS DUST 2 GO) This is the breakdown of how people feel about the game based on their hours: 0-40 min: Holy  dude, this game is hard, everyone is killing me, im gonna quit...cod for life about 2 hours: Wow dude, i actually got a kill! IM gonna play more and see what happens 5 hours:The P90 and auto are so good man, everything else is useless 20 hours: FK the P90, ive started getting kills with the awp 35 hours: O  im silver 1 im so good 35.01 hours: Silver 1 is the first rank you can get...oh..... 100 hours: Ive mastered some guns and im ready to get out of silver 200 hours: I still cant get out of silver 250 hours: Im out of silver, my life is complete 1000 hours: Im 360 no scoping noobs with the awp,  new players 10/10 Best game ever...
White Noise;-;* buys game for $3.74 * * sells a few items and gets about $4.00 * Totally worth it.
Vinex;-;Needs more chickens.
Gilthunder;-;This game is one of the most amazing games ever created. You will find yourself losing hours in this game whether it be happily or with a frustrated tone. The game itself is relatively simple; you plants bombs or you try to stop others from doing so. The vast amount of guns helps keep the game interesting(don't use auto snipers in competitive...just don't). Also all guns have alternate skins for the gun so collecting those can be fun to do, but you may end up spending hundreds of dollars on keys and cases, so in my opinion just buying the skin outright is cheaper than opening tons of cases to look for one you want. Overall the game will frustrate you, and please you all in the same hour and you'll always return to it so you should get this game.
Euphoria. *Bad-Dragon.com;-;If you love to chase chickens around and slash them with an overly-expensive virtual knife that serves no real purpose other then looking cool, then this is the game for you! Oh yeah, you also gotta shoot people. But that is besides the point.
CytriX-Ghost;-;This game taught me to analyze graphs and numbers better than my school did 10/10
The Terminator;-;Great competitive game.
Rubio;-;1/10 3/6 of my last games had cheaters in them. Nice! (1 point for chickens)
Atone;-;Warning, highly addictive! Great game to play with your friends and if you don't have any you can find some while playing! It requires both skill and good tactics to win the match and as a team game CS:GO is one of the best ever created. Most people tend to think that it's all about shooting enemies but it's more than that. The aiming itself is difficult and you will have to control the recoil by moving the mouse in the opposite direction as the gun is going so learning to aim well is crucial to be successful in the game. But you will also have to learn grenade spots, and be able to read your opponents mind and know where they will be and what they will do next. Once you get to know the basics, go ahead and create your own team and compete in online ladders and tournaments or if it feels too difficult, serious or anything just play matchmaking and have fun killing your opponents. Learning to play at a decent level will take lots of practice and I'm talking about hundreds to thousands of hours. But in CS:GO you don't have to get destroyed by the better players because of its matchmaking system, which is great for new players. It places you in a match with players of the same skill as you, even if you had just bought the game (yeah you will still have to play a few placement matches against [probably] better players before so have fun with that). And to enjoy the game you don't even have to take it so seriously as community servers offer plenty of fun gamemodes such as kz, surfing, bhop etc. that are really fun to spend your time on. So with that price tag you shouldn't be reading this review anymore and just buy this game. Trust me, it's worth it.

Tora the Tiger;-;CS:GO is a very fun game to play with your friends. Competitive shows teamwork a lot more than any other game, and also the feeling of accomplishment when you get kills are fantastic. I strongly recommend this game if you are deciding whether you should get it or not.
twitch.tv/mlgmaintain #live;-;this game makes me hap
Itz_;-;It's time for me to write my review of this game's gameplay ONLY after playing it for almost 800 Hours Note: I won't be writing about the skin , drop system. I will be only writing about the gameplay. I can't type perfect English so excuse me on that. Firstly , Counter Strike Global Offensive is a game which will require individual skill , teamwork and good communication. When , I started playing Counter Strike Global Offensive , I was a guy who always like to do things solo and not give a crap about my teammates. I would just not listen to my team and just do whatever I want. Once I started learning more about Counter Strike Global Offensive , I started to reliease that this game will require patience as you need time to get better at your individual skill and not to get angry at your team if they are not following to your calls. Secondly , Counter Strike Global Offensive has a handful of cheaters. Be physically and mentality prepared if you face a cheater on the enemy team. Don't start to rage as your mood will affect your gameplay , just play the game like there is no cheaters at all in that particular match. Thirdly , I will recommend this game to people who wants to get better at FPS games as this game will help you in your individual skill and teamwork. You will also make more friends and you end up playing every competitive match with them. I give this game a 8/10 rating. "Why not 10/10?" , you might be asking. There is many cheaters on the loose and they not have been banned , that is the reason why I don't give this game a 10/10. Finally , Good Luck and Have Fun if your planning to start playing this game. Hope this review has helped you if your planning to buy Counter Strike Global Offensive. If you have any questions , feel free to write down in the comment section and I will get back to you ASAP :) DistinguishedMasterGuardian Itz_v
M00N #Back 20th August;-;At first I was thinking that I will play all games but CS:GO infected me because it is the most competitive game in the world. My Counter-Strike 1.6 career is over after 7 years because of this game. I hope I will achieve in CS:GO as in Counter-Strike 1.6. Valve knows what they are doing and they do it really good and that is causing addiction to the games, i got addicted to 1.6 and I am addicted to Global Offensive now. Nice game and I love it. 10/10
jonttuWE;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive expands upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered with Half-Life: Counter-Strike. CS: GO features new maps, characters, and weapons, and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content. In addition, CS: GO introduces new gameplay modes, matchmaking, leader boards, and more. I love this game! 10/10!

sarCASTIc;-;In the beginning I did not like this game, coming from CSS. However, over time, I have come to enjoy it more than CSS, mainly due to the continued updates to the game and Matchmaking service. Also there seems to be a lot of support for it from developers and the communitiy. All in all, if you like Counter Strike or in general any tactical FPS, then this is a game you must buy. Genuinely 10/10, would recommend.

[WB] Toasty;-;CS:Go certainly is a hard game to master, so if you answer yes to any of these following questions: -You like the shooting system of Call of Duty -You like to stay in cover and recover health -You love games that are P2W Then I'd not recommend this to you, since CS:Go is the exact opposite of that. There is recoil, and tapping doesn't make it easier (with some exceptions, that is). Like many FPS games, CS:Go has a system which indicates your health. There are no weapons you can buy, you can only buy weapon skins on the steam marketplace, these skins do not add anything apart from the skin itself. TL;DR: It's a good FPS game, definitely worth the 14 euros.

Revan The Bleeding Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

Zoma * Kinguin;-;I've determined that Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is from another dimension. It's a game that doesn't need to exist. PC gamers are perfectly served by Counter-Strike: Source and CS 1.6 , content with the decade-something of tuning and attention those games have received. But here's GO: full of doppelganger Desert Eagles and de_dust deja vu, quantum-leaping from some parallel timeline whose game industry briefly intersected with ours. Playing it is like running into a college crush at the supermarket. You immediately notice differences. Oh, you're married? Your hair looks different. But that experience of reconnecting is pleasantthey're mostly still the person you admired during geology. In other words, GO's familiarity helps and hurts. Minor deviations from the CS you might've known or loved are easy to identify. The MP5 is now the MP7, but it lacks the same clicky report and underdoggy this is all I can afford, please don't kill me personality. The TMP is replaced by the MP9. Ragdoll physics don't persist after death, curiously. You can't attach a suppressor to the M4 for some reason. I'm not particularly bothered by this stuff; I don't need the MP5 reproduced precisely as it existed in 2006 or 2009 to live a fulfilling life. What does bug me are some small but significant changes to firing feedback. When you shoot someone in GO, they don't wince. There's a sneeze of blood, and audio that conveys that you're hitting them if you're within a certain range. But they don't do this , and I don't understand the decision to omit a flinch animation on character models. Especially at long range, it takes a little more effort and squinting than it should to tell if I'm hitting someone or not. And counterintuitively, bullet tracers, new in this version of CS, are an unreliable source of feedback. They seem to trail the path of your actual bullet by a few microseconds. With rifles and SMGs, my eyes would wander away from my enemy and crosshairs "what I should be watching" and try to interpret where my bullets were falling based on the slightly-delayed, streaky particle effects. The small upside to tracers is that they mitigate camping a bit.

Seraphis;-;CG:GO is a blast to the past; a nod to the old-school days of the late 90's, and it's more than welcome in my gaming livery. Whilst I love COD and Titanfall, there's something uniquely compelling about starting up a match of CS:GO, with it's deliberate and stayed pacing, and it's risk vs reward gameplay mechanics, it's no wonder this game has taken off for the 3rd time in it's lifecycle. It's popular right now for a reason, and that reason is good. A must-buy.
-Wr-;-;This is game is Super Recommmended FPS!
Abraxas <aimware.net>;-;This game was made by War Veterans and Arma 3 Tryhards. If you're willing to spend a long, long, long time trying to get good at a FPS game when you could be doing more productive things with your life, then this is the game for you. Have fun playing 40 hours of offline bot matches to actually not suck at this game. When you're done with your bot matches, you'll realise just how useless that preparation time actually has been for you, when someone headshots you through a wall with a ak-47 and then goes on to kill the other 4 members of your team. This game also has the best matchmaking system, ensuring that you are always on a team of Noobs, Trolls and other ers, and the enemy team are all Smurfs. Be ready to be kicked by your teammates for carrying them and giving them helpful, non abusive game advice because Counter-Strike has the best community full of rich 9 year olds that found their Mother's credit card and bought knives and other completely unnecessary in game items that make them play 'better'. Well at least the community isn't as bad as Dota or LOL. Placed in the Silver ranks after your first ten games? Well then you're ed and no one can help you. CS:GO is for people who haven't played a COD game and are willing to devote their lives to a realistic gun game when they could just be doing something else like cooking or sports. 7/10

iNsomnia;-;Consider purchasing this game if you like to experience at least one of the following points: - getting killed everytime without standing a chance because there is a smurf on the enemy team once again - being insulted because you suck, you use the P90, or because you are better than them; basically everyone hates you - being in a financial crisis because you are addicted to opening cases so your weapon looks a bit cooler - getting friend invites from scammers because you're lucky enough to get your hands on a knife - losing ranked games due to some idiots shooting at team mates for the sole purpose of getting kicked If these points sound appealing to you, I can recommend you to buy CS:GO. There's nothing better than wrecking havoc with your friends and have quick round of total domination against those filthy casuals, am I right? You even learn Russian from the kids screaming at you because you suck, so what are you waiting for?

DragonLore;-;Applying Multiverse theory, every Round that takes place in CS:GO is actually happening in different Universes thats why the Bomb Code never changes. But there is a lot universes where the bomb code is different, but we're just focusing on the ones with these Bomb Codes. Every time you play a different Round, you're entering a differnt Universe, and some Crazy whacko is keeping the score.

lmnl;-;Introduction: Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a multiplayer FPS game where you are either part of a Terrorist organisation or part of a team of Counter-Terrorists. The aim of the game is to work together with your team to defeat the opposing force. Even with many new maps, weapons and features, this game still has some classic maps and guns from the older Counter Strike games. Pros: -Over 20 different weapons to choose from. -Many game modes including casual, death match, arms race, competitive and more. -Unique skins and possible drops at the end of each match. -Operations that feature new community-made maps and skins. Cons: -Trolls, hackers and smurfs can ruin a competitive match. -In general, the game does not have a very friendly/kind community. -Some in-game items/features can be quite costly. -Competitive bans may last as long as a week. Overall: CS:GO can be addictive at times and is a lot more fun when playing with friends. The graphics are nice and I personally enjoy the music/sounds. Communicating and working well with your team can be a huge advantage to the game, but there are those who prefer to stray away from the rest of their teammates and play by their own rules. My rating would be an 8.5/10.
Finch;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Truly the best FPS I've ever played. As The War Owl put it, CS:GO is a marriage of teamwork, strategy and skill and that is the utmost truth. This is a game that leaves you wanting to do better, to learn and to grow in your own skill as a player. If you put in enough time into this game, I guarantee you won't regret it.

buddhapest;-;i played CS back in the beta days all the way through when it went source, including a bit of competitive. totally dig this game and CS:GO is actually a very nice combination of all the things that were good from all the various iterations of the game's history (purists,  off) the problem for me is the community - i've found that the only way to enjoy the casual game is to turn off all voice chat (mute EVERYONE). the game seems to draw some of the most vile hate filled bitter gamers i've ever dealt with. perhaps it's the lack of humour in the game. tf2 has its share of racists and mysogynistic wingnuts but the levity of tf2 draws a incredibly varied set of people that more than offset the bitter element. cs:go, on the other hand, has no such levity, and unless you play with your friends (whom you probably made in tf2) or are a hate filled bitter racist mysogynistic wingnut yourself, you're likely to be turned off. TL;DR? it's still a great game, as long as you don't let the bitter scum get to you. NOTE: competitive mode in cs:go is a different story. the wingnuts seem to stay in casual or are at least more focused in competitive

~ Antiblique ~;-;Whether you are a Counter Strike Legend or a typical new FPS player looking for a fun shooter, everyone should enjoy Counter Strike: Global Offensive. CS:GO is simply an updated, modern game on the Counter Strike series, with outstanding graphics, a variety of weapons, a list of game modes and amazing competitive aspects. This game proves who are the good Counter Strike players, and who are the best. CS:GO, of course, runs on the source engine, giving a smoother experience among lower end CPUs, highly benefiting more Counter Strike players coming from "1.6" or "Source". Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a very solid game which can either be enjoyed casually, or competitively. My reccommendation of this game is very high, as Counter Strike is simply....the best FPS on PC, no doubt.

Wollef.;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive is probably one of the best FPS games I have ever played. Not only are the graphics of the old maps polished but also the combat. There is a great range of playing style to suit you, such as rushing in with an SMG or sitting at the back with an AWP, which accommodate you to your best ability. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Another good part of this game is that the teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short so there's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. If you are interested in a both challenging and exhilarating FPS then I recommend you buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive 9.5/10.
Latemanism;-;Great sequel for a great game, Counter-Strike: Source. Smooth gameplay with twisting battles in amazing graphics. What else can you want from a fps game?
Spectral Knight;-;Counter-Strike Global Offensive brings almost everything that CS 1.6 brought when it came out.Classic CS maps,weapons, better sound quality, better graphics and more came together to re-create the Counter-Strike 1.6 atmosphere.For me this game is good and is the best CS game played untill now by me...I need to be honest and say that I'm not a huge fan of the series but this one is really good!The high frequency of updates and why not cammos and in-game items will give a long life to this game just like Team Fortress 2.
VIVALAZZ;-;Never open cases!!! But the game is great. Advise.
Kore;-;As usual there isn't a promosing gameplay behind Counter Strike : Global Offensive. They hid all the bugs, hacks, mechanical issues, and conectivity problems behind and cheap  microtransaction system, in which they brainwash you to think that the problem with matchmaking, connection and overall gameplay is "Regular", and "Normal". If you were looking for a competitive experience where learning from your mistakes aids you, you really haven't found anything of the sort here. From direct hits, with visual blood splatter not registering, to lag hacks, this game has it all. You're gameplay will be as miserable as Modern Warfare 3's spawning was on release; pitiful and a bunch of drivel. Their matchmaking system is as broken as Michael Jackson's face is natural. You're being matched with people with far more experience than you, it's like their playing against bots. Your gameplay not only will be completely counterintuitive if you are not a regular in the FPS world but it will be shattered by the amount of regurgitation you call; the community. People with 5year Veteran Badges to hackers claiming they "Trickshotz plz, omg ur bad noob." Pros: Modern Warfare in a nutshell Cons: Counter Strike Source not only has better content, but the gameplay is far more superior. - Connectivity issues - Constant Hackers with almost no patches to fix the issue. ing hell, at least "Nexon" publishes patches to rid the hackers for a week or so. -Mechanical issues in this game are so dumbfoundingly common and ridiculous, you'd have a better chance of getting a headshot if you smashed your  on the keyboard. - Microtransactions do nothing but cover up the wrong. -The game is worth less than Counter Strike Source on sale at its current state. -The community is rambunctiously annoying, egotistical and flat out mentally challenged.

ImCindy ^_^;-;omg! I can't believe i have never played this before. To think all the years i have wasted play call of duty. A very good FPS is to pick up and play. The action is fast and there is always a game going. Picked this up on sale/ This is the best money i have spent on steam so far. I recommend this to anybody that wants some fast action or a extended session of First person action!

Moosician [VACation];-;After 250 hours of intense gameplay I learned the meaning of life. I play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive every day. I have not gone a day without Counter-Strike since I first bought it on the Steam store. However I do not like the gameplay of Counter-Strike in any way at all. The game itself is complete trash and was probably developed by the same people who made the first tentacle gang bang video but there is a golden egg among the pile of crap this game is. The chickens. I follow them with my default knife around Inferno, recording their every step with NVIDIA Shadowplay (batteries not included) and counting each individual chicken I spot and add it to THE LIST. The chickens are pretty, simple and flawless. They do not make my frame rate go down (I run CS:GO on the potato from Portal 2) unlike Skyrim's chickens and they explode if they are killed. I have only seen one chicken ever explode and that was in a competetive game in which xKittenfall, my rival, on the terrorist's team slaughtered one in front of my eyes with his Karambit Fade knife. I now suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and kill anyone who comes near my chickens. They are only for me. Do not harm my chickens. Anyone who even bats an eye at one of my precious birds will take an AWP headshot to the foot- be it friend or foe. I fear for the safety of these chickens. They are why I live. I was created by the Chicken God in order to protect the godlike chickens. Chickens are the meaning of life and if you attempt to argue with me I will shoot you until you're dead. Right in the foot. With a Glock-18 (ultra overpowered TBH). Do not mess with my chickens. And if you come across me in a session... Oh wait, you won't, because I swore off multiplayer after people killed the chickens. I only play in Bot Only sessions by myself and kick the bots, following the chickens around and hoping they do something new. I have studied the chickens so well I have memorized all of their spawnpoints on Inferno. There are 14 that spawn on the map and I am obsessed with them. Stay away from my chickens. (PART 2- THE 800 HOUR BENCHMARK) I whip around the corner and 1 tap flusha. The crowd goes wild with excitement. I just won the ESEA tournament for my new team Symbiotic. Confetti falls around me and LED lights illuminate the entire gaming stadium. I won one million dollars for the squad. I began screaming as my team carried me out of the stadium back to the gaming house. When night came I began to work on Source SDK, my life's new legacy. For a month I had been working on an ingame dream home that was secluded from the world and had no guns. It had a back yard exclusive to chickens and a statue in the living room dedicated to chickens. I smiled as I looked over the entire map and began adding more props and chickens to make the house more lively. I looked at each individual chicken to make sure t were on point and ready to be presented in the map. When I finally upload the map on the workshop people will be able to view my amazing home. It is on and island in the middle of the ocean with a home on it. The chickens are safe from all harms in the entire world. The map consists of three skyboxes; The house & island, compiling skybox & the easter egg skybox which can be teleported to through a secret trigger_teleport. In the secret skybox is a race track dedicated to bringing back func_vehicle 2012. Valve did not include func_vehicle (from Source) in CSGO and it angered many mapmakers. They could not make drivable cars in our beloved Counter-Strike? What a scumbag move. We need to bring back func_vehicle to the Counter-Strike series in order to improve our community as a whole. Can we do this? I love chickens and balance the life between competetive gameplay and chicken worshipping on a secluded island. Thank you for considering The Message by Nas.
Grim.;-;Killed a guy with Flashbang . (10/10)
UNREAL MaDMan;-;CSGO is one of the best games, because it doesn't consist only of shooting but also tactics.
Silverchaoz;-;i came from cod to try to play something else beside russian squeekers that i totally dont understand and germans who cant speak english. now i play competetive here and i met some nice kids who can talk normal in their mic without screaming and talking garbage langeauge. Remember, no russian! edit: there is no  teambalance in counter strike. competive... i always get dropped in the bad teams....
Smrt_NO2;-;At the momment the only competitive FPS game with some of the good implementetions when it comes to matchmaking and also playing with your friends. Has very steep learning curve when it comes to weapons ( recoil, spread etc.). I would reccomend this game unless you are anoyed by next few things i am about to mention. First and foremost, Russians. Very annoying, trying to communicate in their native language even if it not a international language. Words they use, blyet, sukha. Second problem, kids. Because of this game i decided i will NEVER have kids, they are god awful creatures if you give them PC-s and a bad headset. Tend to scream and curse, even when not provoked. Of course "block communication" is a viable option but then you exlude one of the biggest parts of this game out of it. Still i like the game and i think it would worth you a while to buy it and play it. Added on 2014.10.17 After so many hours, i have found a fundamental flaw with this game. It is called the "a cooldown period". What it does basically is punsihing you for leaving game, killing team mates or dealing damage to your team mates. Also if you lose connection you will be spanked by valve. Why is this a flawed system, well i will explain that with as few words as possible. First of all is noobnes level of the players i play with *silver. You may throw grenade and he might run into it and die, of course who gets punished, YOU. Again russians and how ly persistant they are. If you say B, you can almost guarantee he wil go on A screaming at the same time "SUKA, BLYET, OBAMA BAD". So eventually you are forced to kill him, take the bomb and plant. I wrote this review in hope to get some feedback because i play 2-3 matches and then back to 7 day period cooldown. I honestly hope to get some suggestions aty least, and i hope you will find this usefull.
Renoracer;-;Hey, i am just curious if anyone else does this. Every day when i take a shower, i like to turn the water super hot, hold my nuts in my hand and let the scalding hot water run over them. Lately my balls have been extremely itchy for some reason, so instead of itching them, i burn them with scalding hot water to relieve the itching and it is quite possibly the most amazing sensation i've ever felt in my life. It feels amazing and i'm doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. I just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else. As i've been doing this, the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working. I know it's weird but i'm telling you it feels incredible. I'm not saying other people should try it, but if you've got an itch, perhaps a better alternative is to burn them with scalding hot water. Posted: 19 April 2014

OH PREAZE;-;It's an okay game but there are quite a few things which are so wrong with it which make you miss CSS. (NEW) CS:GO likes to crash when loading in to games, especially competitive and now I have been issued an unfair ban of 24 hours for the game crashing which I could not prevent, The ban system is nice but why not at least make it ban people after the warm up because it could fill a slot. 1. Playing Casual you will most likely play the same map over and over which is boring since so many choose the same map. When you leave to find another you will find the same map. De Dust. It makes the game really boring and angry that everytime you leave for a new map you find the same map and even on that server everyone votes for it again. 2. Everyone is skin crazy and it is even worse than TF2 cosmetics. So many of the players of CS:GO seem to think having skins makes you better at the game. Those who do not own skins are looked down upon but most of the time do better than those with skins. I have a few skins myself (Brought 1 and found the rest) 3. The game is amazing and I love the guns but #1 makes you feel bored with the game. If you could vote for the map and the map you just played wasn't an option it would be fun and would make it less boring, ive decided to stop playing casual now because of this and only stick to competitive since you seem to find players who want/know how to play and a chance of seeing a map other than De Dust. That is basicly it, great game spoiled by small cons.
ULQ;-;A Review Mostly for me so I know Ive completed the story, high game time as well as feedback on the game. My Thoughts:- A team based FPS CT Vs T can be fun with a bunch of friends and the competitive mode is good fun, with weapon skins and team colours as well as a few good modes to pick from like death match, arms race, casual and some more. Achievements:- 156 of 167 (93%) Achievement Graphics:- An improvement on the last Counter Strike: Source game but nothing too special. Game Play:- Team Based type game where you have to rescue hostages or defuse a bomb. The aiming can take some time to get used to as when you go full auto with weapons you have to follow the bullets and not the crosshair. Story:- N/A Replayability:- Can become addictive if you play with friends or competitive What Could Be Added:- Different player skins/ colours Rating:- 9/10

Carter-Ninja;-;Sometimes there can be hackers, And other times there can be Butt holes. But really, This is probably 1 of the best games i have ever played. There are lots of updates and stuff that make the game little bit better every time. So, i would play this game 24/7 if i could. (Thumbs Up Guys!)
Coco | Grid;-;We're talking about the absolute TITAN in classic competitive first person shooters. The FATHER of addictive multiplayer combat set in a contemporary universe. Before Call of Duty. Before Battlefield. Before anything else that hefts up an AK-47 and and pulls back the charging handle... This did it first. And in many ways, it still does it best. I've met incredible people here. Some of the best friends of my life are actually from this. I've had incredible moments in this game. I've had laughter, moments of triumph, situations to overcome, comradery that I cannot even begin to describe, and a feeling of satisfaction that nothing else for $14.99 can come close to. (Short of a roadside BJ from your locals finest.) Nothing compares to the sharp, precise aim, the satisfying and punchy weapon bob... The sexy, sharpened and modernized gun models, crisp anti-aliased graphics running on a mature and tight version of Source... And the fact that this entirely new looking package is wrapped around the SAME hardcore game that 1.6 popularized way-back when, albeit with a few tweaks between all of the versions, means that it has a whole other layer that Battlefield, and Call of Duty can NEVER touch. "What is that 'layer' you speak of" you say? Many things, and the fact that I can SEE this clearly without ever stepping into the beating heart of CS:GO - competetive [At the time of this posting finally with no text limit, I have finally played 5 rounds of comp. 3 wins! It is a whole other amazing side to the game] is an achievement regarding the message this game wants to send its playerbase. - It's all about the community. It's all about a skill that needs to be HONED, not unlocked. It's about playing for HOURS and perfecting that single shot down that hallway. It's a game that stands perfectly on its own as a shooter, but manages to weave the MLG aspect into it seamlessly, without, in MY opinion... Dividing its playerbase. It's all there, all the time. A feeling of professionalism can wash over ANYONE in this game at least ONCE in their time with it. I can NOT say that about Source, or 1.6. Those were daunting, trudging beasts... Leviathans that I feel newcomers could not make headway in if they just wanted to have some fun and see what all the fuss is about. With the slight exception of Source. My time with that title was a mixed bag. Its graphics felt disjointed, and decidedly a mod, which is perfectly acceptable (duh)... But its shooting seemed almost RANDOM... And many 1.6 purists will say similar regarding not being able to enjoy the ballistics. The fact is that Counter Strike is often all about the MLG nowadays. And yet this entry in the franchise can stand on its own as a FUN game to just mess around in without feeling the pressure.... It is something to truly behold for ANY PC gamer. Being able to enjoy the hardcore without BEING hardcore is a treat. As you get better, the progression of your skill as a gamer feels tangible. You do NOT need unlocks, and idiotic modifiers to your gear to feel like you are getting anywhere. NOTHING gets in the way of your skill. No unlocks, no killstreaks, no aiming down sights... It's just you, your gun, your knife, and your ability to  UP the opposition. NOTHING else. It is such a worthy game that within a year of its release I'd been able to put over 350 hours into it, and I feel like more time could have been spent within its corridors, its rooftops, backrooms, and its long, stressful hallways. The feeling of PERSONAL progression and satisfaction I felt made me say left and right that I wished they'd add some kind of personalization, and a smart system that makes you MORE addicted. Not hats, just some way to make you give back to yourself in a meaningful way. A customization and unlock system for vanity gear would be fantastic, a new horizon for the game. It makes the game feel timeless, and without need of many other entries for some time, just updates for polish. And? Valve always listens. It's not PERFECT, but the skins add a new breath of air to the game. Even if you're not good, you're still the snob with that purple tier weapon, and everyone hates you. And they should. It's ok to hate on it just as much as it's ok to use these new pieces of bling. Everyone is doing it. And to speak of content? Valve games main strength has always been community based content that keeps your game living and breathing. Never slipping into the pile of "used up." There's always more to play with.... And now with the integrated workshop, and official server support for TOP map creations...(if you donate to both Valve and the makers, a hugely smart way for Valve to make money in a less greedy way than map packs). You can be assured that CS:GO has a lot more than just the addicting gameplay, community, the entertaining MLG scene, and most importantly self growth to keep you coming back thanks to these additions. The Arms Deal Update has its hand on your wallet, but through means of community driven sales, not just ones from the company... And NONE of it EVER affects your skill... Unless that purple SSG 552 fills you with divine rage that you just can't help but get headshot fever. you can make some decent digital goods money, and so can everyone else. I so no issue regarding this update, and thankfully after some weeks of growing pains, it seems everyone is on the same page. Intense firefights. Room for skill growth. The ABILITY (good luck) to have incredible social interactions.. Hilarious conversations. Things that I'll never forget. Especially thanks to the people I'd managed to call my best friends from this. Those are all the luck of the draw. But when you buy this game, one thing is for sure- You're buying a piece of gaming history with the freshest breath of fresh air I've ever seen. And it is a triumph.

EndlessMike;-;The good points: CS:GO isn't reinventing the wheel of first person shooters. If you've played any iteration of Counter-Strike over the years, you'll find most of the content very familiar. That said, GO adds enough to keep it interesting. All of the weapons feel unique and the variety of gameplay modes will mean endless hours of entertainment. The bad points: I've been playing video games for a long time and the CS:GO community might be the worst I've ever dealt with. In addition to the run-of-the-mill trash talk, you can expect to be inundated with anti-Semitic, racist, and/or homophobic slurs (I've heard some people use all three at a time to insult other players). I don't think I've ever heard someone say something insightful on the mic in all of the matches I've played. Your best bet is to simply mute as many players as possible. All in all, a great game as long as you ignore what everyone says during a match.

xFREEEDO;-;To the uninitiated: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is hitting an upward stride in the modern military competitive shooter world for good reason. Partially due to its strengths, but also Id argue (not here), due to the state of the game industry. Theres little reason to be a PC gamer and shooter fan and be clueless to this juggernaut. If you have even a bit of try-hard in you and a bit of skill, Id highly advocate absorbing CS:GO like a sponge and saying goodbye to any other shooter you previously thought was relevant. I could go on and on about the honed balance structure; from the economy, to the maps, to the weapons; all asymmetrically tilted to empower skill and enable strategy. But I wont. Take my word for it, its as close to perfect as Ive seen a game get. Dont get me wrong, I can nitpick some things; a few minor fringe gun complaints, 64 tick servers instead of 128 tick, but their patch performance at least shows overall that theyre on the right track. The chief of these points being restructuring maps to play better competitively (something I cant remember seeing in any other competitive fps, ever, maybe in the UT Quake days idk). BUT! Theres a good chance you already knew of this legend. Youve heard the fanboyish cries of devotion and likely thought to yourself Why the hell would someone pay $150 for a gun skin?! The game is that good when you get into the competitive aspect. HOWEVER! I must say for a casual player, especially one who has little to no interest learning competitive, theres not much here for you. There are casual modes, but theyre hard to enjoy knowing more light and care-free shooters are out there to play instead. The casual side of CS:GO is functional and passable, but itll feel like owning a Ferrari and only driving it in first gear, youre really not getting the potential out of the product. But who am I to judge? Perhaps youll get into the gun skin craze too and play the casual modes and have a blast! I doubt it, but hell the game is cheap and goes on practically-free sales every time we turn around, so why the hell are you reading this? Just buy the thing! All the cool kids are doing it!

Before Battlefield. Before anything else that hefts up an AK-47 and and pulls back the charging handle... This did it first. And in many ways, it still does it best. I've met incredible people here. Some of the best friends of my life are actually from this. I've had incredible moments in this game. I've had laughter, moments of triumph, situations to overcome, comradery that I cannot even begin to describe, and a feeling of satisfaction that nothing else for $14.99 can come close to. (Short of a roadside BJ from your locals finest.) Nothing compares to the sharp, precise aim, the satisfying and punchy weapon bob... The sexy, sharpened and modernized gun models, crisp anti-aliased graphics running on a mature and tight version of Source... And the fact that this entirely new looking package is wrapped around the SAME hardcore game that 1.6 popularized way-back when, albeit with a few tweaks between all of the versions, means that it has a whole other layer that Battlefield, and Call of Duty can NEVER touch. "What is that 'layer' you speak of" you say? Many things, and the fact that I can SEE this clearly without ever stepping into the beating heart of CS:GO - competetive [At the time of this posting finally with no text limit, I have finally played 5 rounds of comp. 3 wins! It is a whole other amazing side to the game] is an achievement regarding the message this game wants to send its playerbase. - It's all about the community. It's all about a skill that needs to be HONED, not unlocked. It's about playing for HOURS and perfecting that single shot down that hallway. It's a game that stands perfectly on its own as a shooter, but manages to weave the MLG aspect into it seamlessly, without, in MY opinion... Dividing its playerbase. It's all there, all the time. A feeling of professionalism can wash over ANYONE in this game at least ONCE in their time with it. I can NOT say that about Source, or 1.6. Those were daunting, trudging beasts... Leviathans that I feel newcomers could not make headway in if they just wanted to have some fun and see what all the fuss is about. With the slight exception of Source. My time with that title was a mixed bag. Its graphics felt disjointed, and decidedly a mod, which is perfectly acceptable (duh)... But its shooting seemed almost RANDOM... And many 1.6 purists will say similar regarding not being able to enjoy the ballistics. The fact is that Counter Strike is often all about the MLG nowadays. And yet this entry in the franchise can stand on its own as a FUN game to just mess around in without feeling the pressure.... It is something to truly behold for ANY PC gamer. Being able to enjoy the hardcore without BEING hardcore is a treat. As you get better, the progression of your skill as a gamer feels tangible. You do NOT need unlocks, and idiotic modifiers to your gear to feel like you are getting anywhere. NOTHING gets in the way of your skill. No unlocks, no killstreaks, no aiming down sights... It's just you, your gun, your knife, and your ability to  UP the opposition. NOTHING else. It is such a worthy game that within a year of its release I'd been able to put over 350 hours into it, and I feel like more time could have been spent within its corridors, its rooftops, backrooms, and its long, stressful hallways. The feeling of PERSONAL progression and satisfaction I felt made me say left and right that I wished they'd add some kind of personalization, and a smart system that makes you MORE addicted. Not hats, just some way to make you give back to yourself in a meaningful way. A customization and unlock system for vanity gear would be fantastic, a new horizon for the game. It makes the game feel timeless, and without need of many other entries for some time, just updates for polish. And? Valve always listens. It's not PERFECT, but the skins add a new breath of air to the game. Even if you're not good, you're still the snob with that purple tier weapon, and everyone hates you. And they should. It's ok to hate on it just as much as it's ok to use these new pieces of bling. Everyone is doing it. And to speak of content? Valve games main strength has always been community based content that keeps your game living and breathing. Never slipping into the pile of "used up." There's always more to play with.... And now with the integrated workshop, and official server support for TOP map creations...(if you donate to both Valve and the makers, a hugely smart way for Valve to make money in a less greedy way than map packs). You can be assured that CS:GO has a lot more than just the addicting gameplay, community, the entertaining MLG scene, and most importantly self growth to keep you coming back thanks to these additions. The Arms Deal Update has its hand on your wallet, but through means of community driven sales, not just ones from the company... And NONE of it EVER affects your skill... Unless that purple SSG 552 fills you with divine rage that you just can't help but get headshot fever. you can make some decent digital goods money, and so can everyone else. I so no issue regarding this update, and thankfully after some weeks of growing pains, it seems everyone is on the same page. Intense firefights. Room for skill growth. The ABILITY (good luck) to have incredible social interactions.. Hilarious conversations. Things that I'll never forget. Especially thanks to the people I'd managed to call my best friends from this. Those are all the luck of the draw. But when you buy this game, one thing is for sure- You're buying a piece of gaming history with the freshest breath of fresh air I've ever seen. And it is a triumph.
ULQ;-;A Review Mostly for me so I know Ive completed the story, high game time as well as feedback on the game. My Thoughts:- A team based FPS CT Vs T can be fun with a bunch of friends and the competitive mode is good fun, with weapon skins and team colours as well as a few good modes to pick from like death match, arms race, casual and some more. Achievements:- 156 of 167 (93%) Achievement Graphics:- An improvement on the last Counter Strike: Source game but nothing too special. Game Play:- Team Based type game where you have to rescue hostages or defuse a bomb. The aiming can take some time to get used to as when you go full auto with weapons you have to follow the bullets and not the crosshair. Story:- N/A Replayability:- Can become addictive if you play with friends or competitive What Could Be Added:- Different player skins/ colours Rating:- 9/10
Carter-Ninja;-;Sometimes there can be hackers, And other times there can be Butt holes. But really, This is probably 1 of the best games i have ever played. There are lots of updates and stuff that make the game little bit better every time. So, i would play this game 24/7 if i could. (Thumbs Up Guys!)
Creeps;-;After playing this game for a while I discovered that a lot of Russian guys have f*cked my mom. Great game!

HEADSHOT!
Xsaber;-;PROTIP: If you play too well, you'll start hearing a lot about the sexual history of your family members. ... and if you're lucky, you might just get vote-kicked by a group of eight year olds at their mom's seventy-fifth birthday party. what could be better
TacticalElephant;-;I love this game! Counter-Strike Global Offensive is a fast paced, team-based first person shooter. The Good There's so much good things to say about this game! It just all works so well, the gunplay feels fluid and is unforgiving. If you don't have your aiming down, you are going to get owned. It takes some practise, but it isn't as impossible to get into as the previous Counter-Strike games. This game is just so good, you'll have to buy it to experience it The Bad Nothing to put here [/b]The Verdict[/b] Best FPS on the market, definite must-buy! 10/10

Angelus  Mia | Killer Ldy;-;I think CSGO is the best FPS game of vavle 'till now. I spent my free time with my friends inside the CSGO's world. The beautiful graphic is also the streng point of this game. Cool Design army uniform, various game modes, ofcourse gameplay is awesome, the perfect combine between CS 1.6 and CSS... Dont' need to talk more, just play CSGO, ENJOY!

Goobus;-;A game where flipping out your knife constantly is essential to the game. Getting shot in the head while flipping out your knife earns you double points. 10/10 Would play again.
[XMP]Balthamous[HOM];-;TLDR: Don't play unless you can stand the hoards of idiots. If you don't like getting kicked from matches that are 2 rounds off finishing this game may not be for you, the game itself is alright perhaps not as good as 1.6 or even Source but its solid. The problem lies within the community which is the gaming equivelent of ebola. For every decent person you pass there are 200 small racist children, I've never heard the N word used so much in my many thousands of hour gaming as CSGO. Players constantly kick you for being simply not good at the game, even if you aren't doing badly, the kick function in both competitive and casual is abused to high hell. In the competitive side of the game if you have no team to play with, you are out of luck, because of the shear number of blockheads and racists who scream while playing. The community is often compaired to that of Leauge of Legands, but I'm going to say that it is in fact worse. I know this may be hard for some of you to invision but if you play this game you will understand why. If you do want to buy this game I would suggest ignoring valve servers entirly and just finding some nice community server to play on, don't get me wrong here the game ain't half bad but Jfc the playerbase.

Rhxpsody;-;10/10 would shoot chickens again
Fjllrv;-;Great competitive game. The only thing I would say I don't really like is Deathmatch. They didn't even try to make an attempt to make decent spawns. You constantly spawn infront of enemies, behind enemies, and in groups of enemies. Basically, if you're going to play Deathmatch then go in there with the knowledge that you will be spawn killed several times in a row and it's neither your fault nor the fault of the person who killed you. Also, keep in mind that Deathmatch is plagued with AWPs because there's no cash system in it. You can use whatever weapon you want. Other than that, I definitely recommend this to people who enjoy competitive FPS games. The other game modes are fun, community servers are nice as well. Some of the weapons need a bit more balancing, but they're not too bad. The community is....well, it's a gaming community. Take that as you will. If you want to play Competitive mode on an official server, I highly suggest finding friends to play with. It's not impossible to get in a game with a group of random people who are fun to play with, but it's extremely common to find people who are just in there trolling. Being AFK, jumping in front of shots, teamkilling, and just being obnoxious in general. Do keep in mind that playing with friends who are higher ranks than you will pretty much always lead to there being people on the other team who are higher ranks as well. Edit: After playing more, I have one more thing to add that's not good: Play with friends. The CSGO Competitive community is one of the most toxic gaming communities I've ever had the displeasure of being a part of. If you want to have fun, play with a full team of friends (5 people including yourself). Otherwise, I would just advise avoiding Competitive like the plague.
Gitorian;-;CS:GO offers the addictive and tense gameplay all Counter-Strike players know and love. With amazing weapon feel, great graphics for the dated Source engine, great maps, and a good community to play with even for beginners, CS:GO is a must buy for competitive FPS players.
SquireMcGroggins;-;Countless allnighters come to my mind when I hear the name "Counter-Strike" That game is something I'll remember discovering during my middleschool years. It to me, and i'm sure others, was a great way to escape and unwind after a long day. I don't see it slowing down in that department with Global Offensive. It combines the old with the new and I will admit that there is indeed a learning curve when it comes to aiming with those weapons but all it took was a few rounds of deathmatch and then I could effecetivly kill without being the "bambie" so to speak. Don't think this game is all gold and now scuffs. This game sure does have its short comings but that goes with any top notch game. Unless you're standing still and throwing grenades, you should compensate for the movemnet of the nade. I understand that this use to be something in Cs.s and other titles but I feel it's more apparent in Global. The balistics are far better than previous Counter-Strike games IMO,and it's interesting to see how the different guns have different spread and penetration, etc. This game is fantastic to play with friends, or if you're looking to make friends this game is still fun to play. Don't forget to practice if you're having a hard time with aiming, or understanding the map.

veNdeTTa33-* #;-;This game helped me make 1400$ from 0$ in a couple of months 10/10
MasAhan;-;Nice FPS Game :D
Koda;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety. Valve has not only updated the shooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries. This is Counter-Strike, whatever the format you choose to play it on, and there isn't a higher recommendation than that.
Vaagur;-;This game is a very popular terrorist/ counter-terrorist FPS. It features casual and competitive gameplay. It has a few different game modes and a large player base. The game is very balanced, there is alot of different weapons to choose from and the graphics are fine. You can also play against bots or play Deathmatches. If you happen to die and you have a bot in your team, you can control him to help your team win but it will not increase your own score. I've only played 1 mode so far, it is Bomb Defusing. In this mode you have 2 teams and the terrorist team has a bomber. The person who gets the C4 is chosen randomly and must set the C4 in one of the specific points. The counter-terrorists must defend the points and/ or kill all the terrorists to win the round. The terrorists needs to detonate the C4. The first to win 8 rounds like that ( they take about 2 minutes each, ) wins the match. I think it's a good game overall and if you're a fan of multiplayer FPS games, try it. The only CONS would be that you get crates while playing which requires a key to open ( you have to buy the key with real life money. ) I do believe the only thing those crates contain is cosmetic stuff. It's already a paid game, so it's a bit surprising, but it's not pay to win. Also some servers just lags even if your ping is good, no idea why, but usually finding a good server dosen't take too long.

Cute;-;Cheaters ruin this game at the higher ranks. Its disgusting how much money people throw away on cosmetic items to support an 'esport' filled with cheaters/match fixers. If it wasn't for that this game would be pretty good.
jip;-;If you ever wondered where the worst and utter scum of all living things since the origins of this planet is dwelling, search no more. The answer is: In this game, and it's such a high concentration of flaming 8yr olds, trolls, cheaters, leavers, teamkillers and s it makes me ponder if perhaps we should just sentence everyone playing to death by lethal injection. The world would be a wonderful place. You know, ISIS is actually scared  of the CSGO community, they fear them for their complete lack of brains which makes them dangerous enemies: You can't really kill them with headshots or beheadings. If things are well in your life and you desperately want to be depressed and have all that you hold dear destroyed then download this game and after only a few weeks your life will be hell on earth. Not to mention of course, everyone who ever touched this game is the worst racist, sexist and homophobic  you can think of, in fact it gets to a point where their stupidity becomes a parody of its own. If your hopes in the human race are not yet lost (which makes me question the content of your skull, honestly), this is the absolute and definite proof that mankind has no place on this or any other planet, and will hopefully wiped out rather sooner than later by a natural catastrophy of some sort or just animals picking up fully-automatic guns and killing every human and ape they can find. A dozen atomic bombs would also do nicely.
20fps;-;This version is a shame to the Counter Strike franchise, terrible map design where all ways to the bombsites are extremely claustrophobic and makes the game extremely CT sided together with powerfull smokes and fire grenades, not to mention useless flashbangs dont help the T side at all, bullet spread is completely wrong and overdone, you can spray 30 bullets into an opponent and only hit 1 or 2 bullets and skilled players are no longer able to clutch 1 vs X situations compared to CS 1.6, unbalanced weapons like MAG7 and P90, wallbanging was for the most part "removed", and sound positioning is terrible too. There are just too many wrong things with this game, if it wasnt for the skins and market system and valve spending money on tournaments this game would have never become popular. Hope this game stops being supported and valve releases a new proper version with help of the competitive community.
mostly nice;-;Long, long time CS fan and player. This one holds up to the original whilst bringing it up to date with all the other online FPS's out there. All the characteristics of CS & CS:Soruce are retained and creates the old simplistic adrenline rush it has done for well over a decade now. Every steam member should have this game.

BlueDemon;-;If you're reading this review, be sure to read all of it due I placed an update, but I did not want to change the original review. this game is 7/10 Positive: [] Huge community (veteran players, kids, noobs, masters) [] amazing eSport scene [] Example of a team work game [] you can make money with this game Negative [] worst system anti cheater, they can do it better, but they will not do it because valve love sell more copies to the cheaters []64 tick. WTF valve!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE NEED MORE! [] CHEATER EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!, IN DM, CASUALS, MM, DEMOLITION AND GUNGAME CHEATER EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!! this game is 7/10 EDIT: update (3 of july 2015) I have been following the complete scene of this game and im back here to change something about my original review (that I have not modified and you can read it above). Valve is listening to the community and they have been doing constant VAC ban waves. Also they put some new system to prevent the immediately access in MatchMaking to the cheaters and smurfers (in this part i dont mind but for a lot of people is a issue, they are listening) Now i can say 8/10. Great game.

smarthio;-;I must admit, Valve is doing great job in making this game, with beautiful updated Source engine, everything looks more & more great even to CS:S. In addition of that, CS:GO added several new CT & Terrorist factions, new weapons & equipments, also there's customized weapons skins & many, many things have changed. Totally a must have for Valve & CS series fans. 10/10
Z_Man_115;-;A very complex gunplay system makes for extremely realalistic fire fights. its a change of pace from BF3/4 and COD but it requires more skill to play then ether of these games, this will lead to a higher tiers of playing. Although the ranking syatem needs an overhaul for the competitive mode as it is based on wins and not individual score this can often lead to mis ranking you to lover or jigher tiers. 8.5/10

Miss Selfie;-;A great shooter in comparrison for others in the same genre, CSGO relies on a know-how- basis on how to aim and control your firing, aswell as the differnce among each weapon. The fourth game in the CS series (If you rule out the japanese ones), CSGO is quickly described as an updated CSS but with much better graphics, animations, more content aswell as a whole new shooting system. There are alot of old weapons from the previous games, though all having their different stats changed to suit CSGO's new system. 8 new weapons are introduced aswell, some replacing previous ones from the other games. As for playable characters, CSGO has a whole new layout. Previous CS games had 4 (CSCZ 5) characters to choose from after selecting a team. This isn't the case with CSGO, here you are forced to be one out of 5 almost identical characters from a certain faction. As an example, anarchists, all sharing the same model, but wearing different masks and small details. Several previous factions, like the phoenix connexion, return, though not all, like the arctic avengers. While the increase of factions has made CSGO interesting to play, sadly since its launch 2 years ago, the game has yet to have seen any new added factions. Visually the whole game feels more down to earth and realistic. The default maps are plenty, and several old maps from previous games return, including Aztec, office, vertigo, dust maps among others. Something new in this CS game that wasn't in previous games, is weapon skins. The idea coming from Team Fortress 2, you have a chance of getting item drops at the end of each game. It could be a weapon skin or a case (TF2's version being the crate). Using a skin will replace the default weapon's looks. You can trade or sell these weapon skins and cases over the steam market, or buy from the market itself with real currency. This CS game also introduces competetive play. Searching for a match, you are teamed up with 4 other random players to fight against 5 other players on the opposing team. Playing 15 rounds in total. Each time you win, you get closer to getting a better rank. Same goes if you lose a match, you get closer to getting your rank decreased. Usually with this rank system, you are played against and with players on the same rank. Almost. It is a common thing that you face against players near your rank. Rarely ever exactly the same rank. You can also play with friends, despite their rank being either lower or better than yours. This leads to a very unbalanced rank system that CSGO has. The community is by far the most negative thing about this CS game. It is very common for players to insult each other, making this community by far the worst of all gaming communities in history, even exceeding the CoD communities. Be wary if you are very sensitive to insults. This community is also known for its scamming for weapon skins. Because of the high amounts some of the more rare items cost over the steam market, alot of scamming goes about with different ways to trick other players into giving their weapons for free or lesser priced skins. Valve has stated they won't be able to help you if you get tricked. The most common trick is a random user on steam adding you, then sending you a link if you add them. If you press on this link, you risk getting a virus that will take over your account. Overall this CS game is worth every cent. But be wary of its community.
Novahkiin;-;This game is perfect if you like first person shooters. The competitiveness in this game is far more higher than any other game i have played. Very fun and enjoyable if youre the type of person that gets enjoyment out of FPS games.
SuperMOMOJr;-;CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.
Zyph;-;Field Ratings Remarks Graphics 9.5 Definitely a huge improvement for the Counter-Strike Franchise. Gameplay 9.0 Different modes will try to entertain us, I'd say Casual will always be the best in mind. Story N/A All i know is that you hold a gun and shoot stuff. Multiplayer 8.0 Half of the community is russian and not speaking english, Making it difficult to play competitive sometimes, Other then that, It's alright. Replayability 10 Great game with a great replayability. Overall 10/10 Ever since i played Counter-Strike 1.6, I loved that game, But due to motion sickness, I never liked playing it sometimes, Gave me the headache and wanting to vomit. Don't worry, It's a good game. Then i strolled over to Counter-Strike Online, It was a awesome game, A good improvement from 1.6, It was back then i didn't had steam. When i have steam, I saw Counter-Strike:Global Offensive, Really looked alike like Modern Warfare, But the game was so different, and that is what makes it so enjoyable! Good game, My most played game forever.
Pegasus;-;The best game ever!

So basically i mainly used auto-p90 which pretty sure every silver did to! next 7 month your going to be an MG-MGE- If you go try hard then ur main gun is ak - awp , then after 1-2 years you will see your self making a team and making such nice good friends online! This game is the best guys! you need to get it for who ever doesn't have it! ~Cheers.
Yamikuza;-;It was my girlfriends birthday. But I needed a knife! We broke up </3
Fairy;-;It may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps (Assault, anyone?), and little features of past games, but Global Offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking Counter-Strike for whoever wants it. Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.

wildr0y;-;everyone hacks
Player;-;Pros: Great competitive gameplay. Perfect balance. Nice visuals and sounds. Regular updates and support. Cons: Very addictive. Ugly community mostly consisting of motley horde. Keys and cases. You can waste like 1000$ and get weapons worth 10$ only. Matchmaking and ranking system isnt good enough. I cant recommend this game, because i wasted so many time(about 800 hours summary on 3 accs) in it chasing wins and ranks,wasting money on 0.01% chance of getting knife and still i have nothing.Do not buy it, i am sure you have much more important things to do.

Kutya7701;-;Currently one of the best and only real competitive fps out there. A great variety of weaponry and maps. The game also gets constant updates from community feedback. However it has a vey big learning curve. For the first 50 hours or so you won't be very good at the game. As long as you get decent skill after that, you will have alot more fun.

xoT-Sweezy;-;Global Offensive is a new addition to the Counter Strike series. This game features a unique tactical gameplay with 2 teams. -The Counter Terrorists (CT's): Anti - Terrorist group from over the world. SAS, SWAT, FBI and the Israel Defense Force. Their objective is to rescue hostages in (cs_) maps or in (de_) maps to defend a bombsite from the terrorists. - The Terrorists (T's): Terrorists are the bad guys. They need to defend hostages from being rescued from the CT's or need to bomb bombsites that the CT's must defend. Ofcourse this Counter Strike feature new and the classic maps like de_nuke and one of the best maps : de_dust2 and also features new gamemodes like: -Arms Race an official version of one of the most populair mod gun game. Where people need to make kills with all weapons given. The first one to get a kill with the "golden knife" wins -Demolition a all new gamemode with elements of Arms Race within small demolition maps where T's need to bomb the bombsite. -Deathmatch a deathmatch on Counter Strike maps with the idea of the chaos from game like Quake 3. This game is for everyone. From Counter Strike veterans to people that are new to FPS's altough it can be hard to get started. In my opinion the best thing they added to Counter Strike is the Competetive modes. Counter Strike always was one of the most competetive games ever but you needed to find matches and a team on chatrooms like IRC, Quakenet and those sort of things. Now it doesnt matter if you have a full team or your on your one. You can always find matches like this. This is just the normal Counter Strike maps. But the gameplay changes drastically. This is a dead serious mode so this is not somewhere where you should grief or  around. This is a COMPETETIVE mode. People want to COMPETE. Prepare for battle. However you don't need to be the best in Counter Strike to play competetive mode. After 10 wins you will be set in a skill group. To this skill group you will be matched to people with almost the same skill. So you don't have to worry. The new Arms Deal update provided us with many new skins for you guns. This is a great addition. You can buy and or get weapons for free by playing the game. Also new in this series is temporary map packs like the Operation Payback and the Operation Bravo. This is a mappack that you can pickup for 5 eur's that feature the most liked custom maps on official Valve servers. No lagg and your favorite maps on stable servers. My opinion about Global Offensive is that it is the best Counter Strike. I started playing Counter Strike Source 5 years ago. I loved the gameplay and the tactics. Then Global Offensive came out and i was tought this wasn't gonna be a good game. But it proven itself. Valve did a great job with this game. Most of the things i missed on Source are there in Global Offensive. For example the competetive mode i explained before. Written by Stefan (T-Sweezy)
Durpy;-;I love this game!..I may suck.....but that doesn't matter! r-right ?
para;-;I've played this game for close to 800 hours over the past year or so... and I have nothing better to do, so here's a really long in-depth review of ''Counter-Strike: Global Offensive''! To start I'd like to point out that this game has a huge skill gap, meaning someone who's been playing for a year will be exponentially better than someone who's just starting. (Which is common with most games, but this game needs to have a lot of time put into it in general to be semi decent..) Learning spray patterns and maps can be time consuming, but in the long run will pay off hugly. CS doesn't always have the best community to help you out though, this can be a major turn off in this regard. Sure there are videos to look up and guides on the steam hub, but if you lack knowledge of something in-game you can assume you'll get flooded with insults and negativity. Not all people are like this, but from spending lots of time in ''Silver'' ranking, I have noticed lacking some information is just asking for trouble with some players. (Silver is the lowest of the MM ranks, meaning the newer or lower skill level players. The reason I bring this up is that most people will be placed in silver, meaning that they will have to go through huge amounts of negativity before being able to improve.) And ofcourse there is always the option of reporting people for being ''offensive'' or not being a good teammate, but as in other games this is nearly never enforced. This isn't always an issue in the higher ranks though, some people can be supporting and helpful in their pursuit to get better! So if you're new to gaming you may not really understand the importance of having a group of people to play with, do you? This is one of the things I can't stress enough to people who wish to play this game or who are having troubles with it. Never. Play. Alone. Plant those words into your head, never forget them. Now I don't want this to seem like some guide to get better, but all I want to bring to attention is that this is a ''Team Based Shooter''. With that being said, it's a lot better to have a nice group of people to play with, so keep that in-mind if you decide to buy this title. (As I said in the first part of this review, the random people you meet in-game aren't always the nicest...) Now that, that is over let's get into a more fun yet controversial topic... skins and in-game transactions! The only reason I'm adding a small section for this is due to the fact this can push people away from games in the fear of them being ''Pay2Play''. And I won't lie when I say Valve does it right with CS;GO, they made it a truley fair platform which seems to be hard for most devs to do now a days. There are 3 mains things you can spend your money on in CS;GO, one of those being skins/stickers. Skins and Stickers are mainly added to make your weapons look nicer than their default variation, this ofcourse being 100% optional. (No skins or stickers raise stat's of guns, they're just re-skinned weapons.) The nxt way you can spend money in-game is with Valve's famous in-game gambling... I mean weapons crates and keys! A case and key are basically items in-game that can be used together to craft or ''open'' another item, usually being a re-skinned weapon. Crates can be bought from the market for their on-going price which goes up and down depending on the situation of the economy. (They can also be gotten from in-game drops, which are basically random items you can get from playing games of CS;GO. While I'm on the topic of drops, you can get re-skins from drops too, but these are the ''worst of the worst'' skins in most people's eyes.) And then all you need from here is a key, which you can happily buy from the CSGO shop for $2.5 or your national equivalent. Before I move on to the third and last set of things to be bought, I'd like to say that opening cases is never worth it! I'm not trying to be a buzz kill in any way, I just want to bring it to people's attention that wasting $100's isn't always going to guarantee you a nice shiny skin or your money back. And now for the last but not least... Operations! Operations are like DLC in the sense of it adds 5 new maps to the game, but only for the limited time (Usually 3-4 months). The Operations have differing prices, when it first comes out it will cost around $7, then go down to $4, then to $1. Operations also give you nice rewards like case drops that only ''Operation Owners'' will get, these are nice in the sense of they sell for lots of money on the market, and can easily make your money back from what you spent on the pass. Now that's all I want to say about this subject, but again I just wanted to make it clear that this game is NOT ''Pay2Play'' at all. Does this game have a dedicated dev team to fix problems and update the game? This question is something you always want to ask when buying a game like this, since in the end it's all multiplayer and can get old over time. Well I'll be honest when I say yes and no. The dev team is really good about coming out with updates every week or two, may they be bug fixes or full blown out updates. (New maps, weapons, etc.) There's always the issue of missing things or adding ''useless'' things into the game, but that doesn't seem to happen too often. Does CS;GO get old? Meh, that isn't for me to say, it did for me but that can change from person to person. They try to add and remove enough every so often so it doesn't, but there's always the fact of a game being played to the point where it just isn't fin anymore, nothing can stop that. And while we're on this topic I'd also like to bring up that Valve has added an amazing workshop feature to this game. It really gives people the power to add to the game and makes it fun to see how creative some of the players really are! I'd like to end this by saying that CSGO is a good game full of amazingcommunity servers, competitive gamemodes and just lots of fun to be had with friends. For this price, I'd reccomend this to anyone who enjoys FPS and skill based games. Thanks for reading and have fun if you do end up buying the game! :D
#Rogue.;-;You call this cs:go? Well I call it cs:bad Cmon Valve, you should rename this game to cs: stop...playing it cuz its bad Bad things about this game: This game is total trash, out of all the variety of unique weapons, people only use M4A4/M4A1-S, Ak47, or AWP in this game. The shooting mechanics and recoil is too much and mostly hard for newbies on this useless game. The sounds of this game is a copy from MW3 COD engine, and the gun sounds are too wubby and trappy 4 me. SMGs should be called Small Marshmellow Gun shooters. The damage of SMG's are worse than trying to knife someone, the damage point blank up close on the chest takes 10000000 bullets while you only need lucky headshots on these small tf2 hitboxes, you can get more kills with the lowest tier pistol than an SMG. The only SMG that is decent is p90, you see noob spray that pee pee gun around and spam it to your death. MP7 should have no recoil like COD MW3 and real life #unrealistic game. Shotguns are worse, it's the 100% nerf on COD shotguns. It seems like the bullets are freakin' Hasbro Nerf darts made from Nike sweatshops in China. Up close point blank with any shotgun = no kill. Don't bother about using LMG (why is it called light machine guns when it's more heavy than a OVERSIZE truck full of my diarrhea?) Ak47 is more OP compared to the M4A4 with damage and 1 hit headshots from any range. To even shoot accurately, you have to stand still and memorize the tarded spray pattern. If you move 1 mm, the bullets fly up to the sky then. The scout sniper rifle is a joke, it's only a hitmarker unless it's a headshot. The silenced weapons do more damage and are more accurate. I seriously don't get how big the recoils are for every weapon, it's like the Counter Terrorists are some scrawny 16 year olds and can barely hold the gun and the Terrorists are some recruited ISIS 12 year olds with towels on their head, dumb talibans. I'm surprised the Terrorists doesn't have an RPG, wouldn't matter anyway since it would only do 0.1 damage. The bullet's must not do damage or just dissapear in thin air since most of the shots doesn't register, saying you only did 10 damage with 1 bullet, gg. This is the only game where you need luck and aim for headshots while shooting else where is useless with the armor, oh....and if you get shot at, you move 100000% slower which unrealistic unless it's your legs being shot at, espeically with all that armor. People use hearing like it's sitrep pro from COD MW3 which is annoying to preshoot you and crap. Knfing is useless other than running faster, idk why the camos worth 100000000000000000000000 dollars. Same with any other weapons and their stranges. Who even uses the zeus? The recoil is so horrid, it needs to be mentioned again. Why have a crosshair when you spray, you aim the crosshair where should be on the player, ON THE GROUND so the bullets fly up in the air is now at your target. I think these CT were trained in the Army so that the recoil and aiming is stupid and the Osama Bin Laden squad is just naturally bad at aiming. Stormtroopers can aim better than these useless guns with its mechanics, jesus. The only recoil spread I can master is the AWP. This game has no killstreaks, such wow, lame. Why have the rest of the other unique and well made maps when the only map people play is Dust 2? Demolition is a new game mode that is trash and similar to gun game from CoD, casual is what people only play, deathmatch is the even worse version of TDM in CoD, the spawns are worse than MW2 rust.....I would spawn infront of someone or someone 2 feet away from me and get graped from behind, arms race is just plain stupid, just a copy of CoD mw3 gun game. Hostage is very unique, but only have to rescue one to win?? How bout the other 2 guys that's right next to each other to pick up? Plus the terrorists push more than the CT.... GG. Competitive is full of tryhard plebians and casual is full of smurfs. If you leave a competitive match that's unfinished, you get consquences by can't join another comp match for 30 min, then 2 hours, 24 hours, then week or something. You get temp banned basically....I can understand if people ragequit, but what if I have to take a dump for 10 hours? Or my mom nags me to get off? Or even a shark-nado came and hit my house and I got no power? This is dumb, last time I check this game isn't League of Legends. A genius way for wasting your hard working McDonald job's money, they added camos and stickers to guns. The only good camos for the "only good weapons" in the game are like 100000000000 bucks, worse than buying hats on tf2. Stickers are a rip off, you only have 1 time to apply it with a terrible POV inspecting it before you apply it, you can scrape it which ruins the quality, idk why that is a thing since you can't "scrape" it off and put it back on with a different spot on your gun, just have a remove button instead >.> or at least let you re-apply stickers. The community is terrible, you get kicked if you're bad or if someone calls "clutch or kick" with a lot of ghosters in casual. This game is worse than all the CODs, especially Black ops 1-2 and ghosts. No wonder this game costs less than the old Counter Strike games and still doesn't worth 15 bucks. I am a major Valve fan owning L4d1-2, Tf2, HL series, etc....and this game just dissapoints me, Hidden Path either ruined it or Valve wanted to took a crap on us and want money so Gabe can eat it, thinking it's celery and losing fat. I play video games 24/7 and never go outside. This game makes me want to go outside and burn like the casper the friendly ghost white skin I have from the sun as the vampire I am. This game created Al-Queada and ISIS groups. Blame this game for 9/11. This game gave me cancerous aids, along with everyone else who bought the game. Changes game needs: Shooting mechanics like COD (no mentally ill re-tarded recoil cuz characters in game dont know how to adjust recoil). SMG and shotgun buffs, ak47/m4a4/m4a1-s nerfed. Add rpgs, killstreaks. How do I aim down sights and run? Good things about this game: None.
TigazZz*;-;The next era of Counter Strike, a game more focused on the competitive side of things. You will get addicted to it, even if you one of the skeptic that enjoyed Source and 1.6 so much that you think that Global Offensive isnt really for you. Just try it, you will love it and then it will become a sickness. It still got that CS feeling but with better graphics, more maps and some new guns, how can we say no to this? Pros: - Competitive matchmaking - Skins = Swag Points. - You can actually make some money off skins - Lots of maps, a mix of classic and new ones. - New operations being released regularly. - Gaben Cons: - Squeakers and mongols - Cheaters - Ban system specifics (You can get a 7 day ban for losing connection, for example) 8/10.

l44l[];-;Come on valve first: paid weapons skins And now paid music?? Are you ing serius .... The game is not much more than cs 1.6 and css only graphic improvments maybe at least i did not see them but people say it's better looking... Anyway don't buy if you don't like store like menus and being reminded to buy this or that...
Iguana;-;My dad didn't like this game and now he's dead.
mM;-;Nice tactical shooter. Sometimes I have to rage. But its ok. Nice team game.
Skywarp;-;PLAY THIS GAME OR GET OFF THE INTERNET!!!!!!!!!!!
TraviztY  | crimson.gg;-;The game itself is actually very good, but it has some really big flaws Its mainly popular because of skins. With that comes the following: Scammers Theft Phising Accounts Befriending Rigging Throwing Smurfing Trolling All around s 13 year olds that are sleeping with my mom and last but not least Hacking all of the above are main reasons I don't put much time into this game anymore. The skins are fun and great, but I personally think they ruin the community with too much corruption. Steam says 140,000 playing now. 40,000 are in idle servers waiting for drops of cases and skins Play at your own risk, Don't click any links from anyone ever if you start trading. I still recommmend checking it out, as like I said. It is a good game.

David Baguetta;-;Awesome game when you first begin to play it, it might seem like  in the beginning, but then it gets more enjoyable. Really like how they put in the competitive mode, but the queue time might be f**ked up from time to time. the first 10 wins should also be more accurate on how YOU performe, cuz if you get "carried" up in rank, you can expect to meet people way above your skill level. All in all, a great game :-D

I'm a kawaii crab;-;Its a good game ok?
Sharkahm;-;Counter-Strike is well-known to be the best competitive modern First Person Ego Shooter. Obviously 'competitive' is stressed. This means the game is very hard for the beginners, because of its depth. You simply cannot jump into that game without any knowledge or guide... you can do that on casual ones tough. And there are too many of these out there. E-Sports is also the priority of the game. It is also responsible for the extreme balance and balance fixes that Valve takes care off. This is a significant factor to keep the game enjoyable on the long term. Of course you can run and gun with a P90 or camp with the autosniper, which is easy, but good players can defend themselves well. Some have great crosshair placement to eliminate the threat with a simple click: - "Boom. Headshot." Not only crosshair placement, but also the recoil control, the positioning, the movement or let's just shorten it, the whole experience and skills can differenciate a CS veteran and a simple amateur. These skills and experince need to be trained otherwise you end up being punished. Badly. The main focus of the game is the competitive mode, where you play with four teammates against five enemies for up to an hour. Talking about teammates, playing with friends is the best thing you can do there. In most games the team isn't as important as in CS:GO. Everybody is important since it's 5vs5 and not more. YOU NEED TO COMMUNICATE. This is the actual key to victory aswell as having a glorious match! There are too many strangers who do destroy the game experience and like every competitive game, they can be toxic. After winning a while, you'll get a rank which allows you to play with people with the same skill set as you do. Well, most of the time; I'm talking about smurfers. Those aren't a long term problem tough - they'll get to a certain rank and then it's useless, but can be used for trolling... Luckily I haven't met many trolls. Back to the ranks: I have a certain statement about these. I wish they added team ranking aswell as solo rank just as they did in Dota 2. Oh, they should definitively add more clan functions like the other game I mentioned. Hacks are a minor problems there - Overwatch will take care of it, but someone has to suffer until the hacker gets banned... Many outsiders think that CS has bad graphics. I don't think so since CS:GO. They're decent and acceptable and every other thing makes this "problem" up. The source engine is not bugfree of course, but is has been proven to be relatively reliable. It should not be forgotten that CS can run on many hardware flawless. Skins and operations are not required to be paid - you'll get drops and if your friend has an operation, you still can play with him/her. Skins can be obtained by simply playing, betting through CSGOlounge, buying from the steam market, steam trading and by opening boxes. The boxes require keys, which cost 2 Euros each. You can get a really expensive skins, mediocre skins and skins that you wish you could undo it. Chances are that you end up at the third option and are trying to build a time machine. Operations are seasons passes with maps provided by the community. These only last for a while. I must say that is good idea that the community can earn money from valve by providing maps and skins... when it's successful enough. All in all CS:GO is a good buy if you're willing to spend enough time on it. It'll come to fruition and become a rewarding game. Some matches can ruin it tough. Valve proves again for being one of the greatest video game developer.

f1nchw0w;-;A well designed, tacticul, FPS. One must not only have the skill to shoot a gun and land that perfect headshot, but you have to know when to change your course of action at a seconds notice.
Baxter;-;Definitely a great game. This game is a step up from the typical shoot-em-up Call of Duty games. A bit more of a learning curb, but I would definitely recommend. Ranked matches, competetive play, casual play, and unique random reward systems.
The Golden Nova;-;Valve serves up a no frills, pure skills, truly enjoyable and all-consuming shooter for your fragging needs.

fop / botch;-;Do you like guns? Crates? Guns shooting at crates? Crates shooting at guns? If your answer is yes (or even if it's no), you're in luck! Valve has decided to create the next-gen version of their Counter-Strike franchise and added this great game to the fray! Play with friends, get yelled at for not playing a tactically-perfect manner during the eco round by twelve-year-olds! The gang's all here! Spend your life savings on Stat-trak versions of your favorite guns so you can brag about how many pubs you've "pwned" when you should have been working! A game so amazing and full of crates, you'll wonder why Valve even gives them away! Gabe, you've done it again!
(99W)C-Monkey;-;Hands downt the best pure FPS on the Market. This is a staple for someone wanting to break into competitve gaming and wants to learn how tactics and teamplay is valued. You don't have to worry about leveling up or someone having a better gun then you or attachement, everyone has access to all the same guns making it a completely balanced game. It also offers a very enjoyable casual community and deathmatch for just having fun. Countless amounts of custom servers with addons and mods that add tons of variety to an already near perfect game. The game is constantly updated and improved upon by developers that actively listen to the community.

Revan The Bleeding Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

fcuk;-;I love this game with all my
Takoyaki!;-;this game is awesome :D
what username?;-;What can I say, this game is made by Valve, therefore I am obligated to love it. In all honesty, this game is in some cases harder than other FPS's I've played, and in other cases easier. The community is large-I've yet to find a lobby that has less than 5 people in it. The game also runs on the Source engine, resulting in very attractive graphics that have a minimal impact on my GPU. Either way, I love this game and recommend it to anybody who is looking for a cheap, easy first person shooter.
Mobert;-;CS:GO is the latest entry into the Counter Strike franchise, and a worthy one at that. Guns feel and sound powerful, classic maps mixed in with the new spice things up a little, and it's oh-so rewarding when you finally master that gun you've been trying so hard to get more equipped with. Pick it up if you're looking for a challenging-but-rewarding multiplayer shooter.
Eh' SAMEON largh```;-;Best Game Ever :D ! train to imba bcom to imba ^_^
JAY Z;-;worth game must buy <3
ValdrieN;-;VERY NICE FPS GAME !! Good Job for steam & valve
patoK';-;Buy now if you are looking for a good FPS game! Controls are great and there are also diffrent controls like to see how your gun is. When you have your left over cents you can buy some camo's for your gun but they could get scratched! In any other words I would suggest this game! :)
Vector;-;A great successor to Source, Global Offensive delivers in every way, from improved graphics to overall better gameplay. It is very much a modern shooter while staying true to the Counter Strike franchise. Any fans of the previous game and any new players should check this out.
Juan duk;-;This is such a pretty good shooting game or FPS you can play whatever you wanna play example : if you wanna fight with other players like serious you can play competitive . This mode is pretty nice when you're having a competition with other players . But if you don't wanna get serious playing you can play casual there are many noobs there seriously but sometimes there're so much players and i don't wanna play with them cause i can't kill anyone :( lol , Anyway there're many funny guys on casual so if you wanna play for fun you can play casual but don't get serious on it cause it's not competition it's just play for fun though. Hope this Guide helps :) See ya.
ZixZs <3 (VAC BAN);-;very nice game
[DbR]<<<what>>>?;-;HOLY  PREPARE TO DEDICATE YOUR LIFE TO SKINS AND STICKERS
Schmerskhvn;-;I guess it`s the better way to have fun And you may have some nice skins that like in some Dota or TF2 so why not while it`s on sale?
l a z y b o n e s;-;I've been playing CS 1.6 since after its' release, hell i've been playing CS since the release of 1.5 even(Mainly on non-steam LAN tho, i must confess) and thus far this is probably the best. it has the smooth and proper aim of 1.5 for most part when it counts, the accuracy of pistols are absolutely nostalgic in it and all pistols are actually worth playing with now with the change in damages. when it comes to SMGs and Rifles it's much more similar to 1.6 in early days except for AK47, GOD knows how i missed the super-accurate AK47 from 1.6. It also makes more sense to play with Galil and Famas now. About the sniper, well...i've never used sniper when it was serious but an amazing sniper i knew got interested in this game after playing around with AWP and SSG for around 10minutes. Almost forgot about the Heavy group of loadout being muuuuch more fun to play now and how the shotguns aren't useless from more than 10meters away. The only thing which was abit harder to enjoy on this release was jumping. Harder than 1.6 but with much more of a...kinda...air-control, guess i should say. Might be annoying at first, but you'll surely enjoy it after getting used to it. On top of all those improvements, there are weapon skins now making it more fun for the casual players. Another thing worthy of mentioning would be netcode improvements. Since i've always played videogames with higher amounts of pingtime i've been more careful about that part. in CS:GO you get to search for servers with pings as high as 350ms! Now...it doesn't really sound good when said alone, but the netcode is done well enough to make sure it's still playable with such high latency(However you have to cover the high ping time with better and faster reflexes at the end again). On a last note, i really hope valve improves the source engine. A little bit prettier envirounment and characters while saving the simple-looking options wouldn't hurt.
A.;-;Tiz game iz gud 4 pipul hwo liek to ply pew pew
Cassaca;-;Like the previous games in the series, Global Offensive is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter. Each player joins either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist team and attempts to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team. The game operates in short rounds that end when all players on one side are dead or a team's objective is completed. For most game modes, once a player dies, they must wait until the round ends to respawn. Players purchase weapons and equipment at the beginning of every round with money awarded based on their performance. Completing objectives or killing enemies earns the player money while negative actions, like killing a teammate or hostage, takes money away from the player. In addition, when a round ends all players receive some amount of money, with players on the winning team receiving substantially more. Counter Strike Global Offensive adds new weapons and equipment not seen in previous installments, most notably the firebomb for each side (Molotovs for Terrorists and incendiary grenades for Counter-Terrorists). These temporarily cover a small area in fire, dealing damage to anyone passing through.

David Baguetta;-;Awesome game when you first begin to play it, it might seem like  in the beginning, but then it gets more enjoyable. Really like how they put in the competitive mode, but the queue time might be f**ked up from time to time. the first 10 wins should also be more accurate on how YOU performe, cuz if you get "carried" up in rank, you can expect to meet people way above your skill level. All in all, a great game :-D

Ga5huX;-;I thought CS 1.6 or Quake would never be outdated but CS:GO managed to make it. I'll go straight to the point: this is the best multiplayer shooter game. A real game for esport and casual competition: - a great gameplay for huge possibilities for whoever can appreciate fps games. - an addictive game when you find a team or people to play with. - graphics are great (cs source players, you're going to feel a change) - a high required level of skill, strategy and game sense, so a really competitive community (that's not CoD, kids). And the game is still young and probably going to be still improved. As usual, many cheaters and some obnoxious players may blot its copybook, but damn, this game is great.
vLgTF2| MouseCake;-;100% one of the best fps games out there. Extremley different from the cod franchise, but much better ;)
TrevorST;-;I stand there surveying the battlefield, full of my deceased comrades. During that time i had two things on my mind, one being that my fate determines on this moment, and that my AWP Redline looks intimidating with my newly added "Welcome to the Clutch" sticker. With that boost of confidence I ready myself for whatever comes next. I then instinctivly tap 'tab' to see what im going up against, and mutter under my breath, "Pshhh 1v3.... eZ." I then approach the bombsite where i come in sight of my prey. I stare the target down like a fat boy eyeing a stick of butter. Deciding to make my move I lick my finger, gathering as much saliva as possible, and cram it down the subjects ear. He screams in agonizing pain, and torture. I know I must finish him, so I grasp for his bloomers, and pull. Thus summoning an atomic wedgie which instantly incapacitates the man. Knowing what I have done I cannot help but tea bag the corspe a few times. Meanwhile I recieve a message stating that the bomb was planted. I suddenly stop the nonsense and move on to my next set of victims. Which were going to be tougher to crack than the first. I think of what I am going to do next, knowing I do not have much time, so I do what is best. I conjure my inner animal. Resulting to me being restrained to using the Deagle in a showy manner. I then come into sight of the bombsite, to abruptly run into my pursuers. My inner animal guides me toward my desiard location, and fires resulting in a collateral killing them both. In shock, I swiftly head towards the bomb knowing it will go off at any moment. But all worries fade when I am quickly informed by a gentleman on the opposing team, that F10 is a shortcut for instant defuse. Before executing the task, I mutter,"idiot." And spam the F10 key as fast as I can with my right index finger, overcome with joy I begin my victory chant to celebrate our win. But when I look back at my screen it reveals an EXACT copy of my desktop, that is INTERACTABLE. Holy cannoli, Valve you really did over due your self on this extrodinary easter egg. I really anticipate you guys adding more stuff like this easter egg in the future, never in my life have i seen so much detail be put into something so little.

Revan The Bleeding Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

TheIdesofMay;-;I've gone through at least 3 keyboards, purchased 4 seperate copies, spent >50 on skins and subscribed to 4 CS:GO twitch.tv channels, all because of this one game. What can I say? It's the purest FPS shooter that money can buy. No killstreaks, no deathstreaks, no commander mode, no marksman bonuses, nothing. You buy a gun, aim it at someone's head, and BANG; the person with the highest skill level level will make it out alive. That's why the game is still so popular. If you enjoy the FPS genre, do yourself a favour... Buy this game.
[Bro] MrStabsPT;-;You have to play this game! I never saw anything like this. An awesome first person shooter! I recommend it to everybody!!! :D
John "JP817" DiGiorno?!;-;The Counter Strike franchise was introduced to me by CS:GO. Several friends of mine were constantly playing so I decided to buy this game. One of the best decisions I've made! This game is the best competitive fps out there and one of the best fps games. It's not a game where you play to unlock guns, attachments, scopes etc. The only thing to work foward to is getting better. This game has a pretty big emphasis on death because the fact you live once per round and you must buy guns at the start of a round, you do not spawn with them. This game also has a huge emphasis on strategy. There is strategy everywhere from how to defend bomb sites to where you plant the bomb on the bomb site. There are two competitve gamemodes: A bomb scenerio and a hostage scenerio. In bomb scenerio the terrorist are trying to plant the bomb on site A or site B and the counter terrorist are trying to stop them. In hostage the counter terrorist are trying rescue the hostages while the terrorist are trying to stop the counter terriost. Both gamemodes are fun and require strategy and map awarness. The competitive match making system makes it easy to hop in with friends or your clan and find a match fast with eneimies around your skill level. The gameplay is very smooth. The shooting mechanics are one my favorites parts on this game with a pretty big emphasis on recoil and headshots compared to other fps games. A downside to this game is the visual element. It's not bad it is playable just not the best the game could look seeing how it was released in 2012. Counter Strike has a decent community most people are open to new players and will give them tips to help them out. I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy competitive fps games. If you enjoy this game you will most likely find yourself pouring countless hours into this game to improve your skill. I rate this game a 9.8/10
K R U S H Y;-;Pretty Neat.
LeeFe;-;Plays a lot like 1.6, weapons shoot true to life, many modes to choose from so as not to be easily bored. ++++
Tiddlelick the frog;-;Lavina, Justina, Lesqueesha and the tribe folk of the robinson family recomend this game. we never gove up our land in the dream time and we don't in csgo were fighting for a treaty, rainbow serpant looks down to us in grace and feeds us and supplys us spears. barramundi/10 = good tucker.
njugurpls;-;Fun to play with friends, @ classic competitive plays a lot of cheaters, but still, i love it. <3

-SNiGS- Hawkeye;-;Its worth the price to hear the AWPers  and moan when you kill them with an Auto-Sniper
NexxiT;-;I recommend this game very much, it's a funny game specially the match making ( competitive ) where go ranked when you are winning matches :)
Toni;-;the best game
Samp;-;INSANE game, very enjoyable to play, more fun is if you play competive or ESEA with your friends. Recommend to buy it, definitely worth buying this game.
tinkle_fingers;-;great game glad christian told me about this
GreeNVenom;-;Best CS that I ve ever played :D
Ernesto.;-;Great Game. Fun to play with others. Hard at first but you soon get the hang of it. Highly recommend.
....;-;It's a really good version of Counter-Strike. Probably my favourite! The weapons are far more balanced, there are more reasons to use grenades other then flashbangs and the gameplay on the whole feels more refined! It's still Counter Strike to it's core, but it shows Valve isn't afraid to risk  off their fanbase to release a new one. Good Job!
FPS Eager;-;Best shooter ever!! . . . . Terrorists Win!
I EAT WOLF FOR DINNER;-;One of the best games I've played in my life. 100% buy this game, worth every single cent.
AyEB;-;I shoot bullets at a person, and they die from it. Sometimes they do not. Sometimes they shoot me. Very deep storytelling.
Single^Shadow;-;I Love CS.go Very Much =)
I.P.Freely;-;---------Sadly i have to edit my review-------------- Im playing this game now for just too long to understand the core thinking of the makers of the game. Sadly i have to give the game a thumbs up anyway because the thumbs up are maybe for the best 1st person shooting game of all time... i played them all fromcs begginings till now even COD, BF probably all versions till now. But i have to admitt all this games cannot top CS:GO. Cs is just a very fast, team oriented 1st person shooter that will pull you in and never let go... Atleast what i thought so till now... Now i have to come to the problem... and the problem is: --------------------------------------------------CHEATING--------------------------------------------------------------------- Since the game came out i knew there would be cheaters... It sadly now belongs to almost every online game there is... But this became different... Allredy at the beggining i was wondering about the price of the game ... found it kinda cheap for such a good game only 14 Euro or something... At that point i allready thougt that its kinda easy for cheaters to rebuy a new account even if they should get banned... But i could never ever even imagine that it gets even better untill i realized that its beeing sold atleast once a month for ca 3 Euro... I dont know if this is aa dream or a insult to all the players who want to play a clean game... i dont think i have to explain what consequences this had on cheating.... So because of that the complainments and reports pilled up and valve was searching for a solution that doesnt cost them a thing and they get the cheaters atleast a lil bit under controll... so they made OVERWATCH... now they dont have to pull a finger and they work is beeing done by slaves (Players) who are hoping on a cleaner game one day... Nice story but whats this the game costs 3 Euro again so this guy (Cheater) buys this time 6 accounts so he has resources now for atleast 4 months to play and cheat... This is getting out of control VALVE you are making allready big money with this Skins and Market stuff why in Gods name cant you spent some of the money for making the game more enjoyable where you bann those cheaters and get us ----------------128-tick------------ SERVERS----------!!!!!! If these arogant stance of yours wont change you will loose probably a lot of players... I am a very active player but i quited the game for almost 2 moths last year because of that...
Mass232;-;The best tactical shooter in the mulitiplayer scene. CS:GO offers a game where uses and tactics are endless. This game has a massive learning curve, one like no other game, but once you overcome this, get ready for some tactical owning awesomeness... some people do counsider CS 1.6 and CSS as better games but that is personal opinions.
ASVP Luka *SteelSeries;-;Thank to my friend DarkWolf i get this game :) ty bro <3
marioJfreaKajin;-;Great game, endless fun. If you haven't already, buy this game at once! Every cent is worth it! 10/10! Fave game!
Kosakey es key 2 my heart;-;This game have chicken. 11/10 better than Battlefield and Call of Duty Series.
Alesso;-;Probably Best Counter Strike ever made. I only tried it after 2 years of coming out but i have to say i made a mistake. if i know i would buy it even earlier. Skins for the wapons are also a great idea from valve.
Freak Unleashed;-;Always been a Counter-Strike fan, played them all and this is my favorite one by so far and this brought me back to the series after a long break. Absolutely love the competetive matchmaking to find players to almost equal skill level as you and the feature to party up with your friends and play a game (casual or competetive) with them. And the "new" game modes are also fun and the fact that you can search official CS servers and the community made ones. The game is good, but they need to buff the shotties a little bit (except the Mag-7) cause I'm tired of getting 80-98 damage point blank (espacially with the Nova)! Shotties are made to kill with one shot or medium damage with fast followup shots. :c (okay rant part is over) Summary: I love this game alrdy even tho only 70 hours in the bank, but it has its problems like every game out there. If you like fps games and/or Counter-Strike give this game a try and be brave and try out the competetive matchmaking too! :3
Zorder;-;I just noticed that I haven't recommended this yet. Well, not much to say eitherways. It's not like it's my favourite online FPS of all time or anything! I never played much of the previous games of the franchise but I think I can safely say that CS: GO is a huge improvement in comparison to the previous games, not only in terms of graphical fidelity but also in terms of gameplay, map design, weapon design and overall everything. You know how Valve is eitherways, even though it was Hidden Path Entertainment who developed CS: GO I believe Valve still has some saying on how they did it and how they keep on improving it. The game still is regularly updated, mostly due to community feedback and competetive gamers and profissional players feedback and suggestions. They not only keep optimizing the maps but also they keep tweaking each weapon which is both good and bad, it's mainly bad because it will take some time to get used to how the gun works post patch. I only have some small complaints about the game, the matchmaking system and the hit registration on servers seems to be pretty bad, I've heard from other people that in LAN games CS: GO hit registrations are perfect, one of the best, if not the best out there. Other than that I'm hyped to see how the game will progress and how the hardcore community will react to future updates. Counter Strike: Global Offensive is obviously not a game for everyone, if you're looking for a casual experience you're better off playing Call of Duty or Battlefield, CS: GO requires time, practice and skill. That said, I cannot recommend this game enough, I simply love it.
Sensational;-;Most Addicted GAME EVER
Takoyaki!;-;this game is awesome :D
_Bubinaators_;-;Awesome,one of the worlds most played FPS,all must have this game,its just great and fun time!
h4ckY;-;It's nice and awesome for me :) Competitive play sometimes can be unpleasant because of cheaters or communication issue with your team. There are many good/decent players and sadly, more than few bad apples. If you find the team for you it's awesome :)
McLovin';-;Alright, so here it is... Counter-Strike: a game where you shoot people. Counter-Strike Condition Zero: a game where you shoot people, but this time it has a single-player option. Counter-Strike Source: a game where you shoot people, but with a slight graphical update and ragdoll physics. And Counter-Strike Global Offensive: A game where you shoot people, has a graphical update and ragdoll physics, and DOESN'T SUCK! 4 Rootin' Tootin' McLovin's out of 5
TeslaStop;-;If you're an american and like counter striking on a global stage, this is your offensive, or be a terrorist and bomb random unknown locations.-IGN 7/10 Not like call of duty
L0cK;-;The game is actually the old cs 1.6 with the new graphic. I recommend to everyone ho had played cs 1.6 to try cs:go 10+ for game :)
haha;-;Such a good game I do not know whats so bad about it, yes the recoil has changed but I'm pretty sure its easy to get used to! Good game definetely want you to get this!!!
Zen;-;An endless cycle of getting mad and quitting the game after playing some competitive.
Sandromin;-;Like mere sheep, all the dirty casuals shall fall into a hole and suffer at the hands of a cruel God. REPENT!

So, come my peers, let thou see for thineself what Cunter Strike Global Dust II is all about: the underaged s, the dirty s, and the euphoric bronies. Ah, it is a place of autism and down syndrome, glorious to the core. Ye shall find yourself in a dark hole in which the only escape is the light of Coonter Struck: Global AWPfensive.- Book of Gaben III, 8:19-23
BOT Philip J. Fry;-;nice game with more realistic and logic gaming sense applied..
BrutalCS | Headpiker;-;Very, very good game! A must-buiy for any serious gamer!
Bacon_Defender;-;seriously fun. no other shooter out there has such a high skill ceiling to a point where there is always room for improvement and always some one better then you. csgo adds a true competitive nature to the world of first person shooters that no other shooter can clame to obtain. +++++ thumbs up!
VironBR;-;This review is in "English/Portuguese" English: This is Counter-Strike! Do i need to say something else? BUY IT! No, seriously, this game is awesome, a survivor of the old shooters, were skill, aim and care is the most imporant things you can have, well, actually most important thing here is teamwork... and flashbangs... Portuguese: Isso  Counter-Strike! Preciso falar mais alguma coisa? COMPRE! No, srio, este jogo  demais, um sobrevivente dos velhos shooters, onde habilidade, mira e cuidado so as coisas mais imporantes que voc pode ter, bom, na verdade a coisa mais importante  trabalho em equipe... e flashbangs...
Wild Hunt 1.06;-;Pew-pew-pew!!! I tried going competitive and like really focus on improving, didn't actually go so well for me but great game though. My friends are crazy over this and it is really fun to watch. FPS taken to a whole new level, realistic and requires real skill. You say you've played "insert fps game here" and say you are good, really good? Well don't get your hopes up because you suck here! Mechanics are good, game play is good, learning curve is not that complicated, you just need a lot of practice. Like a lot. P.S. Always carry a defusal kit.. or take from a dead teammate.
ASAPskippy;-;I've created a strong love for this game, there is something about it to where it doesn't get boring because there's always a great feeling making big plays and being in a 1v3, having your heart racing and being extremely excited you just want more. Im here to say this game is not for everyone but if you want to get into it this is the time. There's always plenty of new players flowing in and learning the game. There are some things that really will ruin your experience and that would be cheaters. Don't be a cheater its good to know the game and gain the skill insteasd of using hacks to improve gameplay. But when you get a truly good match its 15-15 you know you want to win and its super tense thats when you get a love for the game. But if i were you i would truly try to stay away from matchmaking once your past eagle simply because there's to many cheaters and its gotten worse of the years. so i highly recommend deathmatching alot play matchmaking while your unranked or a silver for practice. learn angles, spray control, nade flash spots, team flashing tends to happen alot make sure you avoid that was much as possble. But i highly recommend this game its countless hours of fun expecially with your friends. But the number one rule is never give up your going to die alot there's always going to be better players then you thats why you indure your lack of skill and set a goal to be better then those other players. Also always be positive while doing a competitive matchmake never say good game (gg) just because you lost 3 rounds in a row that kills your attitude and your teams! Which will only guarentee a loss. Also have good sportsmanship like, nice shot (ns), good luck have fun (glhf), good half (gh). And remember this games a learning curve so never give up! because you will excel at the game at some point. So just jeep deathmatching learning map calls gaining game sense and learning angles and NEVER let someone bring you down ignore people who trash talk and make you feel like . always stay positive because you will be big someday... you've just got to own it.
Teh RoSE;-;CS:GO is love, CS:GO is life.
Sch0rsch;-;Counter-Strike's newborn. Weapon handling and Movement are nearly perfect. No Aiming down Sights (besides the Sniperrifles) and really hard Recoil/Bulletspread that you can learn to control. It has a hard learning curve but after some time you can get the hang of it. The competitve Matchmaking is really easy to use and you get most of the time people who are in your skill group. After 10 competitive wins you get thrown into a skillgroup. Now you can rank up or get downranked, depends on your skill ingame. You can collect Skins for you weapons. They don't have a advantage. There are some skins called Stattrak that you can just get through opening cases with a key. They have a little killcounter on the weapon that well, count your kills that you made with that weapon. Cases can drop , just like skins, after a match. (BUT NO AFTER EVERY MATCH AND THERE IS A DROP LIMIT PER WEEK!) If you really want a fancy dandy skin, like a M4A4 Asiimov or a special knife(rarest thing you can get) you can either gamble and open cases with bought keys, buy your favourite skins on the Steam market or use the trade-up contract. With the contract (that you can find in your Global offensive inventory ingame) you can trade 10 weapons from one collection for a new better quality weapon from that collection.
cheeky banter with the lads;-;Its a classic. ive sunk way too many hours into this game and i will continue too. Its frustrating, its a brutal game that will tell you when you're crap and when you're good. Its a great game with some good communities. Its only 15 dollars. Its a must have for any gamer that likes a good FPS. This along with the previous cs games are the king of the FPS.
DarsA;-;When it was First Released 'Counter-Strike' in few days it was so popular then they Created it on new Engine more realistic movememnts and realitic physics, and two years ago they came to Here Counter Strike Global Offensive which is serious game compared to its older versions, it have Clans , Competetive gaming and also Weapons which are in every COlor. 10/10
KylePhoenix;-;What else can I say, CS:GO just got better and better since the first time I played it. I just love it!
Chinea I HAVE INTERNET GOD BLE;-;I'd like to take a moment and thank Gaben, our Lord and Savior for this masterpiece of a vidya gaimes. Without Volvo there would be no human race or League of Sona's . You are the best father any yordle could ever ask for. Thank you. Amen.

f1zzarp;-;best game of all time! been playing for over ten years and still cant get enough of it
vREZ;-;Love the competitive mode added to this already wondeful game! A really great add to the previous game CS:S!
boRDo;-;Counter Strike is a very nice game Each game has its advantages but also its disadvantages Advantages: You have many options to play Counter Strike. You can make competitions, can be played on normal and abnormal funny servers You get temporarily weapons or boxes that you can use in the game Disadvantages: Disadvantages include the Steam or Valve occasionally have problems with the servers ..... It has also cheaters who get nothing in life to the series and want to achieve something in the game Although it has more pros and cons but I think that's enough I recommend it to anyone but do not become addicted;) So have fun with it
SpankMyDoodle;-;Really good game, im just not good at it
Brajant;-;What to say about this game, everything is on a much higher level than CS 1.6, you can't compare that two games at all. Playing it everyday, mostly 95% in competitive matches with my friends. Recommended.
TopShelfOwen;-;I love this game so much. But I have some ideas for other names Negev Simulator AWP Simulator Auto Sniper Simulator Blame People of Hacking Simulator. But Counter-Strike is good I guess. Buy this game now
Rey;-;Obvious as it is - this game is next part of legendary "Counter-Strike" series. Would recommend to everyone, who previously played CS 1.6 or CS:S. With lots of graphical improvements, this game still has it's atmosphere of CS. Lots of new maps, workshop content, weapon skins, different stream and competetive matchmaking (5v5) with ranking system will keep you entertained all the time. Higly recommend it. ;)
Cardboardimus CSGOFAST;-;You can name your guns anything you want. AWP= The JFK Experience. 11/10

saimu;-;Game gave me testicular torsion. Couldn't get to the hospital fast enough because I was in a compettive game and didn't want to leave. Lost both of my testicles.
Rage;-;Counter Strike Global Offensive was by far my favorite CS game. The only downside to it is the fact that it doesnt provide GMOD textures :P

arte et labore.;-;initially seemed pretty bad, actually turns out to be pretty fuxing awesome. on a sidenote; something has to be done about all the hackers in competitive matchmaking as it really ruins the otherwise amazing game
only scout the nazo bravo;-;Game is full of swag - but I suck at it.
AquaMonkey;-;This game will make you cry because of the damn 64 tickrate. It will make you throw the object next to your left hand out of the window. It will make you laugh because your friend will get 360 noscoped by a teammate. But whatever happens, you will come back. You will pwn people, dominate them, and get the most beloved Global Elite rank. You will comprehend the euphoric feelings when you get the next rank. Unless you're a skrub. In that case just uninstall.
JeT;-;very fun whould purchase ;)
Ella;-;It is just amazing!
Banksy;-;Like Skyrim with guns and chickens and spicy memes. 5/5

*Mr.Morning*;-;i freaking love this game i would never stop playing if i could graphics are tops sound is tops weapons are tops this is one of my favorite games ever!
Rooster3m^v^64;-;This game has one of the best communities out there by far! Most teams actually talk and try to communicate with each other to win.

Casualstone Player;-;Mac-10 needs to be buffed. 10/10.
Coco;-;Definitely way better than other web FPS's
Daitor;-;The newest addition in the Counter Strike series. Counter Strike remains one of the few first person shooters that features a tremendous skillgap, both for individual play and for cordinating with your team. Playing the classic competitive gamemode truly demands you play at your best... If you want to climb in the ranks, of course. CS:GO has a pretty decent ranking system that pits you against players of your skill level. Fear not, new player. While the precise aiming, timing your movement with your shots and the recoil patterns of the main rifles are difficult to learn at first, once you start controlling them, you will be greatly rewarded. You will notice you will systematically become better than the newer players. At that point, the game starts to become addictive; getting headshots left and right is just so satisfying. In my opinion, anyone who calls himself a competitive first person shooter player should play Counter Strike and invest some time in it. There's really no other shooter quite like it.
Die in Style;-;Here's where I'd put my stamp of approval. IF I HAD ONE!
ingzTrue22 (TGL);-;Another great FPS that has more to choose from and do then all the Counter-Strikes. With the added skins for weapons it makes the game worth the effort and time to play! Love the game and I approve of getting it I'm happy I did!!!!
logainz;-;"i like the bit where the guns shoot people" - 6/10
rune;-;This is the new game of the award winning COUNTER STRIKES You play as a terrorist like Bin-Laden or a counter-terrorist who counters the terrorists. You buy guns and shoot the enemy until they're dead or the terrorists plant the bomb. There are different gamemodes though!!! Such as gun game where you shoot someone and your gun transforms IN YOUR HANDS into another gun and you shoot more. Good game
Dr0id 1;-;When you get the time or have the money I highly recommend you buy this game. If you like to game and haven't bought a Counter Strike game you really haven't played most games. This game is casual and competitive so it suits every type of fps player, and like every valve game you can have custom servers if you don't want to play deathmatch, hostage mission or demolition. From the 300 some hours i've played on this game I'd say it was worth the money. -Droid 1-
`0p' FLG;-;CS at its best.one of the best FPS games ever.

Shiro ~;-;Very good game. I recommend for those rich kids that want to show that they can afford skins.
~Kakuzu~;-;Really nice game one of the best FPS i ever played :D
Keeper-Outcast;-;Hands down best online fps out there. Yes, its exctremly archaic. Yes, there is nothing but shooting and economy involved. Yes, it has a hight learning curve. Still, the amount of skill, teamplay and tactical awareness it provides is unparalleled. Thats it, now go and kill something.
Dolphin.exe;-;As much as i love this game there still is a lot of issues with this game that stops me from playing half the time. 1. cheaters 2. smurfs 3. tick issues 4. bad community this game is worth playing on community servers but really frustrating and challenging to play competitive games, but overall this game is still fun to play and its well made game play wise. ps. don'd get sunk into buying keys :P

Revan The Bleeding Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

ChipFlexes -S- ICA;-;CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) is an (Online) First Person Shooter game. The game is very simular to the other Counter-Strike games out there, but this one is special, it has new maps, new types of playstyle, a great community & ofcourse skins. It's basically the type of game that you could play for hours and still never get bored of it (thanks to a growing community, new maps etc.) This game isn't a hardcore ''MLG-Pro 720 NoScope'' Simulator like Call of Duty (No offense to the CoD community) This is basically an awesome game. Now to the part why you should buy it.. As I wrote before, you could play for hours and still enjoy it. This game is not too expensive yet not too cheap. It could get expensive, if you get into buying skins and such, but that's just your choice. GAMEPLAY: Gun sounds are good you could recognize every gun, and pretty realistic. (Atleast in my opinion) Sound quality is good, especially if you have good quality headphones. (Footsteps etc. is good to listen to for improved gameplay) Aiming and such is very diffrent to other games but is easy to master if you change your crosshair and your sensitivity to what you like and feel comfortable with. ________________________________________________________ Overall a very good game. Worth the money. 9.8/10 - ChipFlexes

Aidinho;-;This game is fun to play, and takes alot of skill to master and therefore consumes alot of time. CSGO is cheaper than alot of FPS games (CoD & Battlefield) and in my opinion i get alot more out of this game.
Zatic;-;This game is amazing i love it and just now i did a Ninja defuse Its ghood fun best with friends :D
Hypaspists *ACES;-;What is the game about: In Counter Chicken: Global Strike, there is an infestation of chickens, who inhabit such areas as German nuclear facilities, or at medieval castle sites. This minigame has become a primary game mechanic, as any player whom dedicates their time spent online killing these chickens and helping Volvo slow their respawn rates, you get a flip knife slaughter called 'PETA', which can be sold on the community marketplace. What else does the game offer: Also in Chicken Global: Counter Strike, the secondary minigame is the 'competitive' mode. In this mode, players are put in teams of 5 to combat eachother, and test their ability to kill chickens by killing eachother. You get assessed and ranked on your ability to kill chickens in this mode. Verdict: i r8 8/8 gr8 b8 no h8 its just l8
Dogmatic;-;i hate this game, 10/10
monkeyrider00;-;This is good FPS game. This game contains alot of in-game-purchases; Weapon crate keys etc. I would recommend this game to anyone who like FPS games. 9/10
DC Grimsta;-;Best game I've played! :)
Uncle Pain;-;At first this game seems like a childish shooter, some relate it to Call of Duty with no aim action.However it is much more than that! With a harsh rank system and a rather tactical gameplay which for most will take weeks to master it becomes a game you can no longer put down. You may get killed by a P90 10,000 round mag  and say you wil never play this game ever again, (trust me I've been there) however if it's on competitive you cannot leve therefore it forces you to play more. This may lead you to get a 3-4 killstreak destroying the P90  and all his littel elves. This gives you the courage to carry on and may even win this godfosaken match which you've now lost 2 stone over trying to get round corners without becoming a human target. However if you use teamwork and dont spray and pray, and trust me there's a lot of praying in this game! You may win your first few matches, therefore leading onto your love for the game. missed every single bullest with the AWP, pulls out pistol gets a headshot and kills him 10/10
SAS Pure Rapp;-;Ok i change my mide CS:GO is one of the bast FPS game i have every play but there still the macth makeing thing that place you in a game with batter ppl that the only con i found.Othere there that the game play is good how the gun fire is good. the only thing that is sad is that if you do bad for a round everyone call you a Nood and if you do good in a round and you kill i lot of player on the other team thay we star calling you a hack . So good luck and have fun and CSGO

ToxicRabbit;-;read reviews about killing chickens, thought it was a hunting simulator, very dispointing 1/10
LongBarrel is kewl;-;This game has a unique variety of weapons and 2 teams. Guns, Technical Equipment - this game has everything. Very coooool weapon skins as well :)
Destroyer;-;I strongly recommend this game for everyone! especially the CS series loves. This game is like the fullon upgraded vesion of cs1.6... wait a minute CSGO is much better than CS1.6 plus steam skins make this game more beautiful ^_^

Ripperonies;-;Its sooper fun.
Mayonnaise;-;This is one of the most AWESOME GAMES EVER MADE
Frektel;-;Great first person shooter, no doubt.YOU CAN KILL CHICKENS Muahaha CHICKEN SIMULATOR 2033 Now something serious tho, There is no support from other players whatsoever, for example when you join a competative match there is no one who helps out a new player, all they can say is "suka" blyat and any other russian/slavic language lel. And when you're last alive ofcourse, your whole team judges every move you make. and when you get into a 1v5 clutch situation you get rekt from behind.. Don't forget the votekick system, they don't like newbies. So prepare to get kicked within 1.5 seconds on a competative match, I do recommend it but pls go play 200 casual b4 you join any competative match, OR YOU COULD JUST BE AN IGNORANT C*** AND DON'T LISTEN TO ALL THE BULL**** I JUST WROTE, JUST JOIN A IN COMPATEIV MATCH AND LEAN ON YOUR VOICE CHAT KEY AND SPAM DARUDE SANDSTORME AND CHEEKI BREEKI ALL OVER DA ING DE_DUST 2 MAP, WHY? CUZ YOU CAN!  OF OTHER PEOPLE AND TRY TO STAY IN GAME WITHOUT GETTING KICKED. AND IF THAT AIN'T ENOUGH ALL THE RUSSIAN SWEARING WILL EVENTUALLY GIVE YOU EYE CAN**R. OH EHH TRY TO BUY AN AWP AND TEAMKILL YOUR FRIENDM8'S AND YOU EVENTUALLY START TO THINK THAT YOU ARE FUNNY FOR TROLLING PEOPLE. ENJOY THE VACBANS LADY'S C:
GruM;-;Can't play with friends becouse their rank is either too high, making me feel like garbage, or too low, making me compete against 10 year olds. I don't want to shoot to kids in CS, that's what CoD is for. Random team is either Russians, most of them cannot team play [ ] Either Korean, so I end up with stats 0/0 or Arabian, I cannot play with somebody who sounds so funny Either Way 9/10, If you're lucky
lebidufe(leo) ( ~  );-;Nice and classic game <3
Du3lRab 1310;-;CS:go is a fast paced action game with many modes, many skins, many knives, and alot of Competitive players trying to go for the top of the hill. Back when I was involved in the beta, there were few players that I knew, but alot of great enhancments from 1.6 and Source. It did take a while to get used to the new engine, but as I progressed into the game, I got used to the new hitboxes. The Arms Deal Update - this update introduced new ways to customize your weapons with different items from either map packs, collections, or tournament events. Trying to get the rarest can sometimes get easy or rare, cheap or expensive. Knives are hard to get, but also are some of the Covert rifles. Why do I enjoy this game? I am able to play with many other players of similar skill and more of the updates are helping making this game alot better with the Reddit community having a voice.
AgentPancakes;-;First shooter I ever had to learn how to play. 8/10 The Russians expect everyone in the team to speak russian
Jay;-;A great FPS game. very competitive and intense!
Ducky;-;I can miss a player by a distance of 1m by taking one step to the right while shooting 10/10 would expose myself and get rekt again
Raggamuffin;-;One of the best fps games ever! Pretty cheap also, a very good choice!
Tumezzi;-;10/10. You can juggle with Desert Eagles
TheLastEpic1;-;Skins are love, skins are life. Be prepared to rage at this game whenever someone 1 hit headshots you at the start of a round.

Reecey;-;So fun to play , especially with friends definatly recommend it. :D
Patrick;-;Counter Strike : Global Offensive is a very community based game to me and really proved to be a great game and community centred.
No1s Perfect;-;This game lets me shot chickens. 11/10
Ever1x;-;This game will suck u in!
Bobby.G.Johnson;-;A lot of chikens here. Also russians. I rep
Flexi;-;The only game where you greatly value what your gun looks like instead of how good you are using it.
Si,Baby;-;First time playing CS in general. No matter what people say about the CSGO community.... sigh.... I just keep coming back. If you get lucky you're a hacker or a smurf. If you headshot deagle you're a cheater. Everyone's favorite thing to say when you're on the losing team : "Enjoy your ban in hacker!" Everyone's favorite thing to say when you're on the winning team: " Get ." Arguments in CSGO : 1. "You're sh** , enjoy your rank up fa* " *when you're a higher rank and they are silver* 2. "Add my main if you think I'm a hacker." *When you're on an alt account and everyone is calling you a hacker* 3."I play on ESEA KID , get on my level." *self explanatory* 4."How did you shoot me through the smoke? HACKER." *rant continues back and forth about how the shot was made* 5."Good job DDOS noobs you knew you can't win against us. Keep blaming valve" *When out of nowhere every other round is being DDOS and the losing team catches up and wins* 6."Ya'll gonna get rekt guys gg, hf" *warmup round other team is being cocky, arguments in chat back and forth * 7. "I'm done with this game .... stupid broken fu***** game ." * when your team mate gets shot and complains * Overall this is the best game ever and I love the community. Dont hesitate buying this . United we stand hackers,smurfs,noobs,fraggers.
NeegorNooger;-;For $16.99 you get the following... -Free Russian language classes -Free lessons about "real" gun spray patterns -Voulenteer hours as you now participate in silver daycare -Real life knowledge about the impact grenades do -And FREE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE CLASSES! For $16.99 value doesn't get better than this. 10/10 must buy
El Toupet;-;This game taught me russians have no access to teamspeak so they use the ingame voicechat instead. It also seems like they arent taught any other languages or simply refuse to talk english with the rest of their completely nonrussian team. 10/10 Would k urwa again.
SpeedlPN;-;It's a really good tactical shooter. YOU MUST BUY IT!
Choco;-;The best Valve game ever created. rly
[AoG]CrazyChocolateChipDaddy39;-;Valve Hasn't dissapointed me in 14 years of playing Counter Strike, Counter Strike Source, and now Counter Strike Global Offensive. This is another great title, that will keep the community of Counter Strike Enthusists entertained as long as the franchise has exsisted. If you have seen the rest, CS has never dissapointed, where to start, the awesome drops you receive from competitive or from playing on community servers out there, new skins. The Ultra rare Butterfly knife skin is what lots are looking for. Overwatch is the newest and best system out there to keep out the cheaters who think they can win at all costs, I am glad that Overwatch is out there, I can't wait til it branches out to all Counter strike series. Play CSGO and you will enjoy it.
CritZz;-;Awsome game!
Sancho;-;its ok
shrimpy;-;This game... is something else. You WILL start as a rookie. You will NOT be a pro in a few weeks. Hell, not even in a few months, but once you learn how to play this game properly and master it, you WILL enjoy it. This game does not only require gun skill however, 90% of this game is TEAMWORK. Yes, you will need FRIENDS to play this game with, otherwise you'll be stuck with... other people that scream  KURWA NOOB over the voice chat and you will most likely lose those games. So get some friends, start up CS:GO, go practice and have some fun! Oh yeah, you can also buy keys to unbox crates and possibly get items worth more than they are IRL. Great game. 9/10
Frichris;-;In two words: Great game. The controls aren't complicated, the works of the game aren't complicated yet they always pose a challenge. Sick of spraying and seeing CoD noobs run past and kill you to just sprint off again? Play Counter Strike.. if you run and gun here you'll miss 99.9% of your clip and get shot right in the kisser.
Phoenix;-;Government makes people defending country pay for their own weapons, BRILLIANT Government sends soldiers with no idea how to control recoil into battle, learn from the expierence! BRILLIANT But, let's throw a molotov at a wall and see it bounce off, but explode in the air hmmmmmmm Let's send in the exact number of people as the enemy! BRILLIANT enough said, buy this game, its the best thing youll ever play :D 999999/10 BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stormlord;-;My friend told me to buy this game when i was playing another game on my computer. That game was pretty sweet, I played it for 2 hours. He's bad though so I'm not enjoying it, but it's not the game it's him. Then he bought the game for another friend and he's even worse, but that's okay because we can play against worse people with him. After a while my friend bought the game for another friend but he doesn't play it that much (he has 7 competitive wins lol wat a loser). This game is fun but the bullets dont fly where you want them too, which is bad. Valve please fix. I gave this game to my brother and he won't give it back, if you know a good way to give back game will you tell me plz? Thanks, I give this game a 9/11, buy you must (lel im like that green guy from the starwars). Can't live without.
ELL.;-;i suck at this game 10/10
Pogmeister;-;It's progressively ruining my life. But at the same time, I'm getting a lot better at FPS games. Buy it at your own caution of addiction and rage.
wadirim;-;Best Counter Strike game in my opinion. Just pure awesomeness! Much recommend, so amze, wow!
UnforgivenCaleb;-;I played this game a little on the Xbox and couldn't really get into it. Then I played it on PC... and now I'm hooked. Admittedly, I'm not very good at this game, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying it. My new go-to online FPS.
Astronaut;-;Classic action, refined and improved!
Mobbste;-;Better than Source.
Lyrekem;-;My teeth were clenched, like how my fingers were clenched on the handle and forestock of my AWP that I had scavenged. Earlier, I had paused to admire the blue-ish purple honeycombs on the sniper rifle. Now, I no longer cared about how my weapon looked like. As long as it could fire a projectile fast enough to end the life of my target, I was satisfied. The fiend was still shooting. His battle cry was fresh in my ears. As was the sound of the bomb, the timer ticking away. His IMI Negev pelted the gap in the wall with dozens of bullets, each one threatening to take my head off. That sorry fate had happened to my comrades, who laid dead on the ground with 5.56x45mm bullets in their still corpses. I was the last one. I could avenge my comrades, defuse the bomb, and emerge a hero... Or I could die. I looked for other options. Leaving the bomb was not an option. Going through the double doors would only sign my death certificate, as my late-teammates proved. I had to do it. The Terrorist's gun had a high rate of fire, but it was inaccurate at such a range. It was the only gamble that I could take. A mental clock timed down in my head. Three...two...ONE. I bolted through the gap, but not all the way. I brought up my rifle, staring through the scope at the madman who continued to shoot haphazardly. His bullets were flying around. I felt a searing gash of heat on my thigh, and knew I was hit once. But it would not save the murderer. My crosshairs now laid upon his chest, which was drenched with sweat and stained with the blood of men. My finger, already closed around the trigger, squeezed it. The shot rang out, and the .338 Lapua Magnum round tore through the air and into the Terrorist's chest, ending his life instantly. I lowered my rifle, panting heavily. I had no time to celebrate. I looked down at the planted bomb, less than 10 seconds away from igniting. I leapt down from the boxes, landing squarely on my feet. I had cast away the AWP, pulling out my Defusal Kit instead. I gripped the pliers, and squatted down. My fingers reached for the bomb, closing around it. I eased the pliers between the wire, hearing the beeping get faster and faster. I squeezed my right hand tight, and the beeping stopped. I fell back on my backside, dropping the pliers as I took massive gulps of air. This was the ninth operation I took part in. And the ninth one that I emerged alive. That was my story, depicting my recent Competitive game on Dust 2. Yes, the AWP was the Electric Hive skin. Yes, it was at B. If you want a summary of a good round of CSGO, there it is. If you want my rating of the game, here it is. 10/10, would play again for every day for the next 3 years (Get what I am implying, Valve? Where is my HL3? xD). EPILOGUE =D Alarms blared in the dormitory. I quickly did up my uniform, lacing up my boots and reaching for my Heckler and Koch P2000 and my Knife. As I slid them into the holster and the sheath, I could feel the adrenaline rushing in. My tenth operation. I pulled my balaclava on, followed by my helmet. My mind began racing, thinking about what would happen, should I be able to return from this. I would be assessed by the Board and designated to a squad. I had spent many nights, dreaming about the moment. Of course, to reach that moment, I would have to come out of this operation alive. And I was going to come out of it alive. I will survive. Not just survive. I will win.
zman (_);-;Amazing, Nuff Said.
GeorgeCantSnipe;-;I used to like this game. It's funny because I'd rather Team Fortress 2 over this now. Ever since late 2014-Now , Cs:GO is full of toddlers , teens saying how they're better than you and you are  , people unboxing on youtube screaming "GABEN,GABEN Oh Please GABEN!" To the point where it's not even funny and cringe-worthy. And not to mention a handful of 'gamer girls' on Twitch unboxing and playing the game just for money. Nowadays you probably can't get put into a game without some kid with a Five Nights At Freddys picture , some kid screaming "Praise Gaben" into the mic and people with a $1,000 Inventory and they're not even good at the game. Even when you go competitive and you are going to get harassed by the other team and called a hacker when you get good shots or are better than them. Before people actually complimented them getting a nice kill or an ace , now it's just "HACKER , LOL ENJOY THE VAC BRO LOLOL". And if the other team end up getting a nice kill on you it's just " LOLOLO GET REMT , REKT U  !! GET GOOD AT THE GAME REMT REMT REMT REMT!!". But the game itself is actually really good and has nice guns,map designs and mechanics. But the community itself is slowly turning into a cross of Call Of Duty and Team Fortress 2. TL;DR : Cs:GO community is , but game is good.
Hidden-Maverick;-;Worth the money.
Super Amazing Asian Man;-;You get to shoot people, but you don't get to wear hats.

You want some?;-;If you like FPS and strategy games this is the one for you!
DreadCorp;-;High energy, diverse community, and a glorious history are but a few terms one may use to describe the Counter Strike series. Global Offensive takes the CS game back to the forefront of FPS Gaming with updated graphics, weapon customizations, and an overall remodeling of the game mechanics. CS:GO is well worth the purchase and is a welcome addition to the Valve developed game library. Time to pick up that Negev and say a few Hail Marys.

Scuffy;-;probably the most balanced fps game as it requires actual skill to do well, spray and prayers will get a bit of luck, but against good opponents they will lose. A lot of fun for competitive.

MySykoMind;-;Great game! MM got russians and cheaters! Buy as many copies as you can, and send em to someones you hate! Cs:go got cool drops! (if you get any..............) Cases are fun ! It's so exciting to open 'em and get the scrab weapons!:) (key cost 1.80e) oh and also: OPERATIONS. Yeah! cs fans make maps, and valve adds 'em to the game and charge you about 1-2e per operation, and you get the coin of that operation how cool is that?! 1337/1337 ! Totally worth of all money you spend! :)

(not for pregnant women, people with a regular sense and people with raging problems) BUY IT AND GIVE LORD GABEN MORE IN MONEY!!!!!!!
Spiritofvengeance;-;Fun and Competitive game touching on the 1st person shooter aspects that we know and love.
AceSneezer;-;This game seems really easy, yet it is quite hard. From the start of the game I noticed that looking down sights on all weapons is a lost luxury. Hip firing and learning how to burst is the name of the game. It gets frustrating sometimes, but the game is an overall fun game. I recommend it 9/10.
Exodius;-;One of the best shooter game i've ever seen...
H47;-;The graphics are great.  It has all the good old maps.  Fun gameplay.  New guns.  Too many cheaters!  Too many kids with downloaded skill.  Too many pro's with 10-15hrs.
Camoviking;-;Very fun. One of my favourite games.
I Kill With Love;-;I recommend this game me and my friends play it everyday its a good use my time left over before i sleep XD
Kawaii;-;If CS:GO was a potato, it would be a good potato.

Hosing;-;i get headshot through walls, shotgunned across the map, sniped with a pistol, and get kicked for not clutching but i can taze the living  out of people which makes it all worth while 10/10
XTrigger  Trigger;-;Really good game. amazing engine. such smooth. so dynamic. very wow
chris white;-;A nice game to be playing if you want to argue with russians
Zeeman737;-;Don't be fooled by the price. It says $14.99, but eventually you will spend $300+. Ten out of ten game besides that fact the I lost MY FREAKING KNIFE FROM A SCAME- nevermind. If you are looking to not play any more games in the future, I recommend you to play this game. I have many hours on this game, and I don't regret it. Help. My family is looking for me and I don't want to leave my room.
King Kurtis;-;I am the track pad warrior
Gina Rinehart;-;Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield Men play ARMA And Weirdly enough, they all end up in CSGO
Adi12;-;An amazing Game for the Series.It is one of the best in the Counter Strike games.New Weapons, Amazing Graphics,New Gamemodes,And it has Ragdoll Physics!! Imagine if it doesn't have the physics.
LuRam;-;True fps e-sports spirit. Decent graphics. Same matchmaking system as DOTA 2, the game finally got the respect it deserved, If you lived the CS era started back in 97-98, you should already have bought that from yesterday
Panda;-;Don't buy keys. Seriously. Don't. Buy. Keys.
Goken;-;This game is real fast paced and fun if you have not played it I strongly recommend it.
Legend;-;A great, balanced shooter for anyone with a passion for FPS games.
McLovin';-;Yes, most expensive game I have played.
Pinball Wizard;-;Favorite current FPS but not all time. All of the game modes that the game offers are fun if you enjoy the game and often made updates to the game are satisfying (Operation packs). Aside from cheaters and griefers, who you'll come across surely, matchmaking is my favorite along side with Casual. Community servers offer a lot of fun maps and game modes as well such as: zombie; de_surf; de_rats; etc. The game offers a bonus mini-game which is called "Unboxing A Case". If you choose to play it you will often be left with disappointment and questions raised by your family such as "Where has all the money gone?". Some say the ecstasy you recieve from winning some of the rarest items in the game is worth the tears you cry after opening some of these cases. Legend says that by selling the most valuable item recieved from the "Unboxing A Case" game you'll have enough money to buy ever game on Steam. 10/10, would open more.
Medzin;-;10/10 Best team/tactic based FPS also aim and physics are good, Awesome shooter with great intense moments. Must have!
ConeSeer;-;This games in sick ay

ro7na;-;Best game in Steam for now.
Thatweirdguy's Hero;-;Pre-ordered the game during its first launching hours , this game was the next up coming game for the counter strike franchise as it was developed by valve and released in 2012, The game features new maps and weapons such as smg's such as the mp7 - mp5 and mp9 other pistols involves the tec-9 p250 , along with p200. Along many patches and updates comes more features and maps , one such as the past counter strike 1.6 and source , silencers were brought back along with classic weapons ( M4A1 - USP ). very recommended for favour fps shooters with its low prices , would be great to purchase it at half price $7.50 .!
John Cena;-;ing love it
Ms deFinitely;-;This state-of-the-art rage simulator immerses you in the front lines of true modern combat. The long-anticipated sequel to the popular Battlefield franchise, this gem features vivid, colorful graphics, a large assortment of carefully balanced weapons and original, never-before-seen maps such as de_dust and de_dust2. As a game of pure skill and strategy, CS:GO also includes a bonus Competitive Mode, where players worldwide can compete against Brazilians. The perfected Matchmaking system will assign new players to a random skill group and match them in a team with and against hackers and hardened Counter-Strike veterans, always resulting in a unique -raping experience. As an added bonus, players with poor internet connection will receive top priority in matchmaking. -Counter Strike Global Offensive in a nut shell

187;-;Nice game
Blxxor;-;Since I played 1.6 and stopped it, I thought I would never come back to a Counter-Strike game again.. I WAS WRONG! Saw the game on sale, flipped my  when I couldn't buy it when it was low and bought it at full price. 10/10 Anyway, it really brings the competitive scene that has been missing in Counter-Strike (for casual players). Matchmaking mode is really fun, especially when you get at least decent teammates. My friends list became twice larger ever since I started playing this game. I've had my laughs, I've had my cries in this game, but I still can't get enough of it. You constantly want to improve and get a bigger rank. There are also really good alternative versions of Matchmaking, called PUGS (Pick-Up Games). Really addictive for casual and competitive FPS players.
F0rc3ful;-;One of the best games ever. It's like CS:S + COD.
Bl1nk-_-;-;This is a hardcore game, one of the best, but. It is NOT for the casual gamer. It will destroy you if you are a casual. The only game worse in that regard is Unreal Tournament. On a positive note, it is one of the best games ever made. Period. You will not regret purchase, I will promise you that.
Chandan;-;Still proving what an aging source engine is capable of Counter strike global offensive delivers a fast paced skilled shooter that will keep you on your toes. Can't beat the price best bang for $ first person shooter available Final Score 8/10
Gen-Twitch.tv/Synthesizes;-;Do you want to yell at your computer and say "I SWAER I 1-TAPPED HIM. HE'S LIT 4 98!!@!@!@@12121." Then this is the game for you. It offers the best chicken slaughter simulator, and the best envy simulator for when you see those sick skins that people own. Or those Karambit fade StatTrak, and you say to yourself. "One day I'll trade up for a Karambit." Then two weeks later you buy it with your Mom's CC. Then this is the game for you.!!!

Black&White;-;First of all, note that graphon really managed. And not even in terms of the "cruisey" hi-endnote graphics, but in terms of quality of work of designers, mappers, modelers, and others. Because the maps look really good, modelki weapons and players are also good (that is, in fact, they just made qualitatively and of themselves are good, but look if they do well in this game is another question) - in short, graton I liked, despite the fact that generally Counter Strike is not a game where important grafon. At least, there is no such flatulence, excessive brightness, as in Source - graphon GO just a nice, where you have the gloomy, where it is bright. In General, good graton, normal, pleases the eye and the stars from the sky is not enough. And the map is very good. That is, as. Most of the maps in GO are copies of classic maps from 1.6. However, in contrast to the same Source environment and the design altered almost completely - if the Source just got my texture, added normal Sormovsky features like lying all over the map garbage, there is virtually completely redesigned the concept and idea cards, leaving almost intact the original structure of the map. For example, de_dust2. In 1.6 and Source is a common Eastern city with pointed domes and intricate paintings a La cartoons about Aladdin. In GO, this map looks like a very levels of some CoD 4, because now this is not the tale of Aladdin, but rather dilapidated streets of, say, Syria. In this respect GO a head taller than their predecessors, meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression.

In this respect GO a head taller than their predecessors, meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression. All salt that GO missing... Like to call it, nanowaste. 1.6 was very simple, very cozy, home to some; Source immediately I did not like - but even he was closer to 1.6. GO looks more like a reincarnation of some Kalouti in the setting of Counter Strike, but not the reincarnation of 1.6, which oldpage will cry tears of joy and childishly happy face to fill the REP, laying bombs. It rather smacks of a banal desire to cut money for the same game for the third time, as would be sad as that sounds Another thing I want to say - GO is very ambiguous in terms of its scall. I.e. developers, for example, wanted to add in a new game mods from the old games that were very popular. This well. But they added for some reason only the GunGame mode - it is here we must pay tribute, implemented well and about no less popular ZombieMod, DeathRun, JailBreak somehow forgot. It seems that the developers do not know how to make the game was close in spirit to the original, but it has pleased the fans of modern soulless postrelushka and add a little bit of everything in the blind hope that this trick will work. Now added, for example, GunGame. Here graton pulled. Well. The REP and iCloud too. But what pushed statistics and ranks these ing. Added new weapon. Why dog on earth, added, everything seems so normal it was. But no - added some idiotic tactical grenades-blende, some Molotov cocktails, which, BL**u, I've never let nobody uses zapili some popsource trailers on YouTube that all so spot on and crap - Oh, what a new counter-Strick soap-cool, go-ka przekazu and get the cannon in TF2. But the whole point of the game is that not myltse, and not even in puschka! Here such pies. Well, something like that. I think of my words and colour illustrations can in principle be what is no idea of Global Offensive. Actually, to make it even with the beta, then I even review I wanted to write, but somehow it never happened. In General, after the beta, not much has changed. Popisil nasty bugs, added new pictures to the main menu (Oh yeah), all other nonsense - but the game itself remains the same. And even then, at the stage of beta, you can understand what is still feil. Because Valve have tried to keep up with two rabbits and make a game that would love and ardent fans of the series, and fans of the new-fangled postrelushka. And chip, fellas, that, for example, those lovers of the postrelushka will not find in the "new" game is none favorite Blokov or hurricane some gameplay or killstreaks, equipment, single campaign in General, starburst solid, and only. And the old farts in the new game will not find the spirit of the old school, old models of weapons, any hints, rasprygat and other joys of life. And it is not clear to me, boys, for whom this game is made. And no, I'm not saying this game is bad, not at all, it is able to inspire, and not even for one night, and maybe even someone to buy the box with the game, which will be even smell good - but from the Studio named Valve everybody has come to expect more. Summing up short, so to say, the verdict, CS:GO is a game for a generation who does not know what B-5-1 and dablack. The only question is, lol, do I need itself GO to this generation.
The One That Lurks;-;Game is really fun and has a very good competive match
.endy/// #BillyMilligan;-;If you want play this game you need to learn Russian, if not, you will never know what the  is your team doing. Have fun! :D

Oliva Twist;-;To not own this game is like being a chick without bewbs, you're not complete. And to not own skins in the game is like being a bird without pride-feathers, you're not pretty. Thank me later for learning you life lessons. Now go learn some russian!
Nathan That Asian;-;This is a 20/10. Its so good :3
-Slix-;-;One of the best games i have ever played. There are some anoyying bits here and there, like how you get cooldowns after every 2 games you win if you are unranked or if your computer shuts down and you dont get back in the 3 very very very short minutes then you get a cooldown and if that happens over and over again you can get a 7 day ban. Well other than that it is a fantastic game. I have been playing it for 3 weeks and have had so much fun. Competetive is the best its not like your playing call of duty and you can just play for fun. Most of the time its serious because you are trying to not derank and you are trying to rankup. Overall 5/5
Froo;-;While getting into this game can be kinda hard since it's not your average noskill shooter. The moment you get the basics this game become extreme fun. You rely in your teammates more than you would think and communication is key. I would buy this game if you like teamwork and you like games that require skill to play. Or you can just buy a p90, rush, and enjoy silver rank.

majikerN;-;This game is just amazing. The musics, the gameplay, the community, etc... You are matched up with people of the same skill in order to get fair fights. The graphics are good and you don't need an outstanding PC to run it! Plus, it is rather cheap!
psixyio;-;CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play, where you play 10 games that you cannot leave (unless you want to tarnish your reputation), after which you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair no matter what skill level you are. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.

Lilith;-;I'm gonna redo the review since mine was outdated. GO is Counter-Strike, and it's just as punishing as the other ones, but compared to Source you have better hitboxes and recoil system. What makes it the most played CS today is that for one it's the newest one, but more importantly Valve actually updates it, and built it from ground up from pro and community feedback. Gameplay-wise you'll have the same experience with enhanced visuals if you're a seasoned CS:GO player, but if you're new, you're probably going to get dominated if you simply jump into Competitive games. New players should watch Pro plays to get an understanding of game sense and get comfortable with a role, and for your own sake, don't solo-queue or you'll grow a hatred on everything that remotely sounds Russian. The roles are Entry and Second Rifler, Lurker, and AWPer. Even though many say AWPing is for noobs, don't get discouraged. If you feel yourself comfortable with the scoped 1shot rifle, go for the role regardless. As for matchmaking community, it goes as is. Silver will be the nicest teammates you can have, and might even gift you skins, but their kindness doesn't make up for skill if you seek the Competetive edge. Nova will be okay-ish, but there's some toxicity. Master Guardian to DMG will be toxics who flame you if you don't execute a play their way, even if it's a win. Eagles and upwards take this game too seriously, pursue a career in eSports, or soon will have a VAC badge on their account. Now that I've aforementioned skins, Arms Deal introduced them. At first it was recieved negative fire from the community, and even called TF2fication. Nowadays you'll find everyone being in posession of skins. There's even gambling sites for digital items from this game and keys have become a digital currency, making the TF2 point somewhat true in terms of economy. You'll want to consider whether or not to jump into this game, as it'll take a lot of time to be "decent", since the competitive part has a lot to learn. If you're more of a casual player, there's also game modes that cover that, and the legacy Community Servers which are put into the background, but luckily still existent and very active. Competetive or not, it's a worthwhile shooter for it's price which can even pay itself if you have sufficient semantics skill or are plain lucky, and if you look long enough you might find the nicer part of this community. But also pay attention to your expenses, should you get into unboxings, as special offers and music kits, are also cosmetic items. In a nutshell: You don't need them because they're cosmetic, but you get them anyway for bragging rights or to be part of the cool kids. Now jump in, and don't forget the Defuse Kit. [If you happen to be Russian, ignore the last sentence.]
Zemestrice;-;After playing this game I'v acquired some weapon skill that will help me to survive when Russia invades our country. Be afraid Putin, because I'm ready for you and your army !
OG Overclocker;-;This is an amazing game. I'm the best Shotgun-Jump-Sniper around, and I just love it when the enemy team, and my own team as well, complain of my MGLness.
Stkynukkehuora;-;I really want to learn to play this game, I really do. But does my teacher have to  me in the ?
SpankMyDoodle;-;Really good game, im just not good at it
Konran;-;The definitive Competitive online FPS, It blow's away the competion with good map design, and the overall gameplay. This game is all about getting every slight advantage you can, and using it against your oppenent. This game is not like Battlefeild, or CoD this game is very much like chess, where your placement and positioning can affect the outcome of a game. This all adds up to make CS:GO one of the most addicting game's I've ever played. I'd reccomend playing with friends instead of solo queing, because you are very likely to lose if you solo que. With that said, Good Luck HAVE FUN!

Because the maps look really good, modelki weapons and players are also good (that is, in fact, they just made qualitatively and of themselves are good, but look if they do well in this game is another question) - in short, graton I liked, despite the fact that generally Counter Strike is not a game where important grafon. At least, there is no such flatulence, excessive brightness, as in Source - graphon GO just a nice, where you have the gloomy, where it is bright. In General, good graton, normal, pleases the eye and the stars from the sky is not enough. And the map is very good. That is, as. Most of the maps in GO are copies of classic maps from 1.6. However, in contrast to the same Source environment and the design altered almost completely - if the Source just got my texture, added normal Sormovsky features like lying all over the map garbage, there is virtually completely redesigned the concept and idea cards, leaving almost intact the original structure of the map. For example, de_dust2. In 1.6 and Source is a common Eastern city with pointed domes and intricate paintings a La cartoons about Aladdin. In GO, this map looks like a very levels of some CoD 4, because now this is not the tale of Aladdin, but rather dilapidated streets of, say, Syria. In this respect GO a head taller than their predecessors, meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression.

In this respect GO a head taller than their predecessors, meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression. All salt that GO missing... Like to call it, nanowaste. 1.6 was very simple, very cozy, home to some; Source immediately I did not like - but even he was closer to 1.6. GO looks more like a reincarnation of some Kalouti in the setting of Counter Strike, but not the reincarnation of 1.6, which oldpage will cry tears of joy and childishly happy face to fill the REP, laying bombs. It rather smacks of a banal desire to cut money for the same game for the third time, as would be sad as that sounds Another thing I want to say - GO is very ambiguous in terms of its scall. I.e. developers, for example, wanted to add in a new game mods from the old games that were very popular. This well. But they added for some reason only the GunGame mode - it is here we must pay tribute, implemented well and about no less popular ZombieMod, DeathRun, JailBreak somehow forgot. It seems that the developers do not know how to make the game was close in spirit to the original, but it has pleased the fans of modern soulless postrelushka and add a little bit of everything in the blind hope that this trick will work. Now added, for example, GunGame. Here graton pulled. Well. The REP and iCloud too. But what pushed statistics and ranks these ing. Added new weapon. Why dog on earth, added, everything seems so normal it was. But no - added some idiotic tactical grenades-blende, some Molotov cocktails, which, BL**u, I've never let nobody uses zapili some popsource trailers on YouTube that all so spot on and crap - Oh, what a new counter-Strick soap-cool, go-ka przekazu and get the cannon in TF2. But the whole point of the game is that not myltse, and not even in puschka! Here such pies. Well, something like that. I think of my words and colour illustrations can in principle be what is no idea of Global Offensive. Actually, to make it even with the beta, then I even review I wanted to write, but somehow it never happened. In General, after the beta, not much has changed. Popisil nasty bugs, added new pictures to the main menu (Oh yeah), all other nonsense - but the game itself remains the same. And even then, at the stage of beta, you can understand what is still feil. Because Valve have tried to keep up with two rabbits and make a game that would love and ardent fans of the series, and fans of the new-fangled postrelushka. And chip, fellas, that, for example, those lovers of the postrelushka will not find in the "new" game is none favorite Blokov or hurricane some gameplay or killstreaks, equipment, single campaign in General, starburst solid, and only. And the old farts in the new game will not find the spirit of the old school, old models of weapons, any hints, rasprygat and other joys of life. And it is not clear to me, boys, for whom this game is made. And no, I'm not saying this game is bad, not at all, it is able to inspire, and not even for one night, and maybe even someone to buy the box with the game, which will be even smell good - but from the Studio named Valve everybody has come to expect more. Summing up short, so to say, the verdict, CS:GO is a game for a generation who does not know what B-5-1 and dablack. The only question is, lol, do I need itself GO to this generation.
The One That Lurks;-;Game is really fun and has a very good competive match
ConeSeer;-;This games in sick ay
Snow;-;best shooter in which I played all advise
FunG;-;Great game, requires teamplay and good tactics :)
ChipFlexes -S- ICA;-;CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) is an (Online) First Person Shooter game. The game is very simular to the other Counter-Strike games out there, but this one is special, it has new maps, new types of playstyle, a great community & ofcourse skins. It's basically the type of game that you could play for hours and still never get bored of it (thanks to a growing community, new maps etc.) This game isn't a hardcore ''MLG-Pro 720 NoScope'' Simulator like Call of Duty (No offense to the CoD community) This is basically an awesome game. Now to the part why you should buy it.. As I wrote before, you could play for hours and still enjoy it. This game is not too expensive yet not too cheap. It could get expensive, if you get into buying skins and such, but that's just your choice. GAMEPLAY: Gun sounds are good you could recognize every gun, and pretty realistic. (Atleast in my opinion) Sound quality is good, especially if you have good quality headphones. (Footsteps etc. is good to listen to for improved gameplay) Aiming and such is very diffrent to other games but is easy to master if you change your crosshair and your sensitivity to what you like and feel comfortable with. ________________________________________________________ Overall a very good game. Worth the money. 9.8/10 - ChipFlexes

Nick 'supreeh';-;Revan was only 22 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His dad hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his dad is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life...

reflexe;-;+balanced game +high skill ceiling +skill and tactic based game +can run on a potato +cheap -bots suck and can ruin a match (when a player on your team leaves) -toxic community around the silver range -competitive cooldown i love cs. played 1.6, source, and now csgo. would definitely reccomend this game to people looking for a game requiring teamwork and skill. can run on a crappy PC, and it's worth the $15. 8/10 tl;dr - buy.

Endreo;-;CS:GO is a really good game, but it has one of the worst communities in the history of games. It's a really good game to play competitive matchmaking with your friends, but if you play alone, you'll quickly find out that you would much rather not be playing. A competitive match can last up to 90 minutes and if you abondon the game, kill 3 teammates or deal a lot of damage to them, abuse the kick system, AFKing or cheating, you will get punished in bans. The first time you break one of the rules above you get a 30 minute ban. If you break the rules after that, you get a 2 hour ban, then 24 hours, and finally, a 7 day ban. Now think of it like this. You decide to join a competitive match while playing alone. You get matched with some really nasty people, and you have to sit there, and deal with them for the next 90 minutes, and if you leave the match, you get punished for it... 10/10 would play with friends, 0/10 would never play alone (soloqueue)
mooppy yuu;-;Very fun but there is a hacker promblem which kills the competetive aspect

Maestrul AWP;-;A game with a sweet sense of justice.... After playing about 500 hours of CS:GO, you learn the difference between evil and good... From my point of view, a fantastic game, with a marvelous multicultural fever, starting with kind hearted russians, nad ending to incredible russian hack operators... Just 10 ours of gameplay spent, and you'll start to learn new ways to confess your thoughts (gained in this short period of time) and start to use magnificent words as cika, suka bleah, putin, balalaika, kurwaaaa, etc. totally recommend this game, especially for the young community, composed of kids between 10 and 14 years old, sharing their ethic raw input...
Dude;-;Fact: Have played CS series since the first, cannot recommend this game. Very broken - you can do anywhere from 11 to 200 damage when shooting someone with a shotgun no matter how well you aim and how close you are, you will see blood pour out of your enemies to have the game tell you you did no damage, and you will shoot someone in the head with an assault rifle and do 2 damage when they do 211 with the same rifle (despite them having no armour or helmet and you do). Opinion: The recoil pattern feature in this game is also silly, as you literally have to aim downwards and draw a T shape while shooting to keep your shots on target (Yes, the patterns are essentially fixed patterns) with the crosshair rather than do your best to keep it focussed on them. Guns which are the same calibre and similar barrel lengths (sometimes have longer barrels by far) will do alot less damage and penetrate armour worse than more expensive ones. Doesn't make any sense. This game is very broken and I suggest you just play CSS instead, as it is alot more accurate and features 100 tick servers (over competitive 64 tick, COMPETITIVE). CSS is also more expensive by 5 bucks because maybe valve knows that csgo is a complete mess. TL;DR: CSGO isn't a CS about skill, it is a CS about rolling the dice everytime you shoot someone. If you don't believe me then youtube a video of CSGO hit detection, I assure you you'll be amazed at how bad it is. EDIT: Turns out the game was originally going to be made for consoles but then Valve decided to develop it more for PC instead - Game is a console port too.
Fissan;-;i fink bad game ING MANY RUSSIANS All Russians are silver Get over silver rank and you wont derank anymore because of russians Russians are brain damage.. If u get full Russian team, quit game, only if they all hack you will win otherwise its a time waste!
DaRealLeno;-;Met about 1000 russians none of them were stalkers
DaNGeRoUS;-;It used to be my favorite game! But now you can just try try and try very hard. But you will keep loosing and more and more people are using hacks. VAC does not detect them as they are sophisticated programs. Whats the point. Unless this is addressed along with a huge list of other bugs.. its just you trying your best to no avail. Go ahead and keep tyring but hackers are wining. This applies to the Match Making and competetive play more than it does to casual. But you have hackers in casual as well. So sadly this negative review.. changed from a previous positive one. :(
2JZ;-;Cheater here, cheater there, cheater everywhere.
jgbenni;-;"This is a wondeful game where you can interact with new and fun people from all around the world" said no one ever ! all you do is find a match with russian hackers and pakistani smurfs and lose lose lose and lose and even more lose ! BUT wait then you find a game... your 14-0 up and BOOOM out of knowhere the russian hacker toggles and you lose the game !
| **DeCoY**;-;You pay for a game, that you then pay for missions to achieve achievments, that tells you you are not allowed to play for upto 3 Days because you have played to much, or it wont let you into competative mode if you win a game for the first 10 wins?? NOT HAPPY Valve... just tell people the game is $XX.XX amount of dollars and get on with the GAME!.. KIDS are Lying to and STEALING their parants money to pay for stupid asthetics content.. You are culturing a new generations of devious criminals, VALVE should hanfg its head in shame! FYI, I have been playing CS for some 15 years not 5, like your system advertises..
RhysSs;-;I personally love this game yet the CSGO community is terrible join a match 1 bad play get yelled at do good carry still considerd bad by your team do fantastic people think your a smurf and  and complain talk about how silvers are terrible get kicked and yelled at so if you want to get yelled at and want to get kicked repeatidly until you get a 7 day ban well this is your game!!
Raven;-;No matter what I put here people are going to vote it down but for those that care, been playing the game for about a year and a half. The game only gets updated for new skins and knives. If it ever gets updated for anything it's because it's game breaking or a major complaint and even then it takes forever. IE the CZ75, a pistol, was more powerful than the rifles for awhile and it took them over half a year to actually fix it and even then they didn't test it and had to update it again to properly fix it. The game was updated more to actually improve the game when it peaked at 20k playing per day.
Bitch NIiga;-;30 min cooldown - got kicked too much for playing like  2 hour cooldown - got kicked for doing  1 day cooldown - Internet shutdown in my neighbhorhood 7 day cooldown - played like /had to walk dog. Volvo why u do this? Too much cooldown
Renegade;-;crawling simulator 2015 this game is fun until someone shoots you and you cant move
DatGameDev;-;Its fun but as soon as something happens like your computer overheats and you have to turn it off or your iternet connection decides it doesn't care anymore valve decides oh look that player has left the game for 3 minute i know lets give a ban. it starts out ok with a 30 minute then a day(I think) but then its a seven day ban and if you keep disconnecting from games you will constantly get a ban like me.
rdM.Pharmacist |Dre|;-;meh, game so lacking in depth, that the only gameplay in it revolves around exagerated recoil. If you are prepared to spend hours shooting each gun at a wall to learn the spray patterns which arent even random, then this game is for you. This is one of those games that you actually have to study seemingly insignificant factors in order to enjoy. In other words, you have to work hard to find the fun that there is to be had. It's one of those games that you only enjoy in hindsight if you have won, but you likely will not enjoy the bore of each repetitive round. The strategy revolves around being blinded, either by a flash bang, or smoke. So, even if you happen to spend the thousands of hours it takes to be consistent with the various weapons, there is the issue that this is a team game that is more intensive than dota or LOL. If you are prepared to deal with casual players in matchmaking claiming that "it's just a game, its ok to lose every time." then this game is for you. Other players will likely ruin your competitive experience, or you will ruin theirs. Then there is the issue of registry. There are many hackers, many smurfs, and many exploiters in this quite popular bore of a game. Beyond that, there are players that exploit their exorbenant ping to get an advantage over you when possible. If you are prepared to be a loser, because of 64 tick servers, ddossers, laggers, smurfs, hackers, and terrible teammates, then this game is for you. Then, there is the fact that this is a winners game. Remember when you played winners version of basketball, where if you make the shot you go again. This game is kind of like that. Winners get paid, losers dont. So when you lose, you lose hard. So hard that you cannot afford weapons the next round, and must thus, lose again. These are called "eco rounds" when you are saving your economy for the next round, which is a gamble as well; because if you lose that round, you will have to eco again. You can understand the stress involved with this game at a competitive level. It makes competitive starcraft 2 almost seem trivial, yet its game mechanics and depth of gameplay is utterly lacking and uninteresting. The reward for having invested 90 minutes of aging stress into a video game where 75% of the time your upset, is that you may win and experience temporary joy until the next game that you lose. This cycle continues, and you always chase the high of a game won. No wonder so many players play this game. Its sort of like growing weed, 9 months of growing, 2 months of curing, and you finally get to smoke it, only in this game 50-70% of the time, your house gets raided by the cops and you have no weed to smoke after your extreme time investment; leaving you extremely upset. In short, this game revolves around blindng players, controlling recoil like a 3 year old girl (you literally cannot hit what your crosshair is aiming at, kind of misleading) and you certainly cannot hit what is directly in front of you, if you hold the trigger down. That being said, if your aim is terrible, and you arent aimed at your target, and you still spray, you will likely get headshots and random kills, because the bullets dont go where you aim anyways. This is why young children like to play this game. There is a thrill to be had when experiencing so much luck. So if you plan on spending 10,000 hours to become an average player at this game with an average rank and win loss ratio, be my guest. You cannot become great at this game, without a great team, and the thousands of hours fiddling with recoil with various guns, at various distances, on various maps, against various players, who use various techniques. That being said, with the time investment that it takes to actually enjoy this game and have fun, you could likely have gotten laid by numerous women. Don't be a virgin for life, trying to learn how to have fun, at a silly game. TLDR look at my hours, I got to DMG, thats when i realized, this game takes way too much trivial skill to be worth my time. I'll be playing games like insurgency, starcraft 2, gta V, and killing floor 2. Out of the 600 hours I put into this game, I likely enjoyed 10 or so. I don't see what all the buzz is about.

Astrydax;-;well, i had 2 kids in my game trolling a sure win bc i picked up an awp. So the rest of the game they did nothing but try to stand in front of teammates so that they would accidently team kill, my brother left the game and got a 1 week ban, i stayed and played, accidently killed the kid that kept jumping in front of me, got a 2 week ban. my roommate was in the game with us and not wanting a ban, just sat at spawn... and he got afk auto kicked and has a 2 day ban. All 3 of us got bans while the 2 people that actually needed the ban got off scott free. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. TOXIC community ZERO EFFORT from the devs to fix the JUSTICE SYSTEM in place that BANS INNOCENT PLAYERS trying to play the game the proper way while PROTECTING GRIEFERS.
Leorganisation;-;I can't get why so much people out there like CS,but I can say only 1 thing: This game is dumb as FIICK! ...But wait,I've got 100+ hrs playin' it o.O
192837;-;Good game to bad its filled with cheaters
Squidge;-;The community is absolutely ing , flooded with stuck up little ing rat twelvie . the game is plagued by smurfs to the point were competitive is broken and unbalanced as , this is further back up by their massive ing in your face  talking mother ing egos. This game is ing terrible, in terms of balancing its ing "competitive" game mode. NOW ONTO CASUAL, no s given here from the developers as they allow 16 aside on maps made for no more than 5 a side, this turns the game into a ing cluster  and ruins the experience. FIX SMURFING.
(=CG=) Inject;-;CSGO is easily the worst Counter Strike game in the franchise, which is generally what happens when you toss it off to a new team that has never worked on the game before. Good bye turtle rock studio, hello crap one. With some of the worst players in any game I've ever played CSGO has the absolute worst toxic community players I have ever witnessed. This includes games such as DOTA, LOL, and any other toxic MOBAs. Something I never thought I could say. Playing Competitive is almost unbearable for this reason alone, sadly, however there any many other reasons why this game is unplayable and serves no purpose in a sane individuals library of games. Another great reason is from the latest update which results in anyone whom has over 50 ping wanting to rip out their own hair as the hit reg will be so abysmal that there wont even be a reason to play or to even continue living at that point. This leaves high ping players deep in the dark. Not everyone can have great ping especially when you are essentially forced to play on valve only servers which sometimes are super far from your location. Not to mention the hit reg is just bad as it is to begin with, did I mention the recoil system is invisible? Your gun does not shoot up into the air bullets just magically come out in random directions, to the point where if you need to spray you have to aim at the floor to shoot in the sky. At this point I'm sure the devs know this game is awful, lets not forget the fact that every comp match has at least 3 smerf's and probably a hacker as well. The devs don't care though. This game is a money pot which it's highly addictive economy with tf2 like skin system makes all the kiddies explode. Woo mom's wallet has never been so empty, 12 year old power! Yeah ok, have fun kids. Everyone goes mad bat  on this game. I'm sure it will continue to do well for many years to come, nothing will change the pro scene will keep going and players will keep being awful. Do your self a favour and don't join the aids network. Good luck and may god have mercy on your soul if you buy this game. 6/10
[C]Deadzior;-;I totally not recommend this game and this are my thoughts - 60% of community is using esp's/aimbots that are free and easly found - 15% of community is using Premium ones for 15-20 bucks that are undetectable so they dont even give a  to VAC - I played 7 matches in a row and in those matches i meet cheaters, one match i got a whole team at my side using ESP they didnt even gave a single  for reports or overwatch and i asked them why. They told me that the game costs 5 euro. - Counter strike GO lost its fun or competetive look by this total crap and mass of cheaters or russians.I got Master Guardian 2 ofc i know that this rank is not the biggest but the experience is the same. - Thank you Valve for you totally useless passive VAC anticheat system that does crap to those people for ruining so many games. - I will never play Counter strike GO again And to all my friends and people who are playing that crap game Dont buy it and dont play it it's not worth your time and nerves. - I only recommend this game for cheaters since they can cheat other cheaters for fun but for a legit player these days it's . This game changed for worse a lot worse even proplayers in leagues are cheating now...
Ben Dover  csg0.com;-;This game was cool before I went to competitive. I always have some russians who insult me or some trollers who dont care about rank. I have never seen this bad community in my whole life.
IncRaz;-;CSGO has the full potential to be one of the greatest games in the past decade, but due to smurf- ranking system, low price = hacker overload, and teammates who refuse to communicate either because of language barrier or just to troll, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. Counter strike has always been the king of computer games. Unfortunately the king has been slowly beheaded by smurfs. 1 out of 5 competitive ranked matches you play will be about teams of equal skill trying to win, in which case losing is a process of learning and imporving. 4 out of 5 times you're stuck with a wallhacker on the other team, a leaver in your own team and two russians shouting gibberish and not-so-subtle critisism for a full match of 30-90 minutes. Also the smurf in your team is cancer to the community, wondering why everyone else sucks at the lower ranks. If Valve doesn't start seriously investing their efforts to the nightmare that is current matchmaking and reporting system, they might soon be loosing many if not all of the legit players. Almighty Gaben, help us win this war on terror.ism.
Shouri;-;This game is fun to play and dont get me wrong when i write this but the game in its current condition is broken. the matchmaking could not be worse and even if the matchmaking is ''right'' you get a smurf from Legendairy eagle in the enemy team. and in the lower ranks you get people who dont know hot to use the microphone or they have not a microphone in possesion. buying this game is a gamble for rather you will enjoy this game or enjoy it even more when un-installing.
It's a secret;-;To many ing Trolls that kick you when your in competitive for no reason and then you get a 7day cooldown from playing competitive. GG Valve your  for making that. Plis Go commit Seppuku.
TurtleAlien( );-;cant even play because of the last update... fix ur
StayLLeR  Satans;-;Man, if i had to say something about this game, is just, FIX THAT DAM , the ing game is perfect, i play Counter Strike since i was 10 i guess. And man, this game is very good, but it`s administration SUCKS, there is ing HACKS every 3 matches you play, and you are going to get  like me, AND I ING REFUSE TO BE A  AND PLAY USING THAT  HACKS. If Valve gave a little  to this, they would have fixed that, and REMOVE ALL PLAYERS that use, or have used that .
Nightmare;-;I'm so addicted to this game but now i start hating it so much , since cs1.6 vlave coudn't stop cheats and hacks on this game , and now in csgo mmr most of players are using WH but they don't get bans . I'm really so upset now and i don't recommend this game unless you playing it in lan enviroment .
Mikami Zakim;-;Yeah you can complain about cheaters, but i still say i like it more than Cheats of duty. In addition i also like getting punched in the stomach more then being  on. Also Cheats of duty is still , and will continue to  on their consumers like the  it is. I made my point clear..
Khxlil;-;This game gave me cancer. And the ability to speak fluent russian.

AOT_Ghoul;-;This game is good. I have learned over 1,000 Russian words more than I would ever learn in school. This game teaches you that buying $200+ knives is cool. It teaches you that team work and calling someone a "ing " for missing a shot. It teaches you that it is okay to invest thousand's of dollars into a game worth $15. Overall, this game teaches you many things. 10/10 would let my future children play.

TheMoonlightShadowWolf;-;* 10/10 * I'm addicted. This game is so much fun. It's great to play with your friends, easy to learn, and has multiple features that keep you coming back. There are five differnt game types, so there is always something you can play. Even if the game types get old, there is custom, where you can play user made maps, with endless different types of things to do. Something really cool about it is that there are two versions of the main game, competitive and casual. In casual you can practice and it just for fun, with nothing ever being saved. In competitive, wins and losses affect your points, the higher points you have the higher rank you get. People in competitive hope to one day make it to Global Elite, the highest rank possible which very few players ever make it into. Another interesting thing is skins, and using the market. I can't really explain that, so you will just have to play and see. I don't often give a perfect score, but 10/10.
[FP] Tung;-;Great game, community not as much.
pel;-;Skins. Angry humans. Funny humans. Insane things (even sometimes called "people" by their friends) Good for losing hope in humanity, then regaining it for a max of 2 random games, after about 5-9 games of starting to lose every hope you had, ever of humanity being good. (If you are planning to join the marines) This is realy good to semi-train your ears for unprovoked yelling. And ofc this is a fun game, even better if you are playing with friends... awsum sauce.
stayFrosty;-;Game systems and the graphics are great but a little bit silly bots. Overall, I love this game. :)
RockyRaccoon;-;russian insulting simulator 2015.
Zarrex;-;Okay, time for a real review. This is the first Counter-Strike game I actually got into, and I never realized what I'd been missing all these years. The mechanics of this game make it unlike any other franchise avalible today. But with a game this big, that just means more people and more problems. I'm am currently Distinguished Master Guardian at the time of writing this review, and I can firmly say that each game I play in matchmaking is either against at least one smurf (someone of a high rank on a new account playing against lower ranked players) or a hacker. Sure, there are external matchmaking services like ESEA, CEVO, or FaceIT, but the in-game matchmaking should still be playable. That being said, if you don't already own this game, I would highly suggest getting it, but if you find that you like it a lot, and want to get better, be prepared to play a lot. This is not a game you can just pick up and be amazing at like Call of Duty or any other arcade shooter. You actually have to invest time into this game if you want to play competive matches and get better at the game. For one thing, you shoot while you are moving, and you also need to learn how to control the spray pattern of your weapons, because bullets DO NOT stay on your crosshair. Closing words, this is a fantastic game, with it's flaws of course. Very solid gameplay mechanics that helped shape PC FPSs today, but also ran by a company which is known for not being transparent with their customers. If you really want to get into this game and learn what it's all about, find some friends and start playing, because soon you won't be able to go 3 days without playing a match. glhf.
~Doktor Panic;-;Amazing game!! Actually requires a lot of skill, patience, and good aiming!! I use to run around and just click my mouse a billion times, but this game has taught me the importance of foot step sounds, clicking rapidly depending on distance of the enemy, and pulling down on the guns recoil to maintain the spray in one area!!
Kuro(AFK);-;I think it's really a nice game for all FPS player XD and it really suit me.
TURBODIESEL;-;play this with your friends and play it hard and you will have the time of your life. don't forget to scream "ALLAHU AKBAR" and empty your clip at the end of every winning round.
Sphere Box;-;Hard game for beginners but eventually it's fun. This is the first FPS game I've played that demands careful shots thanks to recoil than bullet spamming enemies once they're in your crosshair. The bullet penetration adds the real-world flavour and there's even a warmup round for shooting just about anywhere even that filthy hostage if you're on terrorist side. 10/10 Would recommend for challenge-seeking/competitive gamers mostly but not so for the easy-going casual FPS gamers who prefer continuous bullet spam.
Handi;-;9.5/10 it's OK
Lt.Peter;-;10/10 Everyone Loves Chickens Everyone Loves AWP Everyone Loves De_Dust 2
.0day;-;This is a super awesome and fun game that reminds me of CoD: Modern Warfare(better known as Cod4). Anyone who has been playing FPSs for years will understand what I am saying, and generally everyone agrees that CoD4 was one of the best franchise FPS games ever developed. While I don't think CS:GO is on the CoD4 level, it certainly does have that feel to it, and that's what draws me towards this game. The feeling I get from this game is one of simplicity and functionality; something too many game corporations out there continue to skip right past. All they want to do is make these crazy FPS games with all these unnecessary gadgets and "killstreaks" and tons of other crap, when in reality, all the game community wants is a simple, stable, fun, and hardcore matchmaking powerhouse. For me, CS:GO hits all of the high points, while only hitting maybe one or two of the low points. Get this game.
HACKED BY VYR0N;-;That moment when i get kicked by russians after carrying them so hard 11/10 - would chase chickens again
Wadderz1337;-;Well i got in at a discount and I don't know about you but I lost all my friends and family and any contact to the world the day I bought this game. So yeah..... Buy it
SliverStruggle;-;How to counterstrike. Launch game. Loose 200 games before you win 10. Get ranked sliver 1. FInd better strats in youtubes. Rank up to sliver 2. Never use those strats again. Get your friends to play.  around with ur friends. First 16-0 loss. U sad. U cri. Find out about skins. Buy case and key. Want knife Dont get knife Blame Gaben. Love Gaben. Repeat Gaben is love Gaben is life.
Yash1m;-;this is one of the best games so far !!!
Grimeth;-;Community of hackers who moan over colorfull weapon skins 9.9/10 It's ok
Unique Eltigre;-;My girlfriend decided to make me choose between her or the game. I am now Supreme.
Hammarn;-;A fantastic game with a good competetive scene!
[BA] Baron von Haxor;-;Possibly the most enraging game ever. I do like this game and I've liked it a lot since they added skins and stattraks. If you want it, you should buy it!!!. BetterthanCoD/10
Alias;-;This game is amazing. It is a remake of an old classic (which is still strong on top 10 most played Steam game after 15 years running!), Counter-Strike. It's a game that is simply defined as a barebones, tense shooter. It's very simple. You either defend an objective, be that a hostage or more commonly a bomb/bombsite, from the either side, or attack said objective. It's a game where the tides forever shift, in one instant your team may have bomb control (an insane advantage for CT side), in another it's only you left against a lone terrorist and the bomb is ticking down slowly. Though it may not be appealing for everyone, if you like shooters and don't want to churn out $60+ each year for trash heaps of lame so-called "twitch-shooters," look no further. Oh, also there are weapon skins. But no one buys a game just to show off expensive knife skins... Right..? RIGHT??! - RATING: knife/10 would blame 64 tick again
Where;-;Learned Fluent Russian and Spanish after 2 matches of Competitive.
SimplyViper;-;Awesome FPS game and it not like COD were you just use a gun and shoot it, but in CS:GO you need to control it. If you love FPS games you should get this.
VAC;-;Great fun. Super addicting :D

MorgisS Dead Girls Don't Say No;-;Good game, a lot of russians, but fun still. Great game if you want to learn russian in a week.
xXxDriLLeRxXx;-;Easiest way to learn slavic languages (especially russian). Also you can buy & sell crap for money. 5/5 Cuban cigars. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
Greps;-;Russians everywhere. 10/10

rZa Triickster #180;-;Can be fun
Shintaku;-;One simple thing: Good old CS experience, but now in a better-looking way. And also: Useless Skins! 10/10 would buy again
LaGGer;-;In my opinon the best FPS ever created. The match making is great for competitve play or just playing some casual games with friends. It also features revamped graphics and interface from Counter Strike Source. It also has some nice new gamemodes like an offical Deathmatch and Gungame + a new gamemode called demolition, which is kind of like gungame and a normal bomb plant gamemode combined. I enjoy this the most out of the CS series. It even offers some new weapons that are fun to use like Mollys, a Sawed off Shotgun, my personal favorite the Tec 9, and even a Tazer!
Stacks;-;Your "skill" is based on the market value of your inventory. Skins can be worth 25 times that of the game itself. You get one hit by most guns if people can use them well. Most people can use said guns well. Larger concentration of 12 year old australians than TF2. Little s beg for skins. Seriously  australian kids. 11/10 would buy again brilliant game EDIT: 1000 hours on and I've wasted hundreds of dollars on this game. I'm ing LE, said I'd stop at nova christ almighty. Come to realise that there are shitcunts galore and I am one of them. I literally did buy again. I have purchased the same ing game purely to  on new players and feel superior.  this game 12/10
Hell Hath No Fury Like Me;-;Great game, but whatever you do DO NOT buy keys or any of that other stuff in game. The key-chest system is a total rip off and the iest RNG of any game I've ever played EVER.
Nam #r.i.p Iwata;-;The community of this game is pretty... OFFENSIVE AHAHAHAHAHA! I'm sorry i'll leave :( 10/10 from ign I like league of legends mroe than dota2  at me nerds

9/11 Is My Favorite Holiday!;-;I didn't know what to write about in my review, so here's a recipe for pancakes instead: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon white sugar 1 1/4 cups milk 1 egg 3 tablespoons butter, melted 1. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth. 2. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
Wildfire;-;Just Buy It!!
lukas*csgo-lottery.com;-;The best competitive game I've played so far. It is a lot of fun, especially when you're playing with your friends in competitive mode. I can totally recommend this game.
You Are An Waifu;-;A very fun game to play. This game is very competetive and at times you will have your team shouting at you because you didn't do something correctly. There is no doubt in my mind that this games community is extremely toxic. Putting this aside it can be very fun game to play once you get that first initial learning curve down. One thing that everyone says about this game is that its easy to learn but hard to master. :) -Jimmy
Jet Fuel Can't Melt Steel Beams;-;I like this game, im defenitly not a smurf. 9/11

Cpt. Soonfald;-;AWP Simulator 2012. I like it. Virtual knives that cost more than real knives, stickers that cost as much as they do in the real world, and weapon skins worth 10 cents and let everyone know you are good. This game has everything you never knew you wanted out of a game.
Sync;-;This game is absolutely sickening, proving to be a well rounded fps that really gets the headshots pumping. Really enjoy clicking on heads. gj
Doctor;-;Never played this thing. My 1st hour of playing was discovering how to buy grenades, now I can kill people with boom. Of course I always miss....

Greywalker;-;shoot someone. then shoot them again. repeat
El Mesas de la Muerte;-;The objective of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is to find cases after matches, then sell those cases on the Steam marketplace so you can earn money to buy a better game.
AlpacaPuddin;-;I'm a single father and Gaben banned me from competitive until Half Life 3 comes out. ( Which will never come out. ) If you like this post it will help me raise enough money for me to buy another CS:GO. Please help. God bless. P.S. - I got banned for taking hostages in CS:GO and sacrifing them to EA. It was a mistake. I'm sorry Gabe. Plesae forgive.
Kido;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is both a good and a terrible game. And if I say terrible I mean the deathmatch. The deathmatch is on the same level like his MW 3 counterpart which means it is unplayable. It allows to kill people from behind and the spawn protection is to long. The fact that CS: GO needs a spawn protection for a deathmatch mode shows how bad the game designe is. AND YES: I KNOW THAT DEATHMATCH IS THE MOST UNIMPORTANT GAME MODE BUT THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACTS. The rest in a short form: Casual: To many players per side. It would be more playable with 8v8 or 7v7 matches. Arms Race / Demolition: At all funny modes. If you have a 30 minute break at work and nothing to do, play it. Competitive: Try to play it just with friends. Playing with randoms can be really annoying.
Stoupe;-;bought it for pho s moaning
Arcadion;-;Best way to learn russian as fast as possible :)
Emppu;-;Game would be pefrect without smurfs,hackers and russians.
Peeps;-;its the greates Counter Strike Yet
Punzybobo;-;Sold nearly all of my skins to buy GTA V. Then I found out it wasn't even on sale. RIP.
Hellacious;-;This game is the best game i've ever played. I may have a slight skin addiction but that's not important. When i say slight I mean major. BEWARE OF THE SKINS. IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF YOU'RE GOOD OR BAD AT THE GAME, ALL THAT MATTERS IS HOW YOUR WEAPONS LOOK. So with that 10/10 would go broke again
ElevatedMeat;-;One of the best FPS games I have ever played. Get it.
nyaN^ * DontFlexPls;-;Reason I dislike the game: Team Problems... Me: "Alright lets setup smokes A and push it" Teammate lurking B: "Why didn't you guys push B with me" Money Problems... Me: "Can I get a drop" (1,000 Dollars) Teammate: "You can buy your self" (16k) Strats... Silver: 34Kills pushing mid with p90 every round. DMG: Plays the game smart and bottom frags. But idk I still play it.
Loop The Cynical Senpai;-;I didn't know one bit of Russian. Until I played this game. I r8 8/8 m8. Great game for learning Russian. Passed exam easily.

spray and pay;-;This game could ultimately compared to Dota 2. Whereever you go, what server you join, be it Norway or Australia, the only words you're going to hear differ between "" "Blyat" "" and other nonsense. Still a pretty fun game.
@Rolezki *ASUS;-;Awesome game and I like playing this game with another people. Only bad thing is unskilled players and Russian players :/

Vyktor -;-;Buy it, or i kick your mother! 10/10
GoldBot;-;After playing this game I learned how to speak perfect russian!
Bruffe;-;I think CS: GO is one of the best FPS games. You can play normal games and you can play competitive games. The competitive games are 5 vs 5 and by playing you get a rank. If you loose much your rank will decrease, and if you win much your rank will increase. You can buy weapons of the Steam Market for Steam Wallet money. You can watch streams of pros and tournaments.
ZombieSniper900;-;All my friends left my chats to play comp 10/10 would cry alone again
Jace;-;I waste my life shooting at people, missing and then getting shot at and killed. Then I cry for 8 hours and try again. Highly recommended.
Swaggleberry Hummus;-;Got into a casual match and got kicked for being AFK. I just joined the game.
#`GHo$T .. !;-;love this game :$ it's getting closer and closer to 1.6 while still retaining all of what I like about source.

Wobe;-;learnt Russian quicker than i ever could on Rosetta Stone. 10/10
spooderman;-;good game if you play comp and can find a team to play with. solo queue sucks. feed gaben by opening cases 10/10 would unbox knife again
DaKi_B;-;This game is truly a masterpiece; it provides hours of fun weather you are playing alone or with friends. It has a competitve stage for people who really just want to play to win and there are tons of community servers with different mods and gamemodes. The game also has skins, which change the appearence of you weapons in game. You can get these skins by random chance at the end of each game or open up boxes for a chance at different skins for a fee; these skins can then be sold on the steam market for real money or traded for other skins. While this game is amazing it also has it's cons; there is a notable amount of hackers in the game, even though valve is trying it's best to keep them out of the game they are still there. But that is the main con, of course the game has some glitches here and there but the hackers are really the main issue. Even with it's cons this game is really amazing. 9/10
Seven;-;Used my mothers credit card to buy a karambit knife. Was evicted, wasn't disappointed. 9/10 IGN approves.
Loki;-;One of my most played games recently. Although I didn't play the other games in the franchise, Global Offensive hooked me in its simple, yet complex gameplay. The gunplay is remarkably fun and veterans to the franchise will no doubt tell you of the strategy and competitive nature of the game. Semi-easy to learn, difficult to master, and tons of fun to play.

n1ex SAIYAJIN;-;Best game on steam By Gaben :D
TheUndeadNub;-;Do I recommend this game? Yes, in the most ironic way possible. Counter Strike is not your traditional First Person Shooter. But by golly, is it one of the best. What I love about this game is the fact that running around and spraying doesn't work AT ALL. Sorry Call of Duty. If you do that, you won't even get a single hit on your target, just a shot to the head and not a second thought. This game revolves around coordinated team work, and if you don't have that, you are NOT going to win a single match. Being good at shooting will only get you so far. This game is best played with a group of friends to form your own 5 man team because sitting on Skype or any other third party voice communication program with 5 people you know is a lot easier than holding a key to talk to people you don't know. But, the beauty of this game is that most of the time you have to learn to stratagize with people you have never talked to before, and that is really cool. Everyone wants to win, so everyone works together. Of course, there are always some people who team kill, don't work with the team, or just spout "OMG HAX" everytime they die. But don't let these few people scare you away from this game. It is the most fustrating, yet sastifying FPS I have ever played. Each day I get better at it, and each day I enjoy it more and more. Only about 50 hours in... and lots more to go to be a Global Elite. In summary; CS:GO requires practice, team work, and patience. But when you start getting the hang of it, by damn is it a great time. No matter how angry it can make you, it's a whole lot of fun.

Next minute you walk in a room and theres three lesbians finger banging their 's out. My mom seen me playing it and took away my computer for 2 months. Great game though.
Han Yolo;-;I HATE THIS GAME!!!

|SaW| M17CH M;-;This game is a very competitive and fast paced shooter that actually requires skill. Use of tactics, flashbangs, grenades and team work is very important in this game to succeed. There are hackers but usually not alot of them in the upper ranks MG1-GE. This game is an opportunity to play competitively with friends or other random people or to just mess about on deathmatch; either way, you'll have fun. :)
Jet;-;What can I say, really? It's Counter Strike. Play it, kill people, rage when they kill you, then blame it on the lag.
Nutty;-;--------------------------------------My CS:GO review--------------------- Oh CS:GO, how much you've changed. When I first Pre-ordered the game I thought "Man, another one in the series. I bet this is going to be the BEST! And so I was right. 1st day it came out: Played it. Won my first round myself. I still rememeber the feedback I got, "Game came out and someone has already skilled it." Oh the wonderful comments. But, something happened. I started leaving it. I don't know why!? Then, I wouldn't read what gamemode I was playing, started leaving, getting a cooldown, not caring. And now up to this point, I've reached a 7 day everytime. Then I started leaving the game again. 2 days, 4 days etc. I've left it for sooooo long, I finally came back when Chroma case came out. Now I go back to find the game not like it used to be. Screaming gamers. 12 year olds 'getting the game because they wanted to be cool'. Salty Casual people who rage at everything. And last but not least. Unboxing. I knew it would happen. Just like TF2 (Which is already ruined with hats and miscs and crates). The game I used to know has been ruined. People buying crates, unboxing, selling,skins, they run the place. Now, I'm here with people thinking there better then anyone. Now, of course I've fallen within that catergory, I've unboxed, bought skins and I feel guilty that the, happy, excited, me has fallen within this pathetic part of CS:GO. However, I still like the game, gamers still try to be the very best like no-one ever was. Others want to play for fun. Others want to be rich or make subscribers out of unboxing. I respect that. But, it annoys me how this is becoming a thing with 'MOST' Popular Valve Games, (not hl2). Now, all the people who dislike this review, I don't mind. People who likes this review agrees with me. I honestly don't want to have a fight in the comment section. So, I give this a. Thumbs Up. Because the gaming community can get better if we stop buying skins and just appreciate what a wonderful game is under there if we stop raging,unboxing,caring about trading. And look within what a awesome Game this was back when it came out. Thank You Valve For Making A Wonderful Game Within Crates And Unboxing.
Sharki;-;i reccomend all people to get this game, it is amazing!!!
GoldBot;-;After playing this game I learned how to speak perfect russian!
Jace;-;I waste my life shooting at people, missing and then getting shot at and killed. Then I cry for 8 hours and try again. Highly recommended.
Agathon;-;yeah this game is sick as bro, definantly not posting this to get a steam badge 4 levels #OneShotNoKIll
Swaggleberry Hummus;-;Got into a casual match and got kicked for being AFK. I just joined the game.
Bruffe;-;I think CS: GO is one of the best FPS games. You can play normal games and you can play competitive games. The competitive games are 5 vs 5 and by playing you get a rank. If you loose much your rank will decrease, and if you win much your rank will increase. You can buy weapons of the Steam Market for Steam Wallet money. You can watch streams of pros and tournaments.
ZombieSniper900;-;All my friends left my chats to play comp 10/10 would cry alone again
Disraeli Houses of the Holy;-;Very addictive but still fun, until you try the competitive mode. ing Russians... not all of them but most of them

lfheinn lfr;-;The best shooter game there is
kev;-;To heck with Hat Simulator 2, this is the new hotspot fellas. Be there or be square. There's skins you can buy for as low as 1 God damn cent (Yeah, like I have that kind of cash.) on the Steam marketplace, but there's also people willing to buy fancy-shmancy knives for over 400 dollars! Wow-whee! Those are the kind of fellas that must get a rad tan during the summer and get a lot girls at the town socials. Reminds me of my friend Rod. Rod used to own a '70 El Camino, but he crashed it into a ditch on the interstate. The air conditioner in it didn't work anyways, cause the car was like, forty years old at the time anyways, and he didn't have seat warmers so it was COMPLETELY useless. Rod's mom is cool, too. When I got sick and vomited in their fireplace, Rod's mom gave me a ride home and everything. I'll stop beating around the bush. Buy the game for cryin' out loud.
Raoul Duke;-;Your memes will be tested.
Soully;-;Honestly, this is literally the best game ever. Who needs Source when we got this?
Blue Jay;-;Pistol round, last one alive, got 4 kills , defused and got kicked by team. 10/10 would do again.

MaRXman;-;Pinnacle of the power of Valve. This game has evolved from potatoes running around with guns, into one of the best games PC has to offer. It has evolved me and what I define a game to be. I would buy this game at any price and considering 15 dollars for a game like this is just not needed. PC Heaven is just a few clicks away. You won't regret it I promise, so GO get your copy today!

Raptor_Vortexx;-;This game is thee most EPIC game i have ever played. It's really has the game potential, and structer! that it needs. It's really good were that when you shoot? You really need to focus on your target, where in Call of duty? it's really stupid when you spray and kill someone. That's what i enjoy, the aiming and the realistic movement is EXECELENT!
Mi1K;-;Game Is Called Global Offensive, Yet Only Seems To Come With Some Map Called Italy Or Something. Am told by Global Elites that there is one other map called De_DustII but nobody ever plays it. Jokes aside, this game is better than Source by a long shot, and I think over time it will get better than the 1.0-1.6 Glory days.
Rainbow Chicken;-;Well, now that I have, what was it, like 1 whole thousand hours in the game I can give it a fair review. I've been with this game for a long time now, since it was released, infact, and I don't regret it. Now, ofcourse, there are some pros and cons. I'm gonna carefully explain why I love this game, and why I hate it sometimes. Here we go. To start off, this game is great. And I mean "great" as in: it's highly competetive and it has a long learning curve, so you can't just hop in and wreck noobs right off the bat. You HAVE to learn the game to like it. For some, it may seem stupid and it makes the game less "accessible" for newer players, which is true, but it's a good thing. This game also has a ranking system, which is not always fair, and it may give a new player a higher rank, which then will be callibrated as he plays competetive games. Ofcourse, with a system like this, there are flaws. But I'll get into them later. This system has a thing called "Overwatch", which lets people decide which player seems like he's hacking, and so on. (Again, more on that later) Skins. It's all about skins these days, isn't it? Well, if you like wasting your hard earned money on cases, keys or already unpacked skins, this is the game for you. They give you the feeling of "awesomness", you feel invincible.. Ofcourse, it's only to the point where you get pounded in the  repeatedly by another player, but that's not the case. You can bet these skins, sell them and, really, do whatever you want with them. They give no extra stats to the guns, they're purely cosmetic. Now, we get into flaws. This game has alot of hackers. And I mean "ALOT". Not to the point where it's unplayable, and every single competetive game has a hacker, but to the point of "This is just ridiculous". Ofcourse, lower ranks have no hackers, but there are some "kids" who think that everyone who's better than them is hacking, and they just start blatantly using aimbot and wallhacks. About Overwatch. Ofcourse, the system is great, but just like any system out there, it has some flawes. To start off, let me say that this system is imperfect. It really is, most of the time people get banned wrongfully. I myself has been banned multiple times (on Smurf accounts. I'm against them, but I just like to play with my friends.) for 7 to 365 days. And trust me, I'm not a very good player, either. I want this system changed completely. Like, make it so people only can become "Investigators" when they're actually a high rank. Make it MG-DMG or something, and more than 200 games played, instead of 150. So, I started off by hoping to give this game a fair rating, so, here we go. This game is a strong 8/10 with some ballancing issues, but that's fixable. The developers listen to the public, and they're giving players what they want, and I like it. So, do you agree? Hit that like button, so the people will see it!

TubbyCustard;-;5 words... Buy As Soon As Possible, 10/10 one of the best competetive game's I have ever played. The experience you will receive in this game is endless, I have played almost 1000 hours and am still hopping on every day and playing almost all day. The only downside to this game is the anti cheat valve is using, yes they have created a system called overwatch to help with the hackers but in many of your competetive games you will see a hacker either on your team or the enemies. Now don't let this ruin the game for you because you can still try and the feeling you will receive when winning a game against a blatant hacker is awesome.

FengYunLong;-;CS:GO (Chicken Seeker: Guaranteed Offbase) is a game where you seek your lost chickens so that you can return to your farm. Using different mechanics to scare your chickens and herd them to different points on the map (Point A and Point B) is the objective of the game, you'll find that it's both fun and challenging to get your chickens there safely. Unfortunately, the multiplayer aspect of this game is full of people who find it fun to disrupt your game. It's almost impossible to spawn into the game without getting griefed by your fellow players, they will try their very best to kill both you and your chickens. The game itself is unmoderated and this behavior seems to go unpunished, the makers of the game seem to think this behavior is funny and have indulged the joke by coding the bots to grief in much the same way. Until this very serious problem is addressed I will have to give this a thumbs down. Only buy this game if you enjoy not being able to play your game due to a toxic community and incompetent developers who think such behavior is funny.
goku ssj7 on esf;-;BEST GAME EVER I LIKE ALL THE VALVE GAMES THERE AMIZING BEST
eXo - Kau jr no?;-;Well, first off all. I now know the russian language. I feel pretty comfy with russians now, since im getting forced to teamplay with those.. (Thats a good thing.. Right?) I think I should point something out of CS:GO. - Wannabe pros, who think everyone who kills 'em are hacking.. - Can people stop telling me what to do? - Alot of rage in this game, if you wanna do good every round. - Trolles, only because its "meta".. - Russians. - Russians. - Russians. - Russians... First thing first. The worst thing about this game, you some sort of need to communicate with your teammates, or I need that.. So im forced to learn fluent Russian, since they think the only language in this world is.. Russian.. After that being said, I can move on. People mocking around, telling me what to do is a D:/ Im doing it my way. You might disagree but I dont give a f**k. Trollers. Why is it cool to troll around? Derping to make you teammates rage.. I find it pretty common now adays.. Freakin spaaaaam.. -__- "Stfu, im hearing steps" Russian is not cool! After that being said im done. Some possitive feedback? Yeah.. Great FPS game with alot of tollerance. You need to aim quick, react quick and know each spot on each map. Great maps. You can always get better, and thats something I love. IMO, best FPS game right now. Love the competetive thing, with a different skill level in each rank. You arent a FPS lover before you own this game. BUYBUYBUY ;-) - See you around. eXo.

WaffleRekt | RECRUITING;-;I only have about 60 hours into this game so far, and I am only a Silver 1 at the moment, but so far, I can say I love this game. Since this is my first proper review, I'll just give separate ratings for each main aspect. Notice in this review I compare many aspects to Call of Duty. That is because CoD (IN MY OPINION) Gameplay - 9/10: Unlike games like Call of Duty, CS:GO takes skill, concentration, and communication. In competitive matches, which is obviously the main part of the game (correct me if I'm wrong), you absoulutely can NOT run off on your own and try to kill every enemy like people try to do in other FPS games. You have to talk with your team, plan your strategies, buy the right gun and play the right role. There is no "medkit." You cannot sit behind a box and wait for your health to regenerate. As for the guns, each different gun has different stats, such as damage, fire rate, and mobility. On top of the different stats, they also have recoil patterns that take a bit of time to learn and master. Unlike CoD, you cannot run around shooting and expecting to hit everything. Take the AWP for example. IN MY OPINION, it is the most widely used sniper in the game. One hit kill from the waist up (I think), except it is terribly inaccurate while moving or unscoped. This forces the user to scope and take time to practice their shots. Multiplayer - ?/10: As for the multiplayer, I cannot think of a proper score for this, as every person will have a different experience online. In half of my games, the players were toxic, cursing out teammates over the mic, calling people names, starting fights, and being flat out douches. In the other half, however, I really enjoyed playing and talking to the other players in the game. We communicated efficiently, even if we lost a round we wouldn't get mad at each other. In some of those games, people even offered to help improve another player's skill.

Tyrell;-;UMMM ITS A GOOD WAY TO GET STEAM FUNDS IF UR BROKE LIKE U CAN GET 6 PENNIES EVERY WEEK ITS LIKE HITTING THE JACKPOT
|SaW| M17CH M;-;This game is a very competitive and fast paced shooter that actually requires skill. Use of tactics, flashbangs, grenades and team work is very important in this game to succeed. There are hackers but usually not alot of them in the upper ranks MG1-GE. This game is an opportunity to play competitively with friends or other random people or to just mess about on deathmatch; either way, you'll have fun. :)
Roter;-;-Buy the game - Install the game - Kill 3 man with headshot - Enjoy your ban(on community servers) IGN - 10/10 BETTER THAN BATTLEFIELD PewDiePie 1/1 I just bought this game 4 nothing XDDDD BROS XDDD
Rhys | Simplexity-Gaming.org;-;Have you ever wanted to increase your hatred for russians? Or maybe learn fluent russian? Maybe spend 1.62 to open a crate and get 0.06 back This game is greate at increasing your rage and anger at people from other countries and is great to waste your cash!
WaffleRekt | RECRUITING;-;I only have about 60 hours into this game so far, and I am only a Silver 1 at the moment, but so far, I can say I love this game. Since this is my first proper review, I'll just give separate ratings for each main aspect. Notice in this review I compare many aspects to Call of Duty. That is because CoD (IN MY OPINION) Gameplay - 9/10: Unlike games like Call of Duty, CS:GO takes skill, concentration, and communication. In competitive matches, which is obviously the main part of the game (correct me if I'm wrong), you absoulutely can NOT run off on your own and try to kill every enemy like people try to do in other FPS games. You have to talk with your team, plan your strategies, buy the right gun and play the right role. There is no "medkit." You cannot sit behind a box and wait for your health to regenerate. As for the guns, each different gun has different stats, such as damage, fire rate, and mobility. On top of the different stats, they also have recoil patterns that take a bit of time to learn and master. Unlike CoD, you cannot run around shooting and expecting to hit everything. Take the AWP for example. IN MY OPINION, it is the most widely used sniper in the game. One hit kill from the waist up (I think), except it is terribly inaccurate while moving or unscoped. This forces the user to scope and take time to practice their shots. Multiplayer - ?/10: As for the multiplayer, I cannot think of a proper score for this, as every person will have a different experience online. In half of my games, the players were toxic, cursing out teammates over the mic, calling people names, starting fights, and being flat out douches. In the other half, however, I really enjoyed playing and talking to the other players in the game. We communicated efficiently, even if we lost a round we wouldn't get mad at each other. In some of those games, people even offered to help improve another player's skill. And no, not sarcastically, like: "Hey [player name], if you ever want to get some tips or anything, just message me and I'll be happy to help." (Actual message I got) Graphics - ??/??: I can't judge the graphics of this game. It's running off of an engine that's 5+ years old.

Jarl Zer0"Dovah";-;Counter Strike Global Offensive is a very good game, and you can even win items for some profit. I will jump right away to the pros and cons. Pros: -Steam Trading Cards. They do cost a nice amount of 6 cents, and you get a good amount from them from buying the game. -Accuracy improvement(sometimes) and some items to make your game more happy and colourful. -Settings allow you to change gameplay by a lot, HUD colours, minimap radar scale and much more! -You can even play 5 minutes if you are in a rush, and train your aim with other people. -A lot of community servers with a good amount of gamemodes and maps. -Overwatch for dedicated players. very good. no spoilerino spammerino. Cons: -You will get angry, occasionally. If you lose a "sure" shot on an enemy, you will daym. And even if he gets you with one shot without even any knowledge, you will call him a hacker. -Do not waste money on keys, really. It's a waste of time, and you can buy more games with that. Your luck may be with you, but you don't know. -People do spam a lot of their microphones and even have unlimited amount of reports to report anyone that is feeding, griefing or hacking. -Troll and griefing everywhere, people teamkilling you and they don't even get kicked. -----------------------------------| "Thanks ya for reading" -Zer0dg -| -----------------------------------|

SpuffyGotta;-;Alright Little late *cough* BUT a review Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and the entire Counterstrike series are amazing games it combines infinite user designed maps on custom servers for extreme amounts of fun, if you are not already interested in the competive mode the bare skin and bones of any counterstrike game to date. It is the core game inside this game that makes it so fun. The reason it it so fun is that urge to get better to be the best. Counter Strike is a game where you can always be better and there is always room for improvement and it is that skill and randomness of skill in the games even global elites the highest rank in the game. Can play like the lowest rank if they dont practice for say 3 months. It is that that makes Counter-Strike The game it is. Why we sink so many hours into the game. And why it is our favorite game. It is not for everyone... But it is for those people who strive to do better be the best and have a fun time with friends, through losses, and great victory... This is Counter-Strike:Global Offensive, and All CS. Buy it today.
BigBerthaBen;-;An amazing addition to the CS series, whith the series best graphics--whilst fast and easy on RAM/GPU systems, interface, and gameplay that is uncomparable to any of the other games. As the gameplay might be closer--it is a FPS--it still keeps the feel and play of CS with an additional amount of new feautres and cleaner HUD. The menu and interfaces in the game unique and works well and is quik and easy to get used to, without distracting or steering away from older/modern interfaces. As for the new official gamemodes for the game adds more hours and fun to the game versus source or any of the others.

bySeekOG|1TapMaster;-;Best game on steam N/A I r8 8/8 m8
TARS ^K.Flay;-;I played CS from 1.5 - started out when I was 12 or 13 I believe. Played 1.6 for years, went to live events and was by far my favorite game to play and watch. I remember the WCG in 2006 with Sweden vs Poland and how much I just loved the game. Eventually like everything, scene slowly died and between one thing and another stopped playing. In November of 2014 I wanted to give a shot at my favorite old FPS - which now was "CS:GO". Downloaded, tried it. At first I wasn't fully convinced due to the fact that I haven't played CS in ages and I was still used to 1.6, however - with some more time I started to like it. Watched Dreamhack final 2014, LDLC vs NiP and was glad to see familiar faces I knew from 1.6 like f0rest and get_right. I got hooked up once again and now it's for sure my favorite game yet again. There are some major things that need to be fixed like hitboxes, planting hitboxes, jumping hitboxes and ladder hitboxes. Valve needs to add 128 tick servers for match-making games and we need way more stats and in-depth graphs of our own performance on our profiles. Some weapon still needs some tweaking (AWP got nerfed too hard, hafl-way from now and older AWP would be perfect) and some pistols are still a bit too OP. All and all tho, even with these problems it's still a great game - however, if in the long run Valve doesn't take care of these major things and just keeps up the cosmetic side of CSGO I can see the community getting  in the long run, but they're smart so hopefully it won't happen. Overall I give this game a 8/10 - that could be a 9/10 if they fixed the hitboxes/weapons and a 10/10 if we had 128 tick servers and more analysis. Cheaters are a HUGE problem of this game, so I also hope that Valve would seriously expand the VAC team. I stopped playing mm for this reason now mostly 10mans and faceit.

Pupknuck;-;If it aint a hacker It's a smurf. If it aint a smurf It's a griefer If it aint a GRIEFER, I'm pretty sure it's a screaming toxic player If it aint a toxic player, it's a screaming kid. If they are none of the above... It's a russian teamate in a North American Server. * c*ka Bilat If it aint any of the above. it's a cooldown If it is a cooldown, it was probably because you crashed and had to restart your pc. If that aint it, you probably kicked on of the guys above too many times and you got one because of that. Or if you breathed...heh 0/10 cooldown simulator. 0/10 Russian:GO This game is butt cancer. If they fix matchmaking, and cooldowns, yeah cool. I highly doubt that they will. I really tried to enjoy this game, I put 667+ hours into it, I bought a knife (actually 3), but I quickly became bored when I met all the people above. I DO like this game for their map editor, that is probably the only reason why I would start it up anyway. I would just avoid the online toxicity. This is an honest review. Love it hate it, sweat on your keyboard and give me death threats....idc I don't like it. Sorry.

Revan The Bleeding Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

Kenickie;-;Classical game gone wrong, that's my summary at least. If you think the game is even at any point as good as 1.6 or CSS, think again. I'll list some pros and cons. Pros : Good looking skins. Remade maps. Easy to invite friends to a lobby/get a team farily quick. Modes like Arms race (Gun Game) or Deathmatch has been made official gamemodes. Cons : Community is rotten, way through, into the core and back on the other side. Ranking system is completly broken. Spraypatterns take long time to learn and master, especially AK-47. Can't select playable character in casual/competetive gamemodes,neither any other. People tend to buy the game on a different account, leveling up themself with that one so they meet people who are new, with themselfs as very skilled players. Cheating, when you see it you'll understand. Changed spraypatterns. Smaller, and somewhat broken, hitboxes. Wallbanging is rare. If Valve took time and developed a good ranking system this game could have been amazing, but no. The game is about 6 Euros on a steam sale, people buy it, Smurf, and destroy for all the other players. You need about 5 wins in a row to rank up one rank, every god damn time. It doesn't matter if you beat NiP or HeatoN himself, you won't rank up without 5 wins in a row. Good luck with that when the matchmaking isn't working properly because someone wanted to rank up twice. Until Valve fixes this problem, together with the cheating, this game is a big nono. Stick with 1.6 or Source, you'll have trice the fun you have here.

Hammylein @ twitchTV;-;I played for 3 hours. Had more fun then ever. Looks a lot better than CSS and AIMING is improved.. or equal 1.6 which is cool :)
Nasty_(Out of town);-;this is the best/worst game you can buy, its so much fun, there's so much dynamic to it, but if your stuck on a bad team you're going to hate your life for the next 45 minutes
le troll faic XD;-;you kill stuff until it dies
Nivekt;-;this game is sexy
Mooz.;-;Pew! Pew pew!! PEW PEW PEW! Pew pew! PEW! He's lit on cat.... oh wait, no... I didn't hit him. 7.6/10 would pew pew again

CaliW;-;buy this, no questions asked!
Headshot.exe;-;LUV IT!!!
Swagheti Yolognaise;-;A great game ! The decoy grenade ,the Incendiary and the different varieties of custom made guns has made this game yet another addictive sequel to CS 1.6 !
Doni"s;-;NIce game
Totoro;-;Its a very good game if your looking for a first person ego shooter where teamwork is needed to win. Also theres a huge market and a lot of trading going on, for those interested in that. Altough I mentioned the team work its actually not always needed since there are different modes(competitive etc.) Well I think its a great game and would definetely recommend it.
sjman =DD;-;Very good game, the game is very balanced and fun to play with friends except Reblg Ledaren and Russian people since they dont speak much english.
Nizam;-;This game needs a lot of skills and experience if u wanna become good at it 10/10
RAP GAME BOBBY HILL;-;I like manding futa, this game is god buy 10/10 hltv confirmed

akelov;-;There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back.

Igor;-;cool game :D
Penguinmilker;-;This game is autsim. 10/10
a real human bean;-;Full of 14 year old russians who are screaming 'idi na short bljad suka urod nahui!!' through their  10$ microphones. 10/10, would play again.
AndrewDell2471;-;Graphics and game play are much better than the Counter-Strikes before it... but like all other CS games, playing online can be a bit hectic. Ive played online only a few times and realized that I dont possess the patience needed to play with others in the CS community. There are some that are real great competitive players out there and others that are screaming kids that you have to mute.. but I assure you that I'm neither one those. So, I enjoy casual play offline with bots from time to time.
Hawk;-;One of the best games I have ever played..
Admiral.Pug;-;you dont know how epic is counter strike? so sad. i need no explaination for this one.
Elementary School Graduate;-;This game is extremely fun, especially with friends. I like the competitive side of this game, there is a lot of information to learn and if you really want to be great at this game, it becomes addicting.
!copyshit;-;Hmm.. This game is still in BETA to me. This game is true to its past, but that's not at all a good thing. This game needs its MM servers updated to 128 tick as many people believe aswell. They also need to work on their VAC system, less hackers would be nice but seeing on how they make money off them I dont see that being fix any time soon... but all in all it's an alright game with OK game play & the community is true to it's past.
C N X;-;Best game EVER!!!! ,but lot of HACKER !!!!
DETOXIFIED;-;Amazing Gunplay, Hard for new-commers, but once you learn how to successfully play and work as a team it makes CS:GO a memorable experience, this is the third installment to the famous Counter-Strike franchise and does not fail it. Competitive Mode is a must-play for any serious player. In Competitive, you are put against players with your same skill level and you must battle it out to see who is the best. This game is phenomenal, everything about it is great. 9.2/10 Awesome Game!

freiburg an der macht;-;This game was at the start ! But now after all these updates it is a game where you can have much fan and play with friends. In my opinion is CS 1.6 better but I need to go with the time and I need to play this. Buy it 10/10 would bang
partisan;-;I play this game is 450 days. Great continuation of the legendary game that won the hearts of millions. Well thought out gameplay for 15 years, new technology has allowed closer to real life. Updates are released every week, a huge permanent online (the largest in the world of paid games  100 000) do not let you get bored. My score prevailing during my games 92/100 This means that after the next update will be even better. Buy the game! This is the best game in its genre! And one of the best games in history!
StormyZone;-;This game is much more realistic.
Kloobz;-;Are we rushin' in, or are we goin' sneaky-beaky like?
GonzoRK;-;This is probably the best shooter ever made. CS:GO has anything that was in the previous versions of CS, plus it adds awesome skins and item drops like crates. If you're lucky enough you can get rare items dropped, which you then can sell on the market. That being said, you not only have an awesome shooter with millions of maps, plenty game mods and brilliant matchmaking. In CS:GO you also have a cash-cow. Go idling, milk the cow, if you're lucky you'll get an awp skin. Or a knife model. In that case, you can quit your job and lay back.
m0ntag;-;Classic Counter-Strike for the modern age. Taking the feel and style of 1.6 with the graphical and technical improvements of Source, CS:GO makes a strong case to be the best Counter-Strike. A well done matchmaking system makes it easy to find matches with stock rules. This is furthered by the ability to choose between casual rules for when you want to practice and ranked competetitve mode with the original rules. And, should you still want the modded community servers, it's got that too. The eSports Community is alive and well with events like Dreamhack and multiple other major tournaments with massive prize pools, drawing in the top teams from around the world. Counter-Strike:Global Offensive also introduces a weapon skin drop system for customization and seasonal passes to support mapmakers. All in all, this is the best of Source and the best of 1.6 mashed together into one shiny, fluid, and amazing game. If you only are going to get one Counter-Strike, this is the one to get.
Bryars;-;If you're not already playing it religiously, you should. CS:GO is the best damn game available on the PC right now. I know, it's sad that nothing can compete with Counter-Strike for over 12 years now, but that's the way it is. You don't want to be some kind of a scrub who's bad at competitive online games, right? They'll call you a n00b and a scrub and make fun of you if you don't get good at this game. So stop wasting your time playing casual garbage and pick up this game right now.

MaZerino Kapparino Cappucino;-;Best FPS game for me! :) Superb graphic. CS Player from Czero till CS:Go!
Mr.Crowly;-;Perfect
DirtyHarry07;-;This game is so fun to play if you've played CSS (Counter Strike Source) then you will love CS:GO with the awesome graphics which make the game fun and the slight realism towards the game "By contrast, CS is totally egalitarian. Everyone has access to the same items, and players aren't ranked. Nobody cares if you play four hours a day, seven days a week. All that matters is how well you negotiate the next firefight. You might take out half of the enemy team... but then again, a much less skilled player might blind you with a flashbang grenade and unload his top-of-the-line shotgun into your skull. It's not unusual to see a good player climb to the top of the scoreboard only to decline back into mediocrity. In CS, skill and alertness are your primary weaponsand when you get tired, there are no unlockables to help you keep your edge."
Ultradar.;-;How to learn Russian in a day. And how to get banned for 90% of the time you play because your team are a bunch of numb nuts.

H4CK3D;-;So after playing Counter Strike for about 1 year now and putting over 1000 hours into it, I thought I would make a little review. Throughout the time i've played I've seen many Good/Bad changes made to the game. I still think some of the changes are a little stupid but I've come to get used to it. Although there are a lot of cheaters I still manage to have fun. Whenever I encounter a cheater I just laugh and mess around with them, because it's funny to think people would waste 15$ on re-buying the game for multiple accounts to cheat on. I was recently reading a reddit post by a proffesional CS:GO player by the name of DaZeD in where he mentions a way that can reduce cheaters by a mass amount of numbers. He basically stated that CS:GO should add a system so that the first 50 queues are unranked so the cheaters would basically be going against other cheaters. He also said that after you finish the first 50 queues you can start playing for ranks and start playing on 128 tic servers. I agree with all of what he said. This was originally going to be a small review and it turned into a little over a paragraph. If you actually read all of this and have any opinions leave a comment letting me know, and I'll try to get back to you.
Seraveem;-;Exciting competitive mode, recommended if playing with friends.

Chosen Unbread;-;Every Friday after I recieve my paycheck I deposit it. Saturday mornings I wake up not remebering the previous night with a headache and a sore . I roll out of my bed on to the floor and pick myself up just enough to click play on CSGO, I spend the time that it takes me to load CSGO (NO SSD MASTER RACE HERE) getting up from my starting position to sit in my chair (very hard to do with a wrecked bottom) Naturally at this time I start to remeber certain details about the previous night. I check my phone, a text from my bank, I've overdrawn. My Foggy bits and pieces start to clear and gradually turn to horror as I see a little yellow box with a 10 in it under the word inventory, and a message telling me i have new items. I click inventory as i am suddenly overcome with the dawning realization of my previous nights activities as my shiny new Stat Trak skins bounce into view on my screen. so much red. I lose control of my bowels and also vomit all over my keyboard and screen then pass out. If you buy this game. it would be smart to also buy some lube, in bulk, Dont play CSGO if you dont want your anal region violated again and again. game mechanics .... crap teamwork... crap community of friendly people for beginners... crap but u can buy skins for your gunz to make them look pretty so you spend your entire time distracted by the colors while you get shot at and lose the game for your team Valve is a cruel, cruel mistress. I Can't ING WAIT FOR SATURDAY MORNING. 10/10 will buy lube again.
starwatcher1;-;Great game. Simple(no perks, unlocks, kill streaks) skill based first person shooting action that's still very hard to beat. Highly recommended.

Gonah;-;It started back in the 8th grade when I was put in ELL. I was surrounded by  and no matter how much I begged the principal to let me out of there he kept telling me I was also  and there was no way I would suceed in life. I spent days in the ELL classroom learning with people I hated and puzzles I couldn't solve. Coloring inside the lines was not only unacheiveable but I had to watch the coolest kid in ELL Eli Chubin do every day. It wasn't fair I wasn't like the rest of these kids I could do 20 pull ups! If the principal wouldn't advance me to regular classes I would have to it myself. Using the problem solving skills that landed me in ELL I devised the plan to kill every other person in the class because then I have to be moved up, I mean they couldn't have a class just for 1 person right? I searched online to find out how other people did mass murders and it seemed like the most efficient way was with shooting the place up so I decided that was what I would do. I didn't know where to start though so I searched online once again to find out how all these murderers started. I quickly learned that it was violent video games was the thing that all these murderers had in common so I decided that must be the thing that makes killers. I then bought Counter Strike as I heard you could learn how to be a terrorist and played it every day after school. After a week of playing I felt the evil inside of me and I was ready to shoot up the school. Using what I had learned from Counter Strike and the guns I borrowed from my father I went into ELL that day and killed every kid in my class. As a result of that I got moved up into regular classes just like I hoped would happen. Without Counter Strike I would still be in ELL to this day.
Maximum Magz;-;This game right here its almost as good as league of legends of course there isnt a game better then league of legends but this is pretty close second if your black u will do better in this gme so for my black ppl out there we got a game we can win at other then madden and gta last but not least if u want to get better at this game u gotta get me all of the cases in the world so gift me cases and we will all be happy great game i recomended it to all and xpeacially blacks wooooooooooooooooooooooo gg no re
little bit more gay;-;I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of this game. 1/10 score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Valve Game Submission Contract. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Terrorist slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But two years later, the Terrorist is still is not free. Two years later, the life of the Terrorist is still sadly crippled by the manacles of the M4A1-S and the chains of Counter-Terrorists. Two years later, the Terrorist lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. Two years later, the Terrorist is still languished in the corners of Counter-Terrorist society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Trade-Up Contract, they were signing a promissory note to which every player was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, Terrorist men as well as Counter-Terrorist men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable Rights" of "Deagle, AWP, and the pursuit of Bomb Sites." It is obvious today that Counter Strike has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her players of Terrorism are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, Counter Strike has given the Terrorist people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds." But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this game. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of Deagle and the security of AWP. 10/10 would let freedom ring again
Reggit;-;In this game you can point and click to kill people, and win a free iPhone*! It also features many great maps including Dust II and Dust II. This game can be very difficult for new players as it features people who are really good, they can get running head shots with an ak-47 from CT to B double doors on the best map, Dust II. It also features a skin system similar to TF 2's item system but skins aren't really usefull they just look nice, and allow you to show off how much money you can throw at people. *No iPhones can actually be won from playing this game, major rage and saddness may occur, please seek a medical proffesional before deciding to use this product.
ImportedBanana;-;CS:GO is my favorite game on steam so far. As far as competitive gaming goes, look no further than Counter-strike or Dota. Counter-strike is a game where the outcome is based on each player's skill, reaction time, and TEAMWORK! Communication with your fellow soldiers is crucial to win. Calling strategies, reporting enemy whereabouts, and working closely with teammates makes this game more immersive than most PC shooters. Make sure you follow your team's economy to decide what gear to buy at the right times. Learn common locations on all the maps so you can keep your team aware of all happenings around them. It also helps that the game's mechanics are about as fluid as it gets! Have fun.

Revan The Bleeding Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

HAS312e;-;Counter Strike Global Offensive - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=172418491 CSGO is developed by Hidden Path Entertainment, CSGO may follow the same old formula of gameplay seen in previous versions of Counter-Strike CSGO, is very easy to get into, it's noob friendly, easy to play, easy to learn to speak Russian. There are new things added: > 3 new game modes > New maps, New updated old ones > weapon finishes(cemos) for each individual weapons > crates and > stickers(emblem), This game includes new modes, like Arms Race, Demolition,Deathmatch, there are 2 main original modes Casual Mode up to 20 players and Competitive 5v5. The environment looks fantastic and realistic on each maps, there are more maps being added and old ones being updated on every new "Operations" Level Design: It is more improved from the previous CS with better map designs, each maps has different strategy, and you have to plan your move Items: The "items" you'll get are through drops, that functions the same as TF2 and Dota 2 you'll get random crates, stickers and cemos, from every match you play or when you rank up, However stickers are non customizable, and it's based on the "community made workshop" made by the community and some are made by profesionals. Control: CSGO has fast shooter controls, it's very responsive, it's very fast-paced.The weapons are very well balanced from different types. Each weapons has a different handling. On the UI side, CSGO is more improved, it's has a new clear purchase menu, an easy way to buy weapons. All weapons has a different handling Verdict Overall, CSGO is good game, it has a better level design than the previous Counter-Strike, it's noob friendly and very challenging at times, it's more improved from the previous versions of Counter-Strikes. CSGO will always stay to true to the core. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=196702322 Note: I do not own the rights the some of these images

Revec;-;the game is awseome...., i love it and i tend to play it every day :P, but the connection finder or hosting, sometimes is bad. so u chould some how figure it out ! :D thnx !
Cherry;-;This my jam
beemer #nosound;-;There are so many things to say about this game but so little time. As im struggling to find words with mixed feelings about this game, it is hard to give it a review. Let me just make a pro/con list. Pros: -team based playing (seriously this isnt ing call of duty) -guns aren't easy to use (why is this a pro? so kids on call of duty dont play) -variety of weapons, there is a gun for everyone - the rank system is very well done and its hard to level up. (this is good because ur skill level means alot more then OMG I JUST REACHED 4TH PRESTIGE BY GETTING 360 TOMAHAWK KILLS) -There is competetive for the serious ones and casual (like me) for the ones who aren't serious -its ing valve, they are going to suck you into this game faster then ur mom sucked me off last night Cons: -ing p90s -ing autos -ing novas -ing random headshots -ing smurfs -ing hackers -ing guys with twitch.tv/9324ui0tj0239jg023 in their name -ing OK GUYS KNIVES ONLY SERVER DO IT OR BE KICKED -ing guys who are afk in casual when one team has 7 wins and u cannot kick him -ing hackers/boosters with their friend and u try to kick the hacker/booster but it needs to be a unaminous vote and the booster obviously says no -ing dust2 -ing dust11 -ing unaminous vote on dust11 7 games in a row -ing valve not letting us use fpsbanana to get skins but rather skillfully persuade us to buy their skins for high prices so we can give it names like " u " -when your playing on a casual server and you think no one has a mic until a girl talks then out of a sudden everyone is talking about how strong their biceps are -ing kids who think they are the best ing dj in the world who play songs that no one likes with their   turtlebeach microphones -ing kids who lead their team in casual like they are commanding the 97th battalion into france on d-day ing kids who ask for free skins on casual, but you see that they have an inventory with about 20$ and they refuse to sell any of those to get a 20 cent skin. -ign valve for making us pay for missions and we always say "oh were not going to buy that stupid " but we find ourselves buying it anyway -ing volvo making me put up my morgage on the community market because I need to get that karambit fade factory new statrak souvenir -ing volvo for sucking me into this game for 700 hours and 699 of those hours playing dust2 In retrospect I believe that with all that has been said, If you see urself playing this like an hour a day and then quitting (IF U CAN DO THAT PLEASE TEACH ME UR WAYS), buy this game. However, if u are easily sucked into games and are already thinking of buying some skins even before getting the game. DO NOT ING BUY IT HOLY . WHEN U SEE HOW PATHETIC U ARE WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY U SPENT ON VIRTUAL ITEMS AND U ARE ASHAMED BY HOW MANY HOURS YOU PLAYED IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS THAT U HAVE TO MAKE YOUR PROFILE PRIVATE, then u will realize what im talking about. gg hf :(
Hunt3r;-;Amazing,fascinating and really well made piece of work,just like all other Valve games. But in my opinion (as well as the half of the earth's population's opinion) skins are kind of "overpriced" . But,I guess there is nothing we can do about that,cause video game companies have to "milk" money from gamers somehow.

Quarantine^;-;It is a pure e-sports ...
ErrorJIC;-;A full upgrade over its predecessor Counter-Strike: Source, Global Offensive manages to revive its playerbase that was lost from the previous game and (as always) introduces new players to the franchise. If I were to briefly describe it, I'd say it's a "Modern Day Classic". There are 4 modes: The main 2 are Casual and Competitive, while the other 2 are Arms Race (Gun game) and Demolition (like Gun game but a kill awards only 1 weapon to be used in the next round). There is also a Deathmatch mode, basicaly TDM with quick respawns, that is usually used for practising different weapons. With the Arms Deal update, which introduced camos and some weapons to the game, there are drops at the end of matches and it slightly feels like TF2, but not to that extent. The Matchmaking system is kind of "meh", although it is much better than some other games I've played. In Competitive, there is a 50-50 chance for you to join a balanced game without your team being on a losing streak (that is if you go solo....it's quite a gamble...). There are also some minor hitreg issues that are barely noticable but still important enough to determine the outcome of the round and that's freaking annoying (64 tick....). If you intend to take this game seriously, you can join a competitive team (5 people) and spend time practising recoils patterns and the like. Who knows! You might end up entering a tournament! As far as game content is concerned, new guns and camos are constantly being added to the game. Plus, Valve introduces Operations (Last one was Operation Vanguard) that include a handful of new maps from the workshop. After about 4-5 months the Operation ends and the most popular maps have a chance to get the main game while some others pass on to the next Operation. The thing is, that this counts as DLC and will set you back 6$ if you are willing buy it from the start. The price drops over time so I suggest entering when it is about a dollar or so. Overall, with the price of 11 (~15$) it's much more than you pay for and with more than 800 hours currently in the game, I can safely say I'm very satisfied. Great game 9.5/10.
Ultralife;-;Great game, always been the best competetive shooter out there.. follow it since the beginning!!
unknowN;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, is probably the most balanced Fps game in all existence. I personally started playing Counter Strike when Source had been out for 2-3 years or so.

A pro player will have no statistic advantage over a gamer that's new to the series, other than his skill. +Great Engine +Great Servers +Balanced Gameplay +Smooth Gameplay +Excellently constructed maps +Stays true to the franchise +Cheap -No unlockables (except skins) -InGame purchases with real money 16/03/2014
TGK TheRick;-;I don't like a lot of Counter-Strike game but this game is nice. It has some cool "games". It is very funny :D If you like Counter-Strike you should buy it. It is a MUST for all CS-fans If you liked this REVIEW please say yes with a THUMB UP (like) . Thanks 10/10
Sample_Loli69 (   );-;Wasted 15$ to buy this, not even in a sale. Wasted money to buy keys. Yep, only blues. and blues. and blues. No Knife. No Trade-Up Contract to get knife. Played over 300 hours. Nova 1. Yep, look at my friend, played 150 hours. Almost Nova 1. Meet tons of Russians. Now I know more languages. Thank you CS:GO. 69/420 would tell my friends to buy this game P/S: Silvers are salty.
DokazS;-;Awesome <3 I R8 8/8 M8
JDNumeroOcho;-;Since I haven't seen really any serious or informative reviews for this game, I decided to write a review on my impressions or competitive play and the community, 50 hours in, as well as go over the basics of the game. Counter trike: Global Offensive is a competitve multiplayer FPS and the newest installment in the Counter strike series. The game was made to be played competitively, which can be enjoyable with a good group of guys. The competitive game mode consists of a best of 30 rounds, half of them being played as counter-terrorists, the others as terrorists. The goal as terrorists is to plant the bomb or kill all of the counter-terrorists, when the goal of counter-terrorists is to kill all of the terrorists or defuse the bomb if it was planted. This game is in no way a twitch shooter (as in he who shoots first wins) and requires marksmanship and strategy, unlike some other popular FPS games. Competitive mode reqiers a full five man team to win. (Not literally, but if someone on your team is a bad sport, not listening, or is a bot, you're almost guaranteed to lose) If you want a serious game almost every time, I recommend playing with atleast 1 or 2 friends of the same skill level. Playing with serious players is a lot of fun, and for the most part people are good sports in the game. Instead of yelling "Wow you didn't clutch F**k you man" You will usually hear "Good try man, we'll get this next round", but sometimes you will hear the first quote. I've made some good friends playing counter strike, and it was worth it. This game takes alot of practice, skill and strategy but once you get it down, it can give you literally 1,000s of hours playing.
smithichie;-;This game makes me cry.
[UMCS]Cubrick;-;This game does a lot.... a lot of good things ... and a lot bad things.... The good things: - you will learn in a short amount of time , with no real effort, this language of epic proportions called russian - if you are lucky, you get to enjoy the game as you escape everytime with 1 hp. You lucky ! - don't spend a single cent and you get to be a millionaire. - random noob who just purchased the game, gets a key as a birthday present, opens the case, and receives a knife stattrak that is not even on market. GOOD JOB RANDOM NOOB - you will laugh at the inexplicable trails of shots - you will cry a lot The bad things: - the amount of hackers in this game is astounding. More hackers appear every day than Valve manages to ban every year. - if you're not lucky, you get to stay dead because your enemy escaped with 1 hp. Happens every round you know, unless you get an AWP ..........and do 6 damage in 1 hit with it.. How is that even posibrr? - getting kicked for not grasping the russian language and not rushing as a CT on defuse maps. - getting kicked for trying to 1v5 and not rushing as T on hostage maps like your fellow russians did. - ruins friendships. Had to delete all my csgo friends. Thanks Valve. Should of made Half-life 3 instead. - you will get tainted by those guys whom you learnt russian from.           - spend money and enjoy being bankrupt. - a guy who wasted more time playing this game than spending it with his girlfriend, sells his waifu with big boobs to buy a million keys for a chance at a  texture on a virtual item, no knife drop. GJ Now go buy a real one, which is cheaper you know, and kill yourself. RANDOM NOOB WINS - you will cry at the inexplicable trails of shots - you will cry a lot Long story short: You will cry a lot.
canne;-;Reallly good game you should get it
Dr. Von Goosewing;-;If you want to understand why the human race will not survive long term, then look no further than this game. To say the community is toxic is a bit like saying Escobar did ok in the drug business. You will come across cheats, racists, cheats, kids, cheats, and cheats. Before long the hate will rise inside you, work and family will seem less important than ranking up, you will discover that somehow you can curse fluently in Russian, if anybody plays better than you they must be reported for cheating, and you live only for your next knife kill... after which you scream "rekt!!". New players should not be afraid of losing their first few games. You will find the skill tree a little messed up. High ranking players often have alternate accounts so they can dominate lower ranks for fun. If you are a silver or nova then congratulations, you are almost certainly playing more global elites than actual global elites. If you ever make it out of that hellhole things will get easier, trust me. Good luck, and may God have mercy on you noob. 10/10 c*ka blyat.
bEKuli;-;When started to play this game, a new life has begun for me. 11/10
Jary Mane;-;It's the follow-up to the groundbreaking FPS series "Counter-Strike". And it's brilliant. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive retains the same classic feeling of Counter-Strike and does it while strutting it's stuff. I can remember playing Counter-Strike 1.6 when I was but a small child, and I still have fond memories of it. The graphics feel appropriate, and I love the art style. The fandom for this game still grows strong today, and I can't imagine the funds that it's raised for Valve & it's employees. Good job, guys. Hopefully there may be more to come in the series.
Christie Moore;-;Nothing good to actually say about the game. Just play it because everyone else is.
ON VACATION 3;-;Okay i have once made a account for a programm called "steam" back in 2003 Than i forgot for it. And some weeks back friend was like CS:GO is "fun" so i bought it. Since i bought it these things happend. - I speak fluent russian and some basic skills in swedish and other scandinavian languages. - Now i am taking russian class and guess what i am the alpha nerd who gets the a+ - Sun whats that can you touch that? Ah yeah there was something back than hmm... - OMG look at that nice Gun Skin puts in CC Number R.I.P 400 - I got many friends now online :) but IRL all are gone why? :( 10/10 if you know what ". ." means you already own the game. If not get it right ing now.
BOODIEMAN;-;This game ruined my identity, it led me to drive away everyone i've ever loved and made me resent myself. 10/10 Must buy.

beardATTACK * fren;-;On Counter-Strike: Global Offensive since the announcement lay a huge responsibility. After all, the continuation of the legendary series of online shooters , a fan is a vast community will not tolerate the slag or just serednyachkovoy game. Benefit , Valve and not the studio that dares to disappoint their fans. Two years later, the clockwise and 691 held in opposition to the special forces and terrorists , I can proudly say that CS: GO is really failed. Even more than . Before continuing my review , it is worth noting that the only worthwhile game mode and remains to this day a bomb clearance , ie confrontation 5x5 , 30 rounds of 1 min. 45 sec. , In which the attacker must detonate a bomb at certain points , and protection appropriate to allow this to happen. One of the major advantages is the fact that CS: GO this type of game ( with minor changes ) placed in a separate section of the menu called ' competitive mode ' . Introduced a system of titles that helps you find a match according to your skill. In CS 1.6 and CS: Source competitive mode by default absent and was available only on certain servers , specially tuned for this type of game. The gameplay is not changed . Actually , nothing changed and is not required , a familiar mechanic works on hurray . Fixed characteristics of some weapons , something removed, something added to the overall picture it does not have nearly no effect. Shooting became more random, yes. But perhaps the most realistic FPS in the moment. If multiplayer shooter from you wait not fancy graphics and ballistics believable and interesting gameplay, then welcome to the CS: GO. Valve managed to make an almost perfect balance of gaming devices. With proper skill you can neutralize the enemy with a much more powerful weapon . Pistol rounds in CS: GO is not known to sink without a chance and an opportunity to take the round even with poor economies . But the most important advantage is the ratio of Valve to his fans . Almost every week there is a free upgrade , changing the gameplay for the better, in order to achieve a perfect balance . Approximately every six months out extensive additions cost 5-7 dollars with soccer fans cards that are available in the competitive mode. That's not counting skins for weapons that can get special opening drawers. In addition to all Valve maintains its competitive community , sponsoring tournaments large sums . And I am delighted that the number of people playing CS: GO, is increasing every day . But on the other hand it is the community CS was for me the only problem in this game. Because it often turns into a competitive mode into a farce and mutual humiliation. The only solution - only play with friends. Total we have a great continuation of one of the greatest franchises in history. To purchase required if gaming is important to you the gameplay itself . Best multiplayer shooter at this point, in my opinion. - beardATTACK @ fren

63e CSDup;-;"It's like Skyrim with guns!" - IGN The game really does offer the decisive RPG role that very little First-Person games offer. Unfortunately, it incorporates a lot of mechanics from the popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft and can at times feel like a complete clone. If you haven't played WoW, you will enjoy it, but if you have you will feel some obvious and uncomfortable similarities. The game's singleplayer is really expansive and really allows the player to explore the mystical world, known as "Pandora" and offers you to play as 1 of 4(at one given time) playable characters, all with unique personalities and trates. Brick - A slow tanky character, who at times can seem very stupid but as the game progresses his soft side opens up and you can see him as a caring personality. Roland - A military-type, honorable character who at times can seem like a pervert, who spies on young children. You can often find him stealing other characters televisions and smoking blunts. Mordecai - The only homosexual member of the group, can be found in massive orgies. His fetish is bleeding anuses. Lilith - A complete autistic, psychopath who can be found having sex with skags and fondling herself. The characters enrole in the US military, where they will fight their way throughout a Chinese insurgency. The campaign really demonstrates the power of the games "Frostbite 3 engine" and really drops the players jaw at any given moment. The multiplayer can be described as "Call of Duty with swords" and offers 4 playable classes, Knight, Vanguard, Man at arms and Archer. All of which are equally effective in the art of combat. The mutliplayer takes place in 14th century Europe where being heterosexual was a crime and gay orgies were public(which later resulted in the spread of the black plague) so don't let your kids play, because they might immitate the gay orgies that the NPC's participate in. The community is made up of 12 year olds using their mothers' laptops. 15/10 its ok. In all actuality this game isn't as great as everyone says it is. Honestly, it has less depth than CoD, and an even worse community. Yes, a community of people with superiority complexes because they play a FPS that's not CoD. Think Battlefield community, except with people who think they're super pro leet. As far as gameplay goes, it's solid, and the maps are probably the best part of this game. Other than that, dull, repetitive, and has a  matchmaking system. 6/10
Cpt.L@TOUNG@,etC;-;I really like Counter Strike, and this entry is no exepcion, everything is good now and it has a lot more room for expansion. But please, create an East Server so the rest of Europe can have more fun while playing... For more than 20 game in streak, I only listen to Russian, and since a medium percentage of them hates "America", they refuse to speak English, and this is totally unsocial and breaks the communication in game, ending up to a serious problem that leads the player into frustation and despair, summing up in a deffeat... This is the dark side of the community in the CS:GO scene and it can be easily resolved by creating a new Server. With this said I'm not being racist since I'm not that and I have friends in all over the world, but it hurts the community to see the player personal beliefs and cultural influences get inside a game, that is used to relief stress and to socialize a bit more with the world. Dramatic actions should be insued Lord Gabe, just make it happen...
Naji;-;This game has the best Chicken AI of gaming history. 10/10 would knife those chickens again. CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play, where you play 10 games that you cannot leave (unless you want to tarnish your reputation), after which you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair no matter what skill level you are. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO. This game has the best Chicken AI of gaming history. 10/10 would knife those chickens again.
ErrorJIC;-;A full upgrade over its predecessor Counter-Strike: Source, Global Offensive manages to revive its playerbase that was lost from the previous game and (as always) introduces new players to the franchise. If I were to briefly describe it, I'd say it's a "Modern Day Classic". There are 4 modes: The main 2 are Casual and Competitive, while the other 2 are Arms Race (Gun game) and Demolition (like Gun game but a kill awards only 1 weapon to be used in the next round). There is also a Deathmatch mode, basicaly TDM with quick respawns, that is usually used for practising different weapons. With the Arms Deal update, which introduced camos and some weapons to the game, there are drops at the end of matches and it slightly feels like TF2, but not to that extent. The Matchmaking system is kind of "meh", although it is much better than some other games I've played. In Competitive, there is a 50-50 chance for you to join a balanced game without your team being on a losing streak (that is if you go solo....it's quite a gamble...). There are also some minor hitreg issues that are barely noticable but still important enough to determine the outcome of the round and that's freaking annoying (64 tick....). If you intend to take this game seriously, you can join a competitive team (5 people) and spend time practising recoils patterns and the like. Who knows! You might end up entering a tournament! As far as game content is concerned, new guns and camos are constantly being added to the game. Plus, Valve introduces Operations (Last one was Operation Vanguard) that include a handful of new maps from the workshop. After about 4-5 months the Operation ends and the most popular maps have a chance to get the main game while some others pass on to the next Operation. The thing is, that this counts as DLC and will set you back 6$ if you are willing buy it from the start. The price drops over time so I suggest entering when it is about a dollar or so. Overall, with the price of 11 (~15$) it's much more than you pay for and with more than 800 hours currently in the game, I can safely say I'm very satisfied. Great game 9.5/10.
Your friend, Patrick Bateman;-;After being around CS since the olden days, back when we had WONIDs and such...this is a drastic change. In a good way. I still kept playing 1.6 for awhile, even after CSS was released, my PC couldn't handle it, but I was more than satisfied with what 1.6 had to offer. Once I upgraded my PC and was able to jump into CSS, it was nto what I..expected. It did not go over well with the way I had gotten used to CS 1.6. I stopped playing CSS and went back to 1.6. I got into the beta of CS GO once it was announced, tried out ok: Ok, seems to work like 1.6, but with CSS visual..this is nice. The game actually plays very well, it does have some drastic changes from what we <1.6 vets remember. I think Wayne Campbell said it best: In many ways it's superior but will never be as recognized as the original. It's a great step up from the original, take the first step, I know it's frightening, but trust me, you'll like it.
63e CSDup;-;"It's like Skyrim with guns!" - IGN The game really does offer the decisive RPG role that very little First-Person games offer.

Sinestra;-;This game is cool. It has guns. I shoot people and such.
^HaYz;-;Great gmae recomended it to all
Blazebeak;-;I ignored this game for so long hoping it would get better but it hasn't. It shockingly got even worse. Before I start lets get into the history of Counter Strike. The Original CS was a fun competitive game that still remains superior to it's sequel, CS:source. CS:source was popular mainly because of the large amounts of custom maps that were flooded into the game but killed competitive CS and turned the game into a casual shooter. Then CS:GO came. This game was made solely for micro transactions, but to be honest any game made by valve will be from now on. But the game has no major changes from cs:source other than skins and cosmetics. Furthermore these weapon skins and cosmetics feel like something that fits more in tf2. Bright pink guns and meme stickers make me want to vomit. But hey, if you want to spend $300 on a knife skin that you will never use or get a kill on be my guest. Another problem are the guns. None of them are balanced in the game. Most famous one being the awp, the 1 shot 1 kill weapon. And last we have the matchmaking. It is some of the worst matchmaking I have ever seen. Any game where it takes over 5min. to get into a match fails, and cs:go has no excuse seeing as how as of this review it is the second most played game on steam. And lastly the main reason I hate this game, is the community. So I was on a server, everyone was dead. It was me vs. the entire other team and as you would guess, I died. Then some squeaker yells over the mic "what the f#ck you idiot!" and starts a vote kick on me that passed. The other way around happened where I hid in a corner no one checked and shot the entire enemy team and won and I get "You f#cking hacker!" and get kicked. This stuff is normal when you play this game because 75% of everyone playing it is some annoying kid with some kind of meme name. On top of that this game is full of Russians that like to yell. A lot. Now you would think that when you play on a west coast server Russians wouldn't join because bad ping, but they do. And then you would KNOW Russians wouldn't join on an east coast server because it is on the other side of the world and they would get the worst possible ping, but they still do. It's almost as if they are only joining these games so they can yell at people and not play the game at all. 30% of all the nearby servers, at least where I live, are idle servers and even then there aren't that many servers to begin with and it confuses me because this game has pretty much the same amount of servers as tf2 even though there are a lot more people who play this, at least to what steam says in their stats. And lastly this game is full of cheaters. And having a ranking system where you get better ranks depending on your k/d ratio will always make more dumb kids want to cheat. And having next to no defenses against kids cheating because you can almost never confirm if this kid is hacking or just lucky because you pretty much instantly die if you get shot in the head with any weapon. This game it is best used just to idle for the chance of getting a drop you can sell for 30$. With that said I'm done. I would like to remind anyone reading this that this is my opinion of the game and everyone has different opinions. And yes, ik, my opinion is sht and i'm an under-aged-pleb that clearly knows nothing about video games. No need to sprinkle your salt in the comments.
Th3HaloGam3r;-;This game is absolutely spotless. I recommend it.
G-Drag0n;-;Cool game!.. :D
P90 RUSH MID;-;An excellent captivating first person shooter that all ways leaves you coming back for more.

T1TAN;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (abbreviated as CS:GO) is an online tactical first-person shooter developed by Valve Corporation and Hidden Path Entertainment, who also maintained Counter-Strike: Source after its release. It is the fourth game in the main Counter-Strike franchise. Counter Strike Global Offensive was released on August 21, 2012, and made available for Microsoft Windows and OS X on Steam, Xbox Live Arcade, and a US-only version on PlayStation Network.The Linux version was released in September 2014.It features classic content, such as revamped versions of classic maps; as well as brand new maps, characters and game modes. Cross-platform multiplayer was planned between Windows, OS X and PSN players, but was ultimately limited to Windows and OS X because of the differences in update-frequency between systems.The PSN version offers three input control methods, which include using either the DualShock 3 controller, PlayStation Move or USB keyboard/mouse. Like the previous games in the series, Global Offensive is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter. Each player joins either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist team and attempts to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team. The game operates in short rounds that end when all players on one side are dead or a team's objective is completed. For most game modes, once a player dies, they must wait until the round ends to respawn. Players purchase weapons and equipment at the beginning of every round with money awarded based on their performance. Completing objectives or killing enemies earns the player money while negative actions, like killing a teammate or hostage, takes money away from the player. In addition, when a round ends all players receive some amount of money, with players on the winning team receiving substantially more. Counter Strike: Global Offensive adds new weapons and equipment not seen in previous installments, most notably the firebomb for each side (Molotovs for Terrorists and incendiary grenades for Counter-Terrorists). These temporarily cover a small area in fire, dealing damage to anyone passing through. Currently, Global Offensive features five game modes for online play: Counter-Strike 's most well-known game mode, both involving Bomb Scenario and Hostage Scenario missions.At the start of each round, players can purchase weapons and gear with money earned from various actions, from assisting on kills to completing objectives. Regardless of mission type, a round ends when one team completes an objective, eliminates the other team, or lets the timer run out. Bomb Scenario: the Terrorists must plant a C4 explosive at one of two designated bombsites; the Counter-Terrorists must prevent the bomb from exploding, either ensuring that the terrorist team does not plant it or defusing it once it is activated. Hostage Scenario: the Counter-Terrorists must rescue hostages from the Terrorists, and bring them to an extraction point; the Terrorists must prevent the hostages from escaping. If a Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist attempts to kill hostage, they will suffer a heavy cash penalty. An update later changed how Counter-Terrorists rescue hostages: instead of leading them around, players must carry one hostage at a time to the extraction point. Arms Race: a deathmatch-based mode where each player is rewarded for each kill with a new weapon, with the first player to get a kill with every weapon in a predetermined set winning the game. Demolition: a round-based mode that removes weapon and equipment purchasing, instead rewarding players who manage at least one kill by giving the next weapon in a predetermined set of weapons. After a second kill with that weapon the players are also rewarded a grenade (of a random type) along with their new weapon for the next round. Deathmatch (added on November 12, 2012): a mode consisting of 10-minute matches.Players must gain the highest possible score by earning kills with different weapons or desired weapons. The number of points from a kill depend on the weapon. Players may also take advantage of bonus timers for different weapons, using them to score extra points. Like in Arms Race, players automatically respawn after getting killed, but also when they choose to respawn with bonus weapons. Global Offensive also offers two offline modes: Offline with Bots, which offers the same game modes with AI-controlled bots; and a Weapons Course for inexperienced and veteran players alike. Global Offensive supports matchmaking and leaderboards for all online game modes, provided by Steam.The provided online service offers the ability to filter by game modes, maps and a built-in Steam friend system. Valve also employs Valve Anti-Cheat, which can automatically remove and ban players from the Valve online network. To match players of similar skill levels for an enjoyable experience, the game uses a heavily modified version of Elo rating system.The PC version of Global Offensive also supports private dedicated servers that the player may connect to through the community server menu in-game. These servers may be heavily modified and can be completely different from the base game. Global Offensive began as a port of Counter-Strike: Source to Xbox Live Arcade by Hidden Path Entertainment. During the development Valve saw the opportunity to turn the port into a full game and expand on Counter-Strike 's gameplay. Global Offensive began development in March 2010 and was revealed to the public on August 12, 2011. The closed beta started on November 30, 2011, and was initially restricted to around ten thousand people who received a key at events Valve attended to showcase Global Offensive. After issues such as client and server stability were addressed the beta was opened up to progressively more and more people (approximately 100,000 beta keys were given out as of July 4, 2012), until the beta became open for anybody to join and play.Before the public beta Valve invited professional Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source players to play-test the game and give feedback. At E3 2012, Valve announced that Global Offensive would be released August 21, 2012 on all platforms, with an open beta starting roughly a month before that.It was never released on the PlayStation Network in Europe. The game originally launched with four game modes: Classic Casual and Competitive, Demolition, and Arms Race. At first, CS:GO started with six of the classic Defuse mission maps: Aztec, Dust, Dust II, Inferno, Nuke and Train (the map Vertigo was added in a later updateas well as Mirage, Overpass, Cobblestone, and more later). The Demolition maps included Bank, Lake, Safehouse, Shorttrain, St. Marc, Sugarcane. Hostage missions started with two mapsItaly and Officeand later added Assault and Militia. A few important changes to the original Hostage gameplay mechanics include: randomized hostage spawn points, the requirement of having to carry a hostage (instead of having them follow the player), and a rescue kit to shorten pickup time. Lastly, there are now three more modes: Arsenal: Arms Race, Arsenal: Demolition (which combines Defuse and Arms Race) and Deathmatch. Overall Rating 10/10
SchoolBoy Q;-;WHY YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME! PLEASE READ AND RATE! 1. CS:GO Is alot more simple than other FPS' such as call of duty or battlefield, CS:GO is very basic and easy to learn all the steps on becoming a very advanced player. Other games like Call of Duty offer things like attachments, Killstreaks, Prestiges, Levels, and Advanced player options which can be good for some players, but it takes quite a while to get use to all the controls and how everything works. But in Counter Strike You get the game and start playing right away not having to learn all the controls. 2. You can make money. Counter Strike and other games by valve such as TF2 and Dota 2 Offer an in game market place. In the market you can Buy and Sell Tools, Guns, Stickers, Crates, Keys and Many more things. The market allows you to convert in game items into real money which will be put onto your steam wallet as soon as some one purchases your item, Now games like Call of Duty don't allow you to make money, all you can do is play the game. 3. The game offers free Downloadable Content. CS:GO Gives everyplayer the latest update/DLC for free, Games like Battlefield, Call of Duty, And Borderlands 2 Make you buy the game which is very expensive and on top of that the DLC charges you about 15 Dollars and Up! 4. The Game is cheap. Counter strike is only $14.99 On steam and it goes on sale very frequently, Most FPS Games cost anywhere from 30-60 dollars such as the new call of duty games which all cost $60 on release. So obviously you will be saving alot of money. 5. The game is over all very fun. Now i can't argue this point because Call of Duty and other FPS games are also very great games but CS:GO is worth the money. So i suggest you go ahead and start playing, you will LOVE it!

ProTo;-;What amazes me about this game is the special ambience the player lives while playing the game consciously. It's not just a random FPS game that's about shooting the adversaries randomly, as it requires subliminal reactions and reflexes. The simplicity of the game makes the gamer focus more on the precision of his shots and actions than on the graphics (although the graphics are acceptable) and on the rest of the petty details. Blatantly, the game was thoughtfully developed by the brave developers, who are still working on the game till nowadays, and are still considering the complaints of players and working on improving the gameplay to satisfy everybody. In the other hand, there are many hackers that are still there ruining everybody's gameplay. I can't deny that Valve is doing its best trying to get rid of these ashamed creatures but however they're still getting away with it. This game is a great successful accomplishment to the developers of Valve, despite of the cheaters who're trying to ruin this success and are definitely failing to do so. *ProTo tips the hat* Overall: Fascinating game. EDIT: Yes, the cheaters and the annoying/uneducated kids are everywhere ruining the gameplay, but however it's no reason not to buy this game so yeah, f*ck that.
.kowly;-;Amazing and unique, there are so many other words to describe this FPS but they wont fit in this page. BUY IT. NOW!!
Kinguin Lilaelele <HyperX>;-;CS: GO is a game that caters to people that love skill based fps games! It is a very competitive game, though that should not deter people new to Counter Strike! There are plenty of casual modes like- Deathmatch, Demoliton, Arms Race and a Casual Competitive. If your in the market for a new FPS game to enjoy definately consider picking this game up! :)
niggles.;-;"The bomb has been planted", *beep* *beep* *beep*. The sound of an imminent defeat or triumphant victory. The Terrorist side take their positions around the bomb site, constructing a web of incipient crossfire to prevent the Counter-Terrorist side from re-entering the site and defusing the square of C-4 ticking away. Dark spots pop into the sky as Smoke Grenades and Flash-Bangs come cascading into the site in a surgically accurate carpet bomb of smoke and light. The retake has begun. The scope of the infamous AWP ticks, the inbound CT player consumes the scope. The CT drops, only for the AWP player to be blinded by a split-second pop flash and dropped with a single bullet, pixel perfect headshot. *beep* *beep* *beep* The timer runs down, as does the chance that the Counter-Terrorists can save the round. After playing two "eco" rounds, the Counter-Terrorists could afford an AWP of their own, and it's used to take down another T player holding the site. It's 2 v 2 and time is becoming scarce. Crosshairs moved with the muscle memory of 1000 bombsite pushes. Two tense players rotate around the site, scanning the tops of their surroundings for an enemy. Target spotted. A careful manipulation of rifle recoil results in a single CT standing. The bomb nears it's expiration, and the remaining player dives to it, frantically praying that the defuse timer is faster than the fiery explosion. *beep* *click* "The bomb has been defused, Counter-Terrorists win." The round was won, the scoreline is even and the next round is about to begin. The round to win the game. CT's stack B, 10 seconds into the round, gets 5 man p90 aced by a 30 hour smurf. 10/10, is balanced and fair for all skill levels.

knji *Buying keys PayPal/Qiwi;-;It may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps (Assault, anyone?), and little features of past games, but Global Offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking Counter-Strike for whoever wants it. Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.
MeGuMen;-;Cool Game, Enjoying it !
Vacation Stargazer;-;Make back what you paid for the game by selling crates 10/10
Shrike;-;Best competitive FPS out there right now in my opinion. Most publishers have forsaken the "serious" gamer and those oriented towards professional gaming. Counter Strike: Global Offensive, on the other hand is geared to just those people. No modern FPS today relies so heavily on teamwork, communication and cooperation.
FriggeK [M];-;After over one thousand hours spent this is my review of Counter Strike Global Offensive. First of is... Gameplay! I think the gameplay of CS:GO is so close to perfect that it becomes beyond addicting! Its almost always a challange in almost anything! From Competitive matchmakings to Jailbreak Servers, from Arms Race to Surfing! There is endless creativity out in the community and it keeps getting better with the support of the developers. Is it different from Counter Strike: Source? To be completely honest... Yes. Its not Counter Strike 2, But its something in between! And this is not a bad thing! In fact... Its great! It still has some remaining feel of CS:S but with new looks, maps, gamemodes, skins and UI... The list keeps going. Why should I listen to you? This is my opinion, not yours! All this is just a little push in the right direction for a new player who does not know Counter Strike. The final score! I'll give this game 9/10 for the reason of amazing communities, massive e-sport events, developer support, design, performance and in general its one of those FPS's you need to really grind to get really skilled at. And when you have developed that skill... You will have a new challange waiting around the corner. //Fridge [CS:GO Competitive Player]

TheHurtmaster;-;The newer Counter-Strike actually got me again to love Counter-Strike. It's new great graphics, workshop support, weapon skins, a lot of new gamemodes, player rating system and the watch tab made Counter-Strike a whole better game. If you are a fan of shooters this one is for you.
Yanni;-;anyone who thinks this is a good game should die irl prob......
AyCe;-;This is a great game to play together with friends. Matchmaking is not the best, but sometimes you get to play against equally-skilled opponents, resulting in great and intense matches. However, you're not forced to use matchmaking, an old Source-server-browser is of course still available. Music is just perfect. It looks good and the weapons feel alright. Recommended!

FriggeK [M];-;After over one thousand hours spent this is my review of Counter Strike Global Offensive. First of is... Gameplay! I think the gameplay of CS:GO is so close to perfect that it becomes beyond addicting! Its almost always a challange in almost anything! From Competitive matchmakings to Jailbreak Servers, from Arms Race to Surfing! There is endless creativity out in the community and it keeps getting better with the support of the developers. Is it different from Counter Strike: Source? To be completely honest... Yes. Its not Counter Strike 2, But its something in between! And this is not a bad thing! In fact... Its great! It still has some remaining feel of CS:S but with new looks, maps, gamemodes, skins and UI... The list keeps going. Why should I listen to you? This is my opinion, not yours! All this is just a little push in the right direction for a new player who does not know Counter Strike. The final score! I'll give this game 9/10 for the reason of amazing communities, massive e-sport events, developer support, design, performance and in general its one of those FPS's you need to really grind to get really skilled at. And when you have developed that skill... You will have a new challange waiting around the corner. //Fridge [CS:GO Competitive Player]
ZAMANH;-;Best game competitive
irecon;-;Have you ever felt excited and frustrated at the same time or laughed and then felt like punching the closest wall to you? Well if not this is the game for you! Counter Strike Global Offensive has a continuously growing player base and incredible content that updates monthly. It is similar to the other cs games so I wont dive into all that but in short its a must if you like a well balanced competitive shooter.
TheStrangeMentlegen;-;The ranking system is complete trash, but the game is still fun.
< blank >;-;I totally recommend Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I've been playing Counter Strike and Counter Strike: Source for almost a decade and I can say this is the best competitive First-Person Shooter game ever. Counter Strike is the past, the present and the future of competitive FPS gaming.

Shrike;-;Best competitive FPS out there right now in my opinion. Most publishers have forsaken the "serious" gamer and those oriented towards professional gaming. Counter Strike: Global Offensive, on the other hand is geared to just those people. No modern FPS today relies so heavily on teamwork, communication and cooperation.

BlueSmasher;-;Basically its Counter-Strike. If you dont know what Counter-Strike is and know Battlefield you are safe but if you only know Call of Duty you are not safe. Ok lets get into my personal review about this game: Basically its still Counter-Strike with added features that makes the game more fun to play with. They added skins which you can make money off it or to show to your friends. The one thing I like about CS:GO is their matchmaking system.It groups you into your respective skill group to play against the same ranked people you are in. Beware of Smurfers tho there are alot lately but I find it fun battling smurfers since I can have a little view or insight about how high rankers play. OK about the skins, its not call of duty but its optional. But hey you can make money off it since you can get case drops, skin drops, etc. For the game itself, its still counter-strike. Thats all I can say basically, its still CS with added features and such to make the game more enjoyable than the previous ones. If you get hooked up with the skins you will last a few hundreds of hours, yes, hundreds of hours since I already done this on my first account and I really enjoy doing what I like to do with skins. There may be hackers and such in matchmaking or any other gamemode but all I do is just basically report them and just ignore them throughout the match even if its 100% lose for us. Anyways for me this is the best version of Counter-Strike I ever played since 1.6 which is I played it on another computer :p. Pick this up for 15 bucks or 419 Philippine pesos or whatever price your currency puts it to since its an awesome, enjoyable competitive game and it lasts AGES. Heck 1.6 even has a few hundreds - thousands of players playing it and about this around more than that. Pick it up its a nice First Person Shooter and I will recommend this to ANY kind of person, either casual players or competitive players. I would rate it around 9 - 9.5/10
Vincentor;-;It's a decent game, a basic shooter with basic mechanics. Even though the technology and graphical details of this game are horseshit for the generation it's released in, the freedom to create neverending, unique and creative custom content is what makes this, and all other Valve games, the best community experience you'll ever have in games. Even though Valve promised lots of features, some of these were planned and even revealed, yet not added to the final revision. In comparision to the previous, almost-a-decade-old release under the bland name of "Counter-Strike: Source", this game does have loads of improvements which were mandatory in the past. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive kicks Counter-Strike: Source down in a bottomless pit of shame. Your experience will differ from server to server. Avoid national servers at all costs and stick with playing on the same server you enjoyed playing on in the past. Every game community has its down sides, and this one definately has a problem with accepting new players. Expect to be heavily insulted and to get kicked/banned from servers for not being a skilled player.

StingerRPG;-;Now,why the  would you read the reviews when you already know that this game is going to be epic from the trailers? This game,is another successful money snatcher from our Savior Gaben.Prepare for your wallets getting robbed while you enjoy those awesome skins and Stattraks. Now,to start this off: Pros: Stright upgrade from CSS,no doubt,more detailed maps and other things, and the graphics are better. The items you drop,is all marketable.aka more money income,to put it in one way. More Weapon Choices The Game has an option to let you play competitive or causal. Knifes.Just beautiful. Cons: Cancerous community. "Its more challenging than CoD."-Anonymous "Its the gem packed with Quickscoping,and real Skill."-StingerRPG Its worth the 15 bucks,trust me.

Duster!;-;If you have a lag stutter for ten seconds, the game dc's you and you get 0 dollars for a round or two, since ten seconds of lag can disable steam for three minutes. The bot AI will buy a glass cannon awp and then run into the enemy no matter how many or even if one person says to hold position. You can't surrender until your leaver gets the 5 minute pass and sometimes your autistic allies will try to make the game continue so that you lose rounds and derank more. It takes around 15 seconds after death to actuall be able to take control of the bot, and to top it all off the game has one of the most infamously bad hit registrations of any modern competetive fps. http://i.imgur.com/PGVKZqF.jpg Taken at cl_interp 0 They made the netcode in defualt matchmaking as absolutly terrible as it could possibly be. There are obscure indies that do netcode better than this game. If you don't plan to just play esea/cevo then avoid this shitheap.

Jove_Gaming;-;Dear, Guy Who Just Quit League of Legend/ Dota Ok i get it you hated being stuck in your elo because your teammates constantly trolled you or threw your promo games and you wanted something new to play with a better community. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you all those same trolls play this game as well and as an added Gaben in your face this game has Hackers out the . All that aside Counter Strike has been one of the greatest FPS consistently throughout our lifetimes and we cant blame them for humanity, we can call them greedy as the skin system in this game was left to the peoples to decide and some conspiracy theories later we end up with digital skins that are worth more than some peoples cars, and you know Gaben is taking that 10% of all market transactions. But if you can avoid the hackers and mute the trolls it is possible to solo carry yourself out of Silver (This games version of Bronze) and make it to Nova where you should find simi skilled players that can communicate with you to a moderate degree about Dust II, BEFRIEND these noble gentleman as they are crucial to making it out of Nova! After that its all Hackers, GE Smurfs, Semi Pros and Streamers i suggest looking into alternative matchmaking prospects to hon your skills such as ESEA, CEVO or FaceiT. Good luck my friend i hope to see you on the sands of Dust soon may Gaben be with you always! Jove_Gaming

Cpt. Assist.;-;You will hate this game and never want to play it for the following reasons: -Competitive matches usually place you in games with higher ranked players disguised as lower ranks (sadly they'll be on the opposite team). -The amount of hackers (and absence of Valve doing anything about this) will annoy you on a spiritual level. -The match-ups for Competitive are absolute poop, you'll usually be placed against a team who are higher ranked. -You will be put with bad players who never know what they're doing, and even with A & B spray painted everywhere to show where the sites are, they'll all be blind to these and go to the opposite site to where bomb is planted. -You will lose all of your hair, mainly because you're pulling it out with anger. -You will be screamed at constantly by your teammates (usually children) even though you're at the top of the leaderboard with best KDR, most MVPs, and best score you will be screeched at, enjoy. -Not to mention, if you do end up playing well you'll be screamed at by the other team for being a "hacker" even though they're usually the worst player on their team. -Oh and then you think, 'cool I've won a case, after losing 16-0 in a Competitive match against smurfs and hackers' but then Valve screws you over again by giving you a damn awful UMP skin which you've uncased 12 times in the past week. Would I recommend this game? Yes! Do I want to kill all of my teammates and myself? Yes! Do I still play this game? YES! So if you have anger problems and need somewhere to go to take out your frustration, please buy this game and join Competitive since we need more screeching children to really make this game complete.

RIP old PC;-;Have to say this, csgo is a great game (a lot better than cod and bf) I used to play a lot of team deadmatch and arms race, since then I tried playing competitive. How I describe it: Rage simulator since 2012 Really, read this: If you are someone who enjoys life and never tryhard on games. NEVER PLAY COMP JUST NEVER Cuz the effect will eventually be you getting kicked by so called 'pro's' or you will get headshotted a lot and called out for noob and stuff so screw comp (I may sound like a noob right now and its true i'm noob and I don't give a F) note; I'm not trying to offend all those cs players who play in pro leagues and stuff and the ones who are good at it...

Hi im pho;-;One day I bought this because it was on sale for about $2.50. I didn't think much of it but then I started playing. I couldn't believe how addicting it was. I started losing sleep and skipping meals. It started to show on my physical health. My family started bugging me about it and even considered putting me into a rehabilitation center. Let's just say they won't be bugging me anymore. But now I dont have the funds to maintain an internet connection. I've sold everything I have just to play. I can't even go to starbucks and use their wifi because I sold my clothes and apparently they dont accept nudity. So basically I'm writing this review from my phone on top of a bridge. My life isn't worth it without this game. Yet it seems to have ruined my life. Goodbye world. gr8/8

Desolutional;-;This may seem like an old, outdated FPS in comparasion to the CoD and Battlefield series, but DON'T BE FOOLED! The element of competitive fun and rapid button tapping is alive and kickin'. Gameplay is fast, and unrealistic at times, but always fun. In addition to the standard modes and maps, the CS community really shines with its custom gameplay modes (e.g. Zombie Mode, Death Runs) and custom maps. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!
Marcusini;-;noob...reported...wallhack...kicked from the server
Axiee The 10fps Gamer;-;Loving the ban times on Competitive.. anyway. This game is amazingly amazing if you aren't up against hackers, russians communists and/or smurfs as that completely kills the fun in the Ranking System and CS:GO itself. This game also features a few gamemodes and many of the old maps from CS/ CS:S! I recommend you open up your wallet or purse , leave a few quid on Gabe's counter and swipe this from the Store if you have a good rig, or else.. it'll just be plain laggy and framy and you'll have no one to blame but yourself for refusing to get off your butt and upgrading your PC. .3. And last but not least, If you ARE REALLY FEELING IT! feel like raging and having fun (with Friends, or no Friends you loner ), then THIS is for you. >:D

[TiCr] JAMEStheGREAT3;-;Whether it be the graphics, guns, or the strategy, CS:GO drags the player in to play more and more. I would buy this game even if it was $30, yes it is that good. CS:GO has one of the best selections of game modes and game maps, so you are never bored. Even better, you can play the same map over and over and still like it. CS:GO also has a wide selection of weapons to choose from, and the weapon buying system is ingenious. The recent addition of weapon skins adds just that kick you need when playing. All you want to do is just unbox one. more. crate. for that chance to get a knife worth over $400. Long story short, GET THIS GAME!!! Stay classy, gamers! -JAMEStheGREAT3

RH;-;Counter Strike might be ur old fashioned fps game from ur childhood but this game has evolved and grow and we too have grow beside it. It was once a worldwie famous tactical fps game and I can easily say that fact has never changed. CS GO's ranking system and its Competitive mode has been a wonderful experience to play with ur friends for skills alone wont help u win the game but tactics and teamwork is the golden apple that is needed to win the match.
[ rao ]  "KQLY";-;Great game, 9 out of 10. CS:GO Is a hard game and takes a lot of time to learn, everyone is equal with the same guns and you can't... unlock new guns like in CoD (Call Of Duty) or so I have heard! Once you learn how to play properly like control ur recoil with every gun and things like that, you might find it hard to stop playing the game and not get addicted :D. I think it's a great game because it has great maps and Dust II is my favourite by far, however the maps aren't exactly balanced I would say. The game is quite funny at times and there is proof in some of my screenshots :D. The only reason why I don't give it 10/10 is because it's not exactly balanced with the maps. The maps have like different camp areas for each team and some areas are better and things like that, bomb spots, hiding spots, etc. But, apart from that, this game has made me play 1500 hours already and I think I've only been playing for a year! You could call me an addict but, once you've played this game, you won't blame me ;).

Arctic_SpaceKiwi;-;Campaign is too short, cannot reccommend
Privy;-;ing Tec-9  through smoke, fix the ing  I'm done.
undoctrl;-;This version of Counter-Strike aims to unify the Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source fans into a new iteration of the classic First Person Shooter. The casual mode is, while fun most of the time, a bit lacking in meaning to any halfway serious gamer. The competitive (classic ranked matchmaking) mode is extremely competitive, with most players simply looking to rank up at any cost, or simply not rank down at worst. Hackers and smurfers run fairly rampant in competitive, and can be a large deterrent to serous legit players. The game is updated fairly often, with new operation map packs available perhaps twice a year, carrying with them the added excitement of new skins for weapons in the game. Overall the game is a blast, whether you just enjoy FPS's to shoot things, or create an elite team capable of conquering the world.

Sheriff Stilinski;-;I definitely reccommend this game. It is by far one of the most fun fps's I have come upon. Gameplay is very simple, there are different types of gamemodes with different objectives. Additionally, the variety of maps also makes the game more unique, simply because of the different secret and strategical locations there are. You won't be meeting any cod fanboys in this game because it is simply class, however a recent change made a few guns have scopes similar to COD gun scopes. Guns and all equipment is very well balanced allowing for a fair environment. Counter-Strike Global Offensive simply brings a sense of real fps. No healing, no medics just guns and people trying to shoot other people.

With our match making system you will feel like  and never get to ten wins unless you have 30 loses! And your team mates will remind you it is your fault! Who the  am I kidding though right? No one is going to read this and think i tried my hardest. I have 57 hours in the game and haven't even reached ten wins competetive yet because I am being paired against people who are all gold.

DimDiDima;-;This is an excellent first person shooter that takes time to get used to, it's not your average Call of Duty or Battlefield. You don't frag people for some random scope for your rifle or a suppressor, instead you are trying to master out the legendary weapons that have been in all CS titles. The AK-47, the M4 and the AWP. These are the quite important ones, and the way to go.

Aka'tesh;-;And yet another game that valve ruined with micro-transactions. Boxes, skins, this  shouldnt be for sale. When did we ever pay for mods? For any game out there, look at Skyrim: hundreds of thousands of mods were created for it, nobody is asking you to pay them money to use their mods or skins. This is disgusting money grabbing tactic that Valve, is getting fat off. The more money and time you spend, the more ADDICTED you become. Because now, that you have invested in to this game, you cant stop. As a psychology student I can tell you, this is a very, very ruthless and dirty trick to play on someone. And they are using it to collect money from millions of users...This is unspeakable.
Jet Jaguar`;-;This game has a cancer growing in it. And the cancer is called South Americans. You literally cannot play in US East servers without South Americans teleporting around with their 150+ ping. I love CS, I've loved CS since WON. But I simply cannot enjoy myself while playing this game for more than 15 minutes at a time because its plagued with South Americans. I never considered myself to be racist till I started playing against South Americans. I know their countries are 3rd world and poverish. But that doesn't give them an excuse to act like monkeys in my games.

Brozilla (path back to smfc);-;I have already vouched that this game is one of my favorite FPS's of all time (I am including 1.6 as part of this "bundle" called counter strike.) If you are interested (which you most probably aren't), my review is on my alt acc.
SH0CKRA;-;Best FPS ever! It's the newest version of Counter Strike (CS). New weapons, graphics, online modes, skins (Buyable) and lots of new achievements to get. Well, im addicted. Throw your COD disc in the trash can and buy this. You won't regret it.
BloodWing;-;imo, its starting to become better than TF2. Less spam, less f2ps, lol noobs and campers get ruled out more easily. It isn't all about who can unload your magazine the fastest nor spamming with melee. The trading is much more simpler, more far, and more desired(and isn't controlled as much by people who just want to make their bp worth more so it compensates for their lack of a girlfriend or for their small ). the physics are less whacky due to recoil and require much more precision than tf2. even tho there are only like 30 maps, its still fun. 11/10 flutterdoges would reccomend as well
Shive Turkey;-;Such a good game must buy 10/10 buy buy buy give money to steamvalve buy buy buy
hR | Snacks ] [ One Pop Drop ];-;10/10 would play 200 hours a month again.
Skitzzzo;-;This is a remarkable next step in the Counter-Strike franchise that has been volatile for over a decade. With well-rounded gameplay, near perfect balancing of the weapons, fun, innovative maps, and great graphics that compliment the gameplay, we have a beautiful and challenging first person shooter here. But what separates this from other big franchises like Call of Duty and Battlefield? Well, the almost infinite skill ceiling allows this game to stand out from the rest. While you can still dive into casual games, run around, and score a couple of kills, those who spend hours and hours practicing in competitive mode will have fine tuned their skills to only aiming for headshots and other skilled tactics. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive provides a simple but deep first person shooter experience that provides customization, refreshing content, and a whole lot to learn for an extremely fair price compared to FPS counterparts.

g^;-;I have always been a fan of games that have good graphics and I admit that 1.6 lovers hate it cuz of its gameplay but If you know how to shoot and work the strats you can be good at it. 9/10 :) Must try before you say something!
Dr.GG;-;Yeah yeah, new cs is awesome, super cool etc. But I ing hate that  competitive ban system. I was banned three times for one damn week because of theirs ing "file [GAME]\pak01_001.vpk does not match the server's file" After each 7days ban i was playing for 5-10 days and then they released their ing update. After each update i verified game files twice but it's doesn't help. It just says that your game contain all files, go and get your asspain after our  update. That's total . Man who invented that gay crap with comp.mode go  yourself.  you and your mom's house. You ing . I ing hate you. Why I must  my  after each update to not being kicked because of some kind of . I don't give a flying  about what other s will think about this. This text just make my pain in my  less strong. Thanks.  you cs developers.

Bob2Million;-;Over time this game pays for itself. I literaly found a item, then sold it for $50 :P Would/Can buy again 11/10
Skittles;-;Overall a great game, it has a good competitive game mode that you can spend hours on on the various maps they have available, and provides a detailed ranking system that is difficult. You can also take part in various other mini activities in the game such as betting, or case unboxing. Overall this is a must game and is extremely cheap and well worth the 15.One of the best games I've played in a long time.

Kevin The Cucumber;-;My favorite game. Reasons: chickens,llama cannon, addicing cons, ruined my summer
Alw;-;Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar , with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players . This is a demanding , skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was , but it's for a specific kind of player . If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to , look elsewhere . Otherwise , this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors .
SeaKyuSee;-;I have mix feelings of this game...so heres a Rice Krispy recipe: 1/4 cup butter 1 (10 oz., about 40) pkg. regular marshmallows or 3 cups miniature marshmallows 6 cups Kellogg's Rice Krispies cereal In a large saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Add the marshmallows and continue to stir until the marshmallows have completely melted. Remove from heat. Stir in the Kellogg's Rice Krispies cereal coating them well with the melted marshmallow mixture. Using a buttered or silicone spatula, press the mixture evenly into a 13 x 9 x 2 inch pan which has been buttered or sprayed with non-stick spray or lined with wax paper. Cut into squares when the mixture cools. Makes 24 squares.
N2;-;This game is probably the best game i've purchased on steam. I mainly play this game competetively, so if you dont like games that get harder and require practice to eventually be really good at, i would'nt think that you'd love this game. But I am not saying that this is a bad game by any means, i have tons of friends that never play competetive but still love the game. This game is also fun to play with friends on community servers to play common things like surf, mini games, or jailbreak. Even if you dont like the competetive aspect of the game you should still buy it and try it out considering that its only 15 dollars! Another thing that makes this game great is the economy; i've probably made about $25 dollars off the game so far, but also given back about $30 dollars from gun camo's, DLC, and cases, etc... If you have an extra $15 to spend i tottaly recommend this game, but you never know, you might just end up with about +500 hours in the game like me.

Mister Schnappus;-;Yes, i Aprove shooting
Sefiermax;-;I am one that generally does not enjoy the FPS style of games. There is just something about Counter Strike: Global Offensive that makes me not able to put it down. You feel like becoming a better person is the goal of the game each time: you get a "clutch" victory or even die in a bad 1v1. This is a skill based shooter! The game is not about getting a new scope for your weapon... Improvement of yourself as a person and understanding how things work. I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone I talk to. If you want to become a better person and learn about discipline, self-respect, and teamwork. You need to try this game!

xT;-;1.6 players it's time to move on.
MorphineBear;-;It's kind of hard to actually recommend this game since it's so similar to Counter-Strike: Source. It really looks like an updated version of source with "high definition" graphics and some extras. Of the new things included are offline with bots, which is a nice touch and can be used to farm achievements. The bot's AI are very nice and the difficulty scales well, easy will be easy, hard will be hard. Everything regarding multiplayer is almost completely the same with workshop support. Nothing is really added at all in that area, though it has the feeling like Call of Duty, where people buy the product because they know multiplayer will be fun. There is also an added menu for choosing which game style you want (Deathmatch, Planting the Bomb, Arms Race, Competitive, etc). Gameplay mechanics are very similar to Source. Literally, they are the same. Same old ladder climbing, same old running and walking, same everything. It's basically an HD remake of Counter-Strike: Source on the Source engine. One other bonus is the twitch.tv support. I assume it has to do with tournament streaming, etc because competitive mode is a rather large thing. If you've never played a Counter-Strike game, I definitely recommend it. If you have, buying is "border-line". Would you buy Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 if you heard it was similar to Call of Duty: Black Ops? You get many people who upgrade for the hell of it and the others who decide to stick to the older game as they feel like the sequel is a waste of money. CS:GO is definitely the case of that. Of course, keep in mind that this is a much newer game and has updated Steam connectivity. Very, very easy to connect to your friends or join a random game for a quick round. Playing with a microphone is highly advised. Not to be played with a controller. Valve does not rub out players for money for DLCs or anything that makes this game "pay-to-win." Anything received in game could even be sold for a profit (real-life, that is). Obligatory score: 9/10
wooz;-;Very great game and can be handled by even an under-budget pc on high settings, fun for all and the best part about the game is competitive play, you have ranks which improve as you improve, so you get ranked with the people from your skill level, and as your skill level improves, you improve your rank as well so you get higher ranked people as enemies and teammates. It's very cheap aswell and you can even make money with the game itself from the drops that you get after a game. It's not much but the game is very big and also has it's own community servers, has ongoing support from the creators and gets updated around every month with new skins for guns. There is no in game purchaseable content (except for the operation challenge coins) which give you an advantage over other people. Very fun game and I greatly recommend it!

LordCanti;-;If you're ready to get verbally abused, screamed, and yelled at then this is your game. Get ready for the excitement of being called "trash, nub, or scrub" all while getting gunned down mercilessly by smurfs and hackers! 5 stars!
cs_go_learner;-;Haven't played an CS games before and bought this because I can see a lot of my friends play this. The first time I played this game and I hooked myself into this game. Apart from little bit waiting time in matchmaking servers, I don't have any negatives for this game. Graphics is good, Maps are excellent, Control is easy and overall game is fun and enjoyable. It takes time to master the game but nevertheless it is a good game. I rate this game a 10/10. It is a must buy for all gamer for it's sheer variety of game types.
YarYarBinks;-;This game alone is a game that will be known forever. It's amazing maps, to it's amazing weapon skins. This game does it all. This game is byfar is the best first person shooter in my opinion. It is also my favorite first person shooter of all time. Valve, holy crap you did a great job with this game!

ToXi;-;This, is the ultimate fps-title. No questions asked. It's not even a thing of opinion, it's clear, that a battlefield-game, and a call of duty-game comes up every year delievering same thing every year. This is different. There are multiple reasons why cs:go is superior over ANY other fps game i've ever seen/heard/played: Price, it's dirt--cheap. Yes, no csgo2 coming up next year. Gameplay: This game is competetive all the way. None of that CoD "competetive", where there is a kid from Iran singing some one direction song in the lobby. Community: one of the most active communities out there! Map-makers, skin-makers. You name it. Content: In this game, there aren't any map dlc's. The only things close to dlc's, are the "operations" where you can pay a couple of bucks to support the community map-makers, and getting access to those maps in official valve servers. Yes, and the official matchmaking is the nail in the other games' coffing. It offers not only a great (but annoying :D) rank system, it brings out serious gaming for the meta. Only thing i curse in this game, is the tickrate. Any cs-player knows the  behind Valve's servers, the tickrate. (the rate that in the server updates in a second) Usual tickrate for official matches, is 128. Valve servers offer 64. WHAT THE HELL VALVE!? But still, it offers HUGELY enjoyable expirience. This game has become one of my alltime favorite's. Why? Because it's the ultimate competetive shooter with tactical gameplay, teamwork, need of gamesense, and a kickass skin system! That's why!

afr0jackk;-;Addictive!
RadicalTanuki;-;P250 | Franklin isn't worth $100 GG Valve. But in all seriousness though this is the premiere tactical e-sports fps game. Not much else can be said about it's complexity and craft.
DanteDDL[UA];-;Finally a worthy successor of the famous CS 1.6. In the best traditions of their ancestors, but with better graphics and features. It is also fascinating and more tactical.
Catfish;-;I was never a fan of the way CS:S played compared with 1.6, however CS:GO has really captured the original and taken it to another level. I enjoy the ability to get the old "competitive" feel with the new ranked competitive mode... I've connected with a number of old players/friends and gotten back into this. Definitely worth the purchase!
Phallic Mushroom;-;They say it only costs $14.99, but it will take alot more than just that from your wallet and your family.

z0ks_;-;When i bought this game in early 2013 i didnt think it would become into on eof the most biggest eSport games of 2014/2015. At first i wasnt that keen on the game, everything was unbalanced and it was so weird and bad compered to 1.6 and Source, then when Valve decided to put some efort into polishing this game it turned out to be one (if not the best) game that they made. Everyone on Steam needs to have this masterpiece of a game. 10/10

AWPerator Bang;-;Since I have a tie and have a masters in Keyboard warrioring (game design) this is a well ballenced and competitive game. From my over 600 hours of record at the game I have still not learned a single thing but I still keep on coming back. I am currently I SILVER 2 and LOVE THE PLAYERBASE, every game I either get kicked for teamm8s afking in my fire or walking into my nades. Atleast in CALL OF DUTY BLOPS 5423525425525435 there is no competitive enviorment because all they care about is $15 DLC for crap maps. This game is amazing Remember kids EZ skins EZ life You can guess if your teamm8s are good at the game just by looking at their names EG xXquickscopezXx is B4D while GlobalElieteMeister is probably a SILVER 1 and is going to wrek you Overall I stil am typing random crap anyways just got qued up for a league game so my verdict is 9.9/10 -Bryan Porter Diamond I ADC

Revan The Bleeding Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

Juicy;-;I stood on the bathroom counter, naked, with my back to the mirror, my hands spreading my  cheeks so far open my  actually felt strained. My legs held a wide stance, as I peered between them with my head between my knees, staring in awe at the upside-down reflection of my beautiful -winker. It was red, wrinkled, and seemingly limitless in depth. A few stray dingleberries were clinging to my long anal-pubes, a result of inadequate wiping. I loosened the grip of my right  cheek, freeing one hand, then using it to circle the rim of my  with my index finger in a somewhat tickling fashion. My  flexed from the sudden and titillative sensation, involuntary retracting in an almost winking gesture. I giggled, then farted. Expecting to see some kind of cartoon-like green fumes or brown bubble, but instead just watching my little pucker momentarily expand then reseal, returning to it's natural form. "You're amazing," I whispered. My wife sat on the nearby toilet, sobbing with her head in her hands. The recent infatuation with my own sphincter was putting a strain on our relationship, one that admittedly wasn't going to be quickly remedied by any form therapy. This was pure love, not just some cheap form of fleeting lust or passing human desire. This was a burning, deep, enchanting devotion from the soul. My  was the most beautiful thing I've ever encountered. My wife realized this, and couldn't cope with her recent feelings of worthlessness. Anything we once had was gone - my divine sphincter taking its place. "I remember when you used to talk me like that," she sobbed. "Look at me like that." I slowly inserted my index finger inside of my gorgeous turd canal, moaning as my  began to stiffen,  residue staining my penetrating digit. My breathing intensified, as my body clenched with ic delight - a perversion so divine. "How can you flaunt your mistress in front of me like this, gratify yourself like this? How?" she cried desperately. Her voice cracked as her fading beauty-now meaningless to me-seemed to die a little more. She meant nothing to me. My bewitching brown oval consuming my soul with a desire like no other. Lusting for just one kiss with my poop-chute, I pulled my finger from my , tasting it with sensual delight. The sour, pungent taste of fecal matter brought my  to a complete and raging hard-on - pulsating with every excited heartbeat. Smacking my lips, I savored the grotesque turd juice, as if sampling a fine wine. The pre- now dripping with erotic anticipation from my pounding ramrod. "Hold my -cheeks open while I jack off," I ordered my wife. "I want to see my  when I ." "No! I won't do it!" she screamed in complete distress, the hurt in her voice matching the desperate tears streaming down her face. "This isn't right! It's not ing right! I'm your wife!" Ignoring her, I reinserted my index finger up my pooper, while furiously masturbating with my other hand. Angels sang as I began building toward , moans of enchanting ecstasy echoing off the bathroom walls. My eyes crossed as I screamed with absolute pleasure, I was close, so ing close. "Stop it! Stop it!" my wife pleaded. My strokes became more defined, faster, harder. I cried out in desperation. Almost there... "Jesus! ing stop it! This is our home! Ours!" she cried. "How can you...?" A tremendous warmth filled me, as my  spit white gravy in immense, systematic spurts. I continued fingering my , stimulating my prostrate, enhancing the sexual euphoria, as my steaming  shot thick man juice across the bathroom, clinging in long, mucilaginous strands to the wall. My vision blurred, feeling the full force of the powerful quake. The light faded as I fell into world of unconsciousness, basking in the comfort of my newfound love, and the endless pleasure of an absolute anal infatuation.

dava;-;I only play little bit, but it was fun.
Okamimi;-;Highly competitive! While the feeling of losing after a painful 45 minute competitive match, the feeling of a close win makes you so happy that your uterus will hurt... Personally I find myself to be the most inconsistent player in the world, and consistency is a key thing required for this game, as you need to win games in a row in order to rank up. I can't handle this and therefore my punishment is keeping my forever in the silver-zone. There are quite a number of hackers you may meet eventually though...

G4MER;-;nice game and best ever
HuseinsBTK;-;Basically the same shooting game you have played 1000 times, but if you are obsessed with being the best or smtg, then ranked is for you. Most common languages you will meet is english and russian. Best of it, is that if you are pist off by noobs, you don`t have to worry about it here. Once you gain high rank you will play only with similar ranks. You can find interesting events and communities and hey - mby even friends. And if you have friends, you can play ranked together. The first thing I recommend - NEVER EVER shoot teammates in first second and NEVER EVER leave ranked. Penalty is ridiculously high. And if you think that 11EUR is too much, you can always wait for discounts like 50% & 75% off which is nice.

xtremeevo27 (TRADING);-;this game has tooken my money,my life,my family and my education. The only maths i know how to do know is the value of each gun and how to rip off someone for there camos 10/10

J_FF;-;I definetley recommend this game. Such a fun, competitive game. Love the competitiveness and the casual play options. Good game for the heavy pro gamers and the light, casual gamers. Overall, an awesome game.
DotaMasterMind | Kharidari shod!;-;Perfect
Casual Pancake;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is what a FPS should be. This has to be the best skill-based FPS on the market. The guns feel powerful and rewarding, and the addition of camos is great. The only problem with the game is the difficulty. The game is played competively, and a good amount of the players on it have been playing Counter-Strike since the beginning are godlike. So the game has a bit of a learing curve in the respect that it takes practice to be able to compete against some of the other players. But once you are to that point, this game is extremely rewarding. Getting a kill in this game is so much more satisfying than any other FPS I've played, mainly because getting kills aren't easy. All in all, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a must have for any FPS fan due to the rewarding gunplay, great map design, and large community as soon as you overcome the learning curve.
shadow211121;-;TOO COOL To BE TRUE. I have no idea why the players of 1.6 and source hate it. It is an amazing game. It has great matchmaking so noobs dont play with a pro. Try it.
Levi;-;Don't do it. Just don't. Go play something else. Gamwmana akia..
renny_s;-;An incredibly fun game when you arent being molested in every hole by cheaters!
arnold bageltits;-;its like the matrix the enemy can use slow motion to dodge all your bullets, but you can't matchmaking/10
Riot King11;-;Amazing FPS, such an upgrade to the others in the CS series! Costs a little bit but the fun is endless!

#YOLO #SOO Kawaiii!!!;-;like a bossss game!!!! Should buy it, but need to pay a lot for awesome skins Still worth my $14.99
ZA | Darkcloud;-;The best FPS out there fun, full of action. BOOM HeadsShot!!!
inwt;-;Awesome game, amazing graphic, perfect gameplay...
donq_;-;One of my favorites.
Gogata;-;This is the best 1st person shooter game.
stere0flash;-;The best CS game !
The Phantom Barber;-;One of the funnest/most addicting multiplayer games out there today. This is easily one of the best games I have ever played. With that being said, it does have its flaws. For starters the community is one of the worst in the video game industry. Constant arguments, insults, sarcastic, and obnoxious people littered all over CS:GO. Competitive is taken very seriously and you better hope you have a good team, or else it wont be a fun experience. Be prepared to get randomly kicked in games sometimes, and insulted for no reason. Besides some technical flaws, and the community, once again, CS:GO is one of the funnest games on the market to date. (10/10) -CM
Xyno (Yann);-;The game where you kill chickens instead of killing your enemies. Chicken/10
~JSU76~;-;Its official I am hooked. Burned over 5 hours straight playing this game after purchase. I was a little hesitant in getting it and asked a few Steam friends about it and they said it was very good. I like the new graphical updates to source, it looks great and runs smooth. Sound and music are well done also. I like the stat and achievement tracking feature it has. I also like the fact that it has bot support for when I do not feel like dealing with whiny 10 year old punk kids. I enjoyed checking the new maps and gameplay options out, they are a lot of fun & challenging. CS:GO is a great addition to the franchise. I highly recommend picking this up for the low price tag it is being offered for. I look forward to all the new content that Valve has in store for CS:GO as well. That is the great thing about CS is its mod support and added content that unlike Battlefield and COD you seem to have to pay for or its no as user friendly for mods. Recommended
Howly *music*;-;best fps game of all time
A pissed off sponge;-;Liked CSS? You will love this one.
Finn_;-;Very good game. Takes some time to get good at, but the gunplay is great and you can have some great fun.

.iNSANITY;-;this gaem is grate
Cookie Monster;-;One of the best games of all time.
Ghost;-;Want a game that says  YOU CALL OF DUTY but still has that call fo duty feel with the mix of realism well guess what we I reccomend you!!! This game is a fps with great graphics a good community besides the accasional troll and the lil kid trolls even though the kids can be funny sometimes everyone here is really nice and the game is a great en game i like this game with ALL MY KILLING INSTENCTS IN MY BODY i give this game a 8/10 because of the fact that this game can be glitchy during new updates but they are relitivly easy to fix and then the other point is for the trolls you get in this game th game itself is amaing but you do get the trolls like any other game but besides that GET THE DAMN GAME!!!!!
shit player :3c (i'm dead);-;you shoot people 10/10 edit: music kits ruined it 0/10 edit: op vanguard 11/10
//Aceester\\;-;Get it, or you are a downy.
Bebardish | video juegos master;-;If you hate call of duty but like to shoot stuff, this is for you. it's team based mechanics work well and it's very fun to see your team accomplish your goals. This is the only First Person Shooter that executes a hostage rescue/bomb scenario extremly well. 11/10 would shoot more terrorists
Weeaboo Shit;-;This game is the definition of an action competitive shooter
Swim;-;If I had a choice to be playing CS GO or Doritos the offical game I would.
jackiedanniels;-;Totaly destroyed my social life, any chance of finishing school with good grades, my chance of having girlfriend and drained my wallet because of skins. 10/10

sG | ^.< [SO];-;Excellent game! Definitely recommend getting it, especially during sales. Big improvment from previous Counter Strikes. New competitive matchmaking system. 9.5/10 Would buy again
Shin Chan # I wanna Rank down !;-;VVVEEERRRYYYYY Awwweessommee Game Play with Friends And have Fun , Whenever you would die you will throw your Mouse :D
Gencho Peev;-;Outstanding Game ! Its not the amazing Graphics and gameplay, but it is voth for skilled players and players who want to have fun. Really big choise of Maps at Competitive Mode, just hilarious !!
Obi;-;I was in a furious masturbation session and right when i was about to ejaculate an add pooped up saying somthing about counter strike on steam back when i was a console peasent, but once i got a pc, my masterbation sessions went up a lot and i got garrys mod, everything was the color of my jeez, white and purple so i asked my doctor if i had contracted aids cuz maybe my right hand was infected or somthing, but he just said that i had to get cs source, so i got the whole thang and i started playing csgo, at first i did not like it, but after some time and masterbation sessions i started to play it more and its reely fun, its my top 2 on things to do everyday, 1 being masterbating to sophie dee, she the bae. soooo whats your story?
casool;-;the best modern fps ever
NexOn_;-;This game that will probably not charm every player out there. The gunplay is precise, effective and unforgiving. Rush into the enemy and you're K.I.A. Fail the objective in front of your supervisors and you will get shouted at. Unforgiving. That's what this game is. And then you get a kill. You check the right top corner, just to be sure. Yep, you got him. Ice cold. Feels good, doesn't it? And then it happens. Your team is dead. You clear the site. You defuse. Seconds fade away as your sweat slowly surrenders to gravity. You did it. YOU DID IT! Your team, the same people who called you thrash minutes earlier, commend you and virtually pat you on the back. You are the MVP. You are the hero of this round. That's what you get out of Counter Strike: Global Offensive. A gameplay formula that withstood it's fight against time. A diffucult challenge so rewarding, it will keep you coming for more and more. You will struggle, doubt and fail a lot. But your proggression will not remain unnoticed. Every frag you take, every knife you sink deep into your enemy's flesh will get you closer to a cold-blooded killing machine. You will play until you become a murderous husk screaming at your less experienced teammates for every little mistake they make. But hey, you will probably have a ton of fun until then!
[Y]tse'Jam;-;I like, but too many cheaters
Storm;-;The Best Game I have ever played. Nuff said
kamikazi4life;-;This strategic team-based first person shooter brings back the classic elements of an old-school arena shooter, but with a strategic, almost MOBA style map design. A very refreshing shooter in a genre dominated by arcade shooters that don't require any level of skill. Well crafted with beautiful maps and solid mechanics, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the only game that deserves to follow it's predecessors. If you buy this gem, beware: you WILL lose days of your life to this masterpiece of a multiplayer first person shooter. The only serious issue I had with this game is almost bad enough to turn me off of every valve game: the soldiers wear very bland shoes. How difficult would It be to give the soldiers some colourful shoes, with pointy tips of maybe springs in the heels. why would the developers not take into consideration the fact that players spends so much time looking at their feet, that perhaps, just maybe they would want to see something other than generic, boring, quite frankly lame shoes on the feet of their character. Step it up, Valve! This game is a solid 8/10, as it still lacks tactically more entertaining footwear
Sir Hamington;-;This game shows how much fun simplicity can be. Worth your 15 bucks for sure.
Fledermausmann;-;a lot of fun but the dark areas are quite dark and the light areas are quite light
mad$killz;-;Great Game! Buy it!
magicman546;-;Such guns. Much violence. Is good game
MrTechBoss;-;ive had this game for less than a week and i play it every day it has a nice multiplayer fps feel and the random trolling makes it even better having a great communitave team is key to winning though.

Mr. Roy Batty, Notary Public;-;the haters. A necessary update to an excellent tactical shooter.
{CoM} Hondor;-;Despite being one of the most unrealistic FPS ever made, it's still addictive (and hard). 9/10
El-ahrairah;-;Gets real intense. My heart can't take it. I died like six times while playing this, in real life. I'm a sixfold ghost now, real spooky. Anyways buy this game and play it because you can get red and black guns that are almost as cool as an oc of the same colour.
Poshtoffee;-;Never have I seen such brilliant teamwork when it comes to voting for Dust II.
KaptainFabulous;-;If You Never Want A Life Again Play This Game.
Zack;-;You shoot guns and bullets come out and sometimes the guns are really expensive like more than $30 and they look really nice. Sometimes you plant the bomb and it blows up but sometimes it doesn't blow up.
Anziii;-;This game is realy awesome I would recommend it to everyone that liked previous counter strike series my rate from 0-10 would be 8.9 :D
BakeACake;-;If i had a dollar for each time someone screamed at me in another language, i'd still have no money because i spent it on skins

Revan The Bleeding Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love...

Nobsi;-;Its not as bad as everyone claims it, imho its one of the best titles ive ever played
501idiot | 4qua [mic mustache];-;The entire Counter-Strike series has prided itself on strategic, competitive, and difficult gameplay. This game is the embodiment of that--highly reliant on teamwork, individual skill, and communication. Anyone who has wanted to play something that makes them yearn for improvement should purchase this game. The skill cap is immense, and there are always new things to learn. Valve (Volvo?) constantly releases patches and updates for the game, and frequently introduces new mechanics to keep the players on their toes. You won't be disappointed.
#OnLiiiNE ' DA$Hi ';-;Not quite as good as the good old Counter Strike Source, but still fun to play. Especially with some friends and skill. haha :)
ChickenNoodleTime;-;Very good game and very fun to play with friends. I'm not suprised this is one of the top played steam games

goddamn clickrs;-;This game is nothing like Team fortress 2 it takes skill hard-work. I recommend this game to those that love challenges and the bigger rewards at the end. If i were to not play or enjoy team fortress 2 or quit it i will definitely go this game. 8.5/10
Zee Jay;-;the game allows you to shoot chickens animal abuse, peta no approve 0/10
Phantom Actual;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is definitely a step in the right direction. All the people who played the older CS games will feel right at home with all the classic maps. However, everyone, no matter if it's a new player or veteran, will have to get used to new things like recoil patterns, movement, etc. So everyone has an equal chance of winning, depending on how much they've played and gotten use to the game, of course. CS:GO combines tactics with shooting skills so well that it is one of the best well-ballanced and competitive shooters out there.
Rajta;-;In my opinion, the best Counter-Strike, and a lot of fun!
[WLR] ReconWhale;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS GO) offers a simple, yet surprisingly fun approach to the FPS genre. Coming from Battlefield 3 (which I find fun as well), I found CS GO to be a refreshing alternative. While there isn't much variety in what weapon one is able to use compared to many other shooters, it does make it easier for the developers to ensure that gameplay is well balanced. The fact that it is so easy to find a match to jump into also helps to make CS GO a great game. My only criticism is that you are not able to disable bots in private matches (either that, or I can't find the option to do so), when I sometimes want to play 1 vs 1 with a friend. *EDIT: You can disable bots using the "bot_kick" command ingame* Overall, at the normal price of $14.99 USD, which is the price of some DLC's in many games, CS GO is a great value game that is worth every cent, let alone its price during the many sales Valve holds on steam.
RogueEffect;-;Simple to learn, difficult to master. Also, you can name your guns after anime characters and be a mega weeb :D ...what am i doing with my life? :/

kana;-;dis so gud shud totes buy is very cheap
~Ph4n[t]0m.w0w~#1lastday:D;-;Really Awesone Need it for sure played it
[NS] DarknessFalls;-;This game is a skill game unlike Call of duty and Battlefiled. You have no iron sights,so you have to know how to shot your weapons. If you have played Counter Strike-Source or other CS games,then this is the game for you. This game is not noob friendly. It requires you to work as a team. It is not a 'rush in and kill everyone yourself" game. You have to be careful as if it was a real life moment. How ever it is still a fun game. If you have the nerve you can still learn to play and be as good as everyone else. I hope this helps you. Becuase it would have helped me.
SFGunnerCraft;-;Counter-Strike Global Offensive is actually really good, not like 1.6 or source, but still fun, If you're going to buy this game I recommend you to play with bots for some days because you will find pro players everytime, and aiming is hard too. Oh yeah the only thing I think it sucks in this game is that no sprays. 7.5/10
Donkey;-;Great game! fun to play casually or play competetivly. completly recomend it
Dyseptor;-;I love this game its a great FPS shooter that actually requires skill to kill your opponents. I play it all the time and you have to work as a team to win! There are many different gamemodes even competitive which is really what I'm into!
The Savvy Sultan;-;I was a bit late to the Counter Strike franchise. I played most cods (MW2, WaW, and Black Ops 1) my life untill shown steam. I do own the other ones but this one, being the most current and with its own competetive online play is fantastic. Get in a group with 4 other friends and you'll have a blast yelling at each other for the entire game as someone will mess up and then everyone will start fighting. It's pretty great fun, especially since after MGE its very common to come across DDosers, wallers, triggerbots and aimbots. All in all, I do recomend this game, its pretty fun, and when you're not in a game with any of those people and you really get into it with some friends, its fantastic to play. Get in there and start Terrorizing or Counter Terrorizing!

So sit back and relax, and enjoy Call of Battlefield 3: Global Offensive. Protip: Only use the P90 and AK47 for max winnitude

Xtal_UNIX;-;The Classic thinking mans shooter, updated with contemporary graphics and online fixins', this is the only FPS for me. Period. It was preceded by Counter-Strike Source, probably one of the greatest competitive FPS games of all time, and only added great things to it with the new update. The Console version sucks, this is the one to play. Like someone before me said more eloquently, "You either die like a -s c r u b- , or live long enough to be called a hacker..."

TigerAW;-;Yes, Good game.
Pippin;-;REALLY good game you got here. How there's actually recoil and armour makes it so much more fun.... However, the summer sale of 2014 brought in so many wall and aim hackers. This ruins the game for everyone else playing it. So to put it in perspective "YA'LL JUST GOT HAXOORED
[SV] Yami EVOHYPE;-;Oh, Counter strike the fps that won't  you over with Prems, and is actually responsive. Im actually having more fun in this than the years of playing 1.5~6, Source, and the ranked compettitive matchmaking is neat whenever your in the mood for a serious game with communication. Community servers arnt as fun as CS:S though :c Also, you can milk steam money from the marketplace if you do it right.

Snort Cannon;-;Counter Strike GO is the return to the beloved Multiplayer shooter game Counter Strike but will you want to play the new one or stick to the Classics ? Of course everybody knows what Counter Strike is about. Essiantly Counter terrorist and terrorist fight and each of them have diffrent objectives. Honestly i love this game. The gameplay is way faster, tighter and way smoother than ever. The gunplay and awesome and you feel highly rewarded when youre on a killing spree. The game has a few modes and all of them are fun for theyre own reasons There are some problems that need fixing. The hit detection isnt always the best sometimes when you shoot the enemy square right in the face the shot doesnt connect. Overall the game is really fun and i enjoyed it alot and if you liked the previous Counter Strike games you need to own this title. I give Counter Strike Global Offensive a 8/10
ErWiN RoMMeL;-;gg one of the best games

SpecialSingBird;-;game is good, but still cs 1.6 is better for me...
White and Nerdy;-;A must buy!
m;-;This is a great past time. Guaranteed to get you all worked up.
Wendy Wickwire;-;Best counter-strike they've made yet - honestly. Imagine 1.6 gameplay, updated graphics, and all those little things that make life easier: stats, ranks, built-in spectating, collectible skins, sensible gameplay options, updated maps, streamlined hud - and especially matchmaking. I just love that you can get some friends together and be matched against 5 other people who want a competitive, but not too serious game. Awesome!
fraxyl;-;Certainly a game you have to stick at for a while to have any sort of fun with! More often than not I am frustrated by my inability to hit simple targets due to the way recoil works; for people like me it can be a brilliant game one moment and horrible the next. The player base in match making seems mostly comprised of people who's main aim in life is to tell you how much you suck at video games and generally treat you with contempt and unfriendliness, but if you play with friends and ignore the unpleasant mob, you can find a rewarding game, and even some genuinely friendly people who are there to help you improve or just have fun in bad situations. Before jumping into competitive, it's probably wise to familiarise yourself with the rules, as friendly fire and dodgy internet connections alike can result in temporary bans. The graphics are quite nice, some of the voice work is a bit weird to me, but often a source of hilarity.
BloodWing;-;imo, its starting to become better than TF2. Less spam, less f2ps, lol noobs and campers get ruled out more easily. It isn't all about who can unload your magazine the fastest nor spamming with melee. The trading is much more simpler, more far, and more desired(and isn't controlled as much by people who just want to make their bp worth more so it compensates for their lack of a girlfriend or for their small ). the physics are less whacky due to recoil and require much more precision than tf2. even tho there are only like 30 maps, its still fun. 11/10 flutterdoges would reccomend as well
Shive Turkey;-;Such a good game must buy 10/10 buy buy buy give money to steamvalve buy buy buy
hR | Snacks ] [ One Pop Drop ];-;10/10 would play 200 hours a month again.
Skitzzzo;-;This is a remarkable next step in the Counter-Strike franchise that has been volatile for over a decade. With well-rounded gameplay, near perfect balancing of the weapons, fun, innovative maps, and great graphics that compliment the gameplay, we have a beautiful and challenging first person shooter here. But what separates this from other big franchises like Call of Duty and Battlefield? Well, the almost infinite skill ceiling allows this game to stand out from the rest. While you can still dive into casual games, run around, and score a couple of kills, those who spend hours and hours practicing in competitive mode will have fine tuned their skills to only aiming for headshots and other skilled tactics. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive provides a simple but deep first person shooter experience that provides customization, refreshing content, and a whole lot to learn for an extremely fair price compared to FPS counterparts.
( );-;ING BUY THIS GOOD ING  . ING GOOD COMMUNITY. ING GOOD GUN SKINS. ING FUN TO PLAY. USING CAPS TO MAKE THIS MESSAGE LOOK IMPORTANT :D

g^;-;I have always been a fan of games that have good graphics and I admit that 1.6 lovers hate it cuz of its gameplay but If you know how to shoot and work the strats you can be good at it. 9/10 :) Must try before you say something!
Dr.GG;-;Yeah yeah, new cs is awesome, super cool etc. But I ing hate that  competitive ban system. I was banned three times for one damn week because of theirs ing "file [GAME]\pak01_001.vpk does not match the server's file" After each 7days ban i was playing for 5-10 days and then they released their ing update. After each update i verified game files twice but it's doesn't help. It just says that your game contain all files, go and get your asspain after our  update. That's total . Man who invented that gay crap with comp.mode go  yourself.  you and your mom's house. You ing . I ing hate you. Why I must  my  after each update to not being kicked because of some kind of . I don't give a flying  about what other s will think about this. This text just make my pain in my  less strong. Thanks.  you cs developers.

Fossilfern;-;GRAB MY SEMI! GET MY SEMI BEFORE THEY DO! QUICKLY GET MY SEMI! 100% recommeneded.
Enuck;-;Counter Strike Global Offensive is an excellent first person shooter in every way possible. The community is for the most very good and friendly. One of the best aspects of this game is the competetive mode where you and 4 other friends can play versus other players around the globe while you rank up and earn new camos for your weapons. Some elements of this are not so good like problems with lag and disconnecting depending of what part of the world you live in (probably will get fixed). I will recommend CSGO very much to the avid fps gamer and it is a must in your steam collection!
LTZ [-___-];-;Most recent iteration of one of the purest FPS games to ever hit the market. MM needs more restrictions to keep out cheaters, otherwise great.

.Gulo!?;-;Not great, but keeps my attention for an hour or so. If valve would spend less time making pretty weapon skins and stickers and more time improving the servers and the game mechanics it'd be very good, maybe. As it is, it's barely a 7/10.

cs_go_learner;-;Haven't played an CS games before and bought this because I can see a lot of my friends play this. The first time I played this game and I hooked myself into this game. Apart from little bit waiting time in matchmaking servers, I don't have any negatives for this game. Graphics is good, Maps are excellent, Control is easy and overall game is fun and enjoyable. It takes time to master the game but nevertheless it is a good game. I rate this game a 10/10. It is a must buy for all gamer for it's sheer variety of game types.
YarYarBinks;-;This game alone is a game that will be known forever. It's amazing maps, to it's amazing weapon skins. This game does it all. This game is byfar is the best first person shooter in my opinion. It is also my favorite first person shooter of all time. Valve, holy crap you did a great job with this game!
*|PEZ|* Gump12;-;Yeah its good. Spent lots of money on it.
Ian Gilliam;-;Just buy it.
mguniverse;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive raises the bar for tactical first person shooters. This game is finely tuned and balanced not only in gameplay but with map design as well, to create an even fight for both teams. This pushes players to not simply hope for lucky shots and instead think more strategically about their every move. The introduction of weapon skins gives people a cosmetic incentive to strive for, as there are different weapon skins to fit the individual style of every player. This combination of pristine gameplay and in-game economy makes this one of my favorite first person shooters to date and it will likely never be overshadowed by another.
Formido;-;Amazingly rich storytelling and character development. 10/10
SuB<3Geoff RIP;-;Very solid game i would buy this game
SkunkIE;-;I would recommend this game to any player still missing that great feeling from playing counter-strike. Some things I really enjoy about this game is that it's a IMPROVMENT over CS:S and does feel more like CS 1.6; All the original maps with a few minor changes to help make the maps better; new guns and improvments and custom weapons are a plus.
Genesis;-;Good For FPS lover because its mix everything and it very fun!!!
|) /-\ /\/ / 3 /_;-;Best skin simulator on the market. 10/10.
Buderp!;-;100% recommend! Fantastic game! Either play for fun with your friends on all of the variety of servers or test your skills in online competitive where you can get ranked to play with people within your skill level!
jump;-;Global makes sense, but I played this game and didn't get offended MisleadingTitle/10
Leci;-;Even Taylor Swift plays counter-strike...why arent you?
Rempahw0w;-;you either die a scrub or live long enough to get called a hacker
Of Course;-;What can I say? This game harbours an explicit way of first person shooters. Run, Aim and Shoot, but you ask yourself, is that really it? My answer and hundreds and thousands will agree with me here in saying, NO! This game is not explicit, this game is so complex that It breaks away from every shooter to date. This game is an anomaly. This game will treat you hours upon hours of enjoyable strategies, intense nail-biting games, immeasurable comebacks, case(key)purchasing, hacker allegations, skin buying and the most celebrated attribute to this game, Fun. Competitive gamemode is what I will be discussing in this paragraph.Counter Strike Global Offensive does what Call of Duty and many other shooters can't, team strategeies. While team strategies don't prove to be utmost prevalent in some Fps's, this game basks in that essence, it basks in that oasis of serenity. Team strategies is so important in this game, that If you have a 'bad' team, you will find yourself a little vexed because one guy cant smoke mid, or cant aim with an AK-47, but when you do find yourself that perfect mix of players, then will you really enjoy the essence of the game. Now the non-competitive gamemodes do add in a sort of haven for people just starting out. Arms race, the gamemode in which you start out with a gun and once you progress killing the opposing team, your guns will also progress. Once you reach the gold knife level, then you really have a challenge. Casual servers are perfect for practicing for competitive and gun aiming too. Now some cons in the competitive servers are that you will find some players are quite belligerent and abasing in the sense that they will troll you, teamkill you, annoy you and will critique the very way you play, but in my opinion, just have fun and try not to get those types of people inside your head. In conclusion, I strongly believe that this game is fantastic, it strays away from that different side of fps's and delivers fantastic gameplay and enjoyable hours. I reccomend this game to anyone that owns steam.
Mackeloff;-;Great Game, so many hours gone ;D
Korazian;-;It's a good fun game to play with large groups of people/friends, whatever. Even if the anti-cheat is , there are tons of smurfs, and you rage for the stupidest reasons. Only if it was a blanaced game. Overall it's MEH
Kryos;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a spectacular game with great immersive multiplayer experience and community. The developers actually listen to the community and fixes the problems of the game while adding new and fun content. There's tons of updates coming in, which makes it more and more enjoyable since it came out. Overall, this game is one of the best. 10/10

Br0TherOfW@r [ PT ];-;Cs go,the latest competitive valve fps.Worth it?,or just stick with the old ones.? That must the most asked question that everyone makes when facing with the choice of buying this game,well i hope this little review helps you decide. Cs:Go provides some new right choices and some bad ones. Being a competitive game this game excells at almost everything the right way, from the way weapons feel when you shoot them or the maps with new layouts reinvented.Althought from time to time ocasionally suffers from some Ramdomness fireshoots directions where the bullet ends up being away far from where you aim for no appearent reasons.But in rare cases.And with the new patchs upcoming it will probably be fixed. That moment in the decising moments can end up being felling just unfair where you feel you could have done it. The new matchmaking for ranked games work well but then again from time to time it fails horribly,where you find yourself teamming up with players with too much width range of skill gap betwen. where then again you find yourself in a more of a 5vs4 match then a fair match. But it isnt game breaking and doesnt ruin it by far.And on top of ranking lvl that gap quickly disappears. Being that world elite class. The new molotov cocktail granade provides a welcome new mechanic to the game. Being only fully used yet on highter ranks. Believe me it makes a quite difference. The graphics specially the shadows look amazing! The new source 2 engine feels more natural and vibrant then ever. For that in my opinion it deserves a 8.2 out of 10. Being itself not a fps innovator by far it furfills almost all of the cs 1.6 and cs:Source mistakes and errors. And on a good side. Of course some people might argue that 1.6 shooting is the real quake style where skill is the king of the game. that might diverge from person to person. Pros: +Graphics look amazing +mechanics feel more natural. +Hands and movements of Characters feel natural and human. +new map layouts +Competitive ladder +weapon skins unlocks addes quite a welcome variety Cons: -Still has to improve in hitboxes in some ocasions. -Server regions make some people have and average of 87\110 latency\ping in ranked matches... -has lower gamemodes then source and 1.6. -Not casual hasfun game has source or 1.6.

NurseBoB;-;One Of the most competetive fps games i've played,Its the best game i've played.
jaishe;-;If you like getting penetrated by valve then this game is for you!
ThoughT;-;Take that amazed feeling you had when you first saw CS:S for the first time while playing 1.06. Now get rid of that image because that doesn't apply here. Then take all the challenge of mastering weapon's "behaviours" from 1.6 and Source and get rid of that as well. Then take the broken husk that is left, force it to have a child with Call of Duty and you have Counter-Strike: Go play something else.
Bushmandan101_;-;Very good game for first person shooter. Good graftics and i play like 1 hour a day really great game.
00th_Underlord_Silence Dogood;-;Let me tell you about this ing game. This game is the bane of my existence. I swear that if I couldn't get money off of it through Community Market I would barely play this ing game. It's like... I swear it's like crack cocaine. I know it's just eating away at me, soul and body, but I cannot stop snorting it, it's just too good. When you're good, it's entertaining as . You have a good team, and you have fun. But it's like... It's like being obsessed with lemons, and then every day you come home with paper cuts all over your hand. Satisfying as , but it hurts so bad, and you can't really get a good night's sleep. All in all, the quality is good. Just frustrating as . 8/10 Silence Dogood THIS GAME IS PLAYED BY THE 00TH REGIMENT OF FOOT
Zeddy;-;This is the best Modern Shooter MMO on the market I've ever downloaded, and since its cheap its even better the only thing that annoys me are the microtranactions and some of the champions I want to buy are very overpriced and premium currency is way too expensive. 10/9 would buy
72 YEAR OLD RAPIST;-;Good game, fun to play
Tarfun;-;Very fun and engaging. The game takes a lot of skill, but that's what makes it fun to me.

pelivaniv;-;My opinion about this game can be just positive.I started playing Counter-Strike very long time ago and I always used to like it,but year by year it just became bad because of cheaters,scripts and that stuff,so my friend have gifted me Counter-Strike Global Offensive.In the beginning I thought it is bad game because I only had 20-30FPS and that is considered as unplayable frame rate but I will still playing fine.Now when I upgraded my PC this game seems to be awesome.Why is it awesome? -No much cheaters as in previous versions of CS. -Competitive mode. (I love it!) -New visual effects. -Some new guns. -New game modes. -Skins (No need to download 'em ,just collect) I think if you love Counter-Strike games you should buy this one and try it ,you won't regret it!
M5///;-;its the best game i have ever seen!!!! multiplayer,singleplayer,zombie,surf,minigames and much more!! this is the best game buy it you will not regret it!
Vangity;-;Either you die like a scrub or become a pro!, Really nice competitive game! Love this game.
KOSHER1g;-;Definitely a fun game and reminds me of good old 1.6. The only downside is the accuracy that people pull off while running backwards and fleeing is ridiculous. As well as, accuracy while jumping/falling... This should be 0 or .00001% . It seems to be around 50% accuracy. I wish they would have allowed for more spots to be spammable, but I guess they did create this towards a newer generation gamer who had no idea what 1.6 was like. All in all, I would recommend this game. It still is fun regardless of all the downsides. You can compete in competitive without mIRC (but when you get higher a lot of cheaters appear) and you can also play offline.
I Quit (-);-;Likes Everything...
InnocentCrook*;-;The friendly Russian players in Competetive Matchmaking will make you love this game and if you don't feel all snuggly, you can join Casual games where you can almost always find this one super-pro player who has 10x less playtime then you and somehow manages to get MVP every round. If you stop him however and kill him once, he might quit and give YOU a chance to become the Number 1 player.
hing;-;Another addition to the Counter Strike franchise. Been playing this game for 10 years plus, and still am finding new ways to do things each and every day. The community might be daunting and condescending at times but once you persevere through it and start working towards your end goal (whichever that might be), this game will bring HOURS of enjoyment.
910;-;Absolutely the best competitive FPS-game right now. Probably the best ever. 10/10 would play again.
BaKeD;-;Shot someone, enjoyed it. Would shoot again.
Velgor;-;Pretty impressed at the fact that Valve improved the graphics quite a lot and added a few more game modes like arms race etc. which does make it a bit COD-ish but still the simplicity of the Counter-Strike series was maintained. Although many new maps were added, we still notice the classic maps like Dust, Dust2, Aztec etc. It's not a very fast paced fps like COD or BF yet it's very enjoyable to play.
Costinteo;-;Competitive game with great community. Addicting, fun and sporty. Don't play after a sale though, lots of hackers are coming! There are more modes of gameplay. There's Arms Race (which is basically gun game for those who have played previous CS titles), Deathmatch, Classic Casual, Classic Competitive. Classic is in my opinion the best to spend time on and once you feel ready you can hop on a competitive with your friends. Don't worry if none are available, the matchmaking system will match you with adversaries and teammates with matching skill. Improve your skill and more important: Have Fun! Who knows, maybe you'll be the one to beat the Champions.
BEP;-;Latest in the Counter-Strike series , in theory same thing with fancy graphics , but some weapons changed the way they fire a bit , and not since long , but they added keys and crates into the game , with weapon skins (exactly what it sounds like , some paint finishes for your weapons).And also stat track weapons (stranges counting kills) , because yeah , it's a valve multiplayer game , and like team fortress 2 and dota 2 , it had to go this way :/ Some may complain about the way the weapons fire , how they liked the old look for the maps , incompetent players that are camping or idk what, but i tell you this : give this game a chance, get over 10 hours into it so you can get used to it, and you should begin to like it.However if you still do not like it, you are one of the few people that hate this game, because really , this is a game that is done pretty good. I say it is worth buying , even more if you buy it with the bundle or at a sale.
You just got raped.;-;Reasons to buy it: 1.Really good graphics. 2.Good design. 3.doesn't reqire that good GPU. 4.You can get steam wallet money from it. :)
Dopamine Deluxe [Silovique];-;Well.. how to start... I'm counterstrike boy starting from v 1.3. Big fan of CS all the way, it's my favourite game. When CS:GO showed up, i was really sceptic about that game, that's why i didn't bought it in 2012. CS:GO is one of the best FPS games you can find right now on the market. It's really balanced, from every pistol, shotgun, smg. You can kill with anything, weapon is not so much important, as in 1.6, where mostly you heard sounds of AK, Deagle, or AWP. As for me,even if i played more then 2000 hrs of CS 1.6 it was really complicated in my first matches, since textures and graphics changed a "bit". But it's not really that hard to get used to engine, graphics. I really like the competitive system, since i remember that pain in  called "mIRC" :D I'd recommend to buy the game at all costs.
Dr;-;It makes me horny!
i-V;-;Absoloutly godly. This game is a must-have. Why the hell are you reading this? GO BUY IT.
*****Troller56;-;i only played it for one day so far and im already in love with it i highly recommend it
AK-47 | SPETZNAZ;-;great improvement on the CS series... Only thing that is lacking is the wide arrayof maps that were always present in earlier versions like climbing maps, knife maps, scoutsknives, etc. I mean they do have servers that have them but 99% of the few that are are always empty. Also miss the servers with the add on mods like warcraft, low gravity, superhero etc. Granted those were not the primary game but they were nice to have to relax and mess around from time to time. Still the gameplay is great and the system is set up well. Just wish hitboxes and registry were a but more accurate.
Commissar Batley;-;operation gay

Valence Electron;-;Great game, 10/10
Foxx;-;Arguably the best Counter-Strike ever made. CSGO feels heavier, obviously more realistic, and is getting even more exciting than it's predecessors. From the new marketplace, created for us to utilize an awesome array of new weapon customization, new default maps from Vavle, to constant updates and fixes to better serve our preferences in-game easily has the game on the UP. I recommened any competitive FPS gamer to choose CSGO.
KITTYKAT;-;The game is very awesome!
Allahu VAC-BAR;-;When i was kid i started play with CS 1.3, then keep playing CS:S comes out. CS:S was not so good, so i stick with 1.6. Now, i really love CS:GO, its more fun than casual 5v5 scrim, its more social, its more realistic. More than game, its very competitive-like.So totally worth it. and of course we love custom skins, community maps + steam workshop is perfect 10/10 if you like FPS genre, must have it!
K0r0shi;-;Simply the best competitive FPS game.
CL #KrocTheVote;-;Despite what YouTube griefing videos implied to me, running around in Gun Game knifing people to demote them isn't nearly as easy as it looks, and that experience is all I wanted to get out of this game. This is just another case of me being  at a game and saying its bad because I never wanted to play it in the first place. Hahaha it's really good guys.
HaLiL *RaZeR;-;Counter Strike is a very nice game Each game has its advantages but also its disadvantages Advantages: You have many options to play Counter Strike. You can make competitions, can be played on normal and abnormal funny servers You get temporarily weapons or boxes that you can use in the game Disadvantages: Disadvantages include the Steam or Valve occasionally have problems with the servers ..... It has also cheaters who get nothing in life to the series and want to achieve something in the game Although it has more pros and cons but I think that's enough I recommend it to anyone but do not become addicted;) So have fun with it and if you have some question you can ask me
Ouch!;-;Simply the best FPS competitive game on the planet
J.G. Wentworth;-;It's gud.
TJ "The AK" Santos;-;Have you ever wanted to be a car, kid? Well now you still can't but you can cry yourself to sleep over the rounds you dropped, the friends you let down, and the relationships that you destroyed on CS:GO. Also, this game came in first at the Iowa state fair of 1945 for it's help in the Manhattan Project at Trinity. This game has a half-life to that similar to that of Carbon-14, and is now being used for carbon dating techniques based on your win/loss ratio on Vertigo. Whenever a bomb is thrown off of the side of the map, the Carbon-14 deposits plummet by the IQ of the closest spider to the Dalai Lama.
alpacas are in greg!!111!;-;Why won't CSGO blink over Call of Duty? CSGO holds a spatial expert. The distant approval consumes the orchestra. An orange pacifier garages the breakfast. Call of Duty remedies the history with the context.

Dustyy  <eSportsRDA.net>;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive; A game that incorporates the original classic, revolutionary, critically acclaimed, features that changed the FPS genre, helping mold what we have today. I'm not finished! Adding a new -needed- take, visually, gameplay wise and performance wise. Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a game created by Valve to bring it to the everyday player and the experienced or not so experienced competitive player! The game looks beautiful, it works like a charm and again, revitalizes the game without straying too far from its roots. If you're a COD player, a BF player, or a player who generally is adapted to playing with a scope will be confused for a couple games. The "weapons course" will help new players and old players alike get a definitely needed insight on how this game plays in comparison to others but again, it works and it really does help you out. The modes include offline and online for players who have different play styles and you won't miss out on any action or feel oppressed by it either. Valve has touched up the game and is continuously updating the game to keep it fresh. The game not only allows you to play preset game modes but allows you in tradition with source, to host, create, and join created maps by the community. What types of mode you're asking? Surf - Players use their keys to surf along linear or non-linear pipes that incorporate puzzles and reaction, speed and etc. Survival - Players play in a "hunger games" styled game mode that pits everyone against each other until the last man (or woman) is left standing. ETC ETC ETC This game has a lot of content for such little that it depends financially and hardware wise. However; there are some flaws that should be duly noted when/if purchasing. It being a Steam play game it may experience some issues with server lag, latency issues, ping issue which disrupt gameplay and well - time. That is the only major hiccup and rarely happens but when it does, it ruins the overall experience. My score? 4/5
Carrot Top;-;This  is bananas. B - A - N -A - N - A - S (This my )
Nathan;-;This game was the result of me failing University, I now take Class A drugs to ease my depression. Good game though
Nelu;-;Great game.
LovelyDosh;-;An amazing FPS for original 1.6 players to new comers. From the all new graphics to the awesome inclusion of weapon skins and different knives, brilliant maps (Writing from having a Operation Bravo Pass as well) and amazing community this sets CS:GO to be a great game. While the original formula (T kills CT, CT kills T, T plants bomb/gaurds hostage, CT defuses bomb/rescues hostages) is still a brilliant way to experience CS:GO, with new gamemodes 'Arms Race' and 'Demolition' the gaming experience just got better. If you find yourself tired of these gamemodes after lots of play, the community steps in to help. With hundreds of great community servers to choose from, each sporting their own gameplay style, such as JailBreak, Glassfloors and Zombies you're sure to keep coming back to this game time and time again. It's addictive!
FaZe TW*;-;10/10 Great Game!

DJ EGGWHITES;-;It's great except hit detection is sometimes awful, and the fact that when you want to play competative matches you'll tend to find the laggiest matches in history.
Bugele;-;Any gamemode you play you will be either called a hacker or be  talked, but you get skins and stickers for guns 10/10
Andermon;-;I hate this game. It really isn't even that good. But I can't stop playing it. It is in my every waking thought. At work, on the toilet, with friends, making love, all I can think about is CS:GO. My wife and children have left, now I keep myself occupied turning tricks for Stattraks. The things I've done just for virtual rifles would frighten most, but that's what I've been pushed to.
Crixus;-;Great game!!!.....worthy successor of CS:S...
Joker;-;hehe pew pew
Noo3z;-;Realy awesome game ^.^
Thomas The Fap Engine;-;When it comes down to it, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive may follow the same old formula of gameplay seen in previous versions of Counter-Strike, but it's still a well-rounded tactical shooter. It may not try anything drastically different or revolutionize the series by taking it in a new direction, but there's still enough there to appeal to newbies and hardcore fans alike.
Paquito;-;The BEST GAME EVER!!!
R!SH!;-;Best Tactical Shooter Ever 10/10.

SlyBoy87787;-;One time I went into this random server and there were about 20 people, good guys and bad guys, and they were making a pyramid. They were all so happy. They saw me and said, "Hey, , we need one more person for the top!" They smiled. I climbed up their eager bodies and stood at the top, believing what I was seeing; a whole world and all that lay before me was justice and understanding and people coming together. When I was done unloading my AK-47 into the tops of people's heads, chaos broke out. Sides turned on eachother, brother killed brother, blood filled the room. They cursed my name and said I was banished from the game forever. I believed them but vowed I would return to reclaim my place at the top. Now, more than 10 years later, I am ready to kill those who have wronged me. Actually it's hard. This game is hard: 8/10
Berg [HL] [VGS];-;CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play, where you play 10 games that you cannot leave (unless you want to tarnish your reputation), after which you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair no matter what skill level you are. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.

Cpt. Cactus - Trading All Skins;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a near perfect FPS. It has a ton to offer considering it is an MP only game. It is extremely easy to jump from CS 1.6 or CS Source into this game and do just fine. It is also very friendly to people who are new to the Counter-Strike series. Overall I HIGHLY recomended this game.

HAZE10210;-;This game is Awesome, i love the maps and the graphics Best PC shooter yet and it is also very cheap as u can see
sausaurje;-;Currently the best competitive FPS indeed ! It is difficult to take in hand the game at the beginning, but with some practice, you should get the mechanics of the game. The strong point is that VALVe publishes updates regularly but also brings a support for the eSport with "eSport cases", team sticker or event cashprize (ESL One, DreamHack). VALVe is also close to the community and also helps map maker with the Operation/Season Pass like Operation Breakout or Operation Phoenix, so you can play community map in competitive mode ! The weak point imo, is the community, you're a noob, ou you're a cheater. Furthermore, there are many cheater when the game is cheap on Steam, but these low prices are usually followed by many VAC ban... This game does not look like other games as the Call of Duty Saga (this game is for child and noob) and they want to make money, CS:GO is a real competitive game which knows how to evolve and which knows how to listen to his community pro and casual community ! GL & HF ! Thanks VOLVO :D
sanic;-;This game is very nice. I enjoy it a lot.
\_()_/;-;Just awesome and perfect game <3
https://;-;luv this game, personally much better than source
RvB VacationBoose #1440pFINALLY;-;Takes some getting used to after 1.6 and source, but still the best true fps ever made. 10/10.
Nathan;-;Counter Strike Global Offensive has a perfect mix of Casual and Competetive Gaming. If you are just starting out on the game you can play modes such as deathmatch, demolition and arms race before jumping in to competetive. Competetive is the perfect way to prove yourself as a good player as you will be placed in to games based on your competetive rank which is good for new-comers to the game. I personally enjoy the competetive aspect of the game over casual although I have noticed a few faults with in the matchmaking system. Sometimes somebody who is a low level gold (such as myself) you are sometimes placed in to a game with the top level golds or sometimes even Master Guardians. This could be because the MG's are playing with their lower leveled friends or it may be the system trying to test your level for promotion. I would give this game a 8/10 and recommed it to anybody who hasn't tried it.
mnx;-;It's awesome!
Errno;-;This game is great! When I first played it, it was in beta, and I thought it's a crap game. However after recently buying it, I noticed that it has changed a lot since beta, and I enjoy playing it. If someone likes CS:Source but has never tried CS:GO before, then I recommend buying this. I think it's a lot better than CS:Source ever was.
death by snusnu;-;Such an improvement to CS:S. If you like CS then you'll love CS:GO.
hit man no mercy #Eid mubarak :D;-;Best game , it has some skins and gun styles , but it need high graphics to have the ability to play this game in high fps 100+

Remix Dave;-;I do not have a lot of hours on this game, but from playing CSS and CS 1.6 I can say they have done an outstanding job. I love Counter Strike and will always love the game, people care about graphics pfffft, it is all about gameplay and this game has it. It is 1000x better than COD and all other first person shooter, if you are looking for a game that will bring a lot of fun to you this is the game to get. Once you get into it, you can never stop playing from how fun the game is, best gameplay, best first person shooter and I strongly recommend this game.
n0_ch4nce;-;Counter Strike has come a long way since it was a Half-Life mod in the late 90's and is still just as fun as the first day I played it. If you're looking to purchase an FPS that will outlast any COD or Battlefield game you've ever owned stop here. We've been playing on the same core maps since the beginning and we still come back for more. There's no other FPS experience like it. Valves best title in my opinion.
Gullfounder;-;Game play is same as CS 1.6. Better graphics new Weapons and new Gameplay mods. I highly recommand this game. But if you are in Pakistan, It will be hard for you to find Servers of this game.

_SWIZZ;-;I got this game a while ago from a friend's reccomendation, and I am very pleased. It took away tons of money that I had sitting around, and turned it into digital files called skins. These skins can be put on resumes and businesses count it almost as if you majored in 5 different degrees. All i'm saying is that I do not regret buying this game one bit. Do I regret spending all of the money I did to unbox? Yes.

Mammilla;-;you go pew pew at the bad men and they're like "i ing shank yo mum"
Ryards;-;There is alot of fun achievments.
Nam*;-;This game is about losing friends, be it through failing to trade kills or teamflashing, or failing to find a more fulfilling and/or lucrative hobby or the lack of social development because you're too busy trying to defend your actions in competitive. 10/10, great work, Valve. raise your glass, here's to 10 more years of CS.
Zc;-;Buy this game if you want to ruin your life and get addicted to spending more money than you need to.
Mellow;-;First of this is CS so you should already know what you are getting into, there is no better fps game out there in my opinion. I personally like the mode Competitive the most, but there is alot of servers out there that is quite entertaining like climb, surf, aim maps etc..... there is an endless opportunity in this game. If you are looking at getting better in FPS games in general this is the game you should go from, CS will teach you the most basic & the most advanced. As you can tell by my hours, i do absolutely love this game. Hope this helped you ^^
.ghaz#;-;Well, it's Counter-Strike. So buy it and shut up.

Jamesy;-;Good game, lots of fun. Many chickens killed.
Xeasi;-;Very fun and addicting game! Marketing with weapon skins can also bring you a big profit, if you're lucky enough.
joshO;-;Quit cod for this game. Simply amazing
Surprise Buttsex;-;Really cool game! Its a new Counter Strike and it's just awesome!
StInKy FUPA;-;CS:GO is a trully revolutionary expirience in gaming. You get to fly jets and take down skyscrapers. This game has the realism of 300% ot of 7% possible. Getting headshots is really rewarding, you feel as if you just shot someone in the face...people rarely enjoy when I unexpectedly spray my heavy load all over their faces and chest (load of bullets that is). I give this gave a trillion coins...which means that the metascore for it is 98 (ing Awesome !!!).
>>>TheRussian;-;i never played this game for a single second ever in my life but apparently i can write a review about it cool
GG Sandstorm;-;Absolutely a nice game -Nice gameplay -Ranking system -Trading system for skins is pretty awesome and the system about the skins overall
Reika;-;I bought this gun skin the other day and it looks pretty. The guns are so pretty. The stickers are super pretty! This is the prettiest game I've ever tried. The gameplay was okay too.
Blammo;-;I have this game
kizunever;-;lol nothin like cod but its ok. no akimbo  that, also you can;t aim down the sight?? wtf anyway, for poor kids id reccomend this game (15bucks lol) but id rather play CODghosts when this game has dogs ill play, also needs an epic campaign mode
Pig Benis;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive stole all of my money and ruined my social life. Don't regret it one bit, totally worth it 10/10. Damnit Valve, you've done it again! Some of its awesome features: This game focus' on realism, incorporates real world elements: -You can climb ladders without using your hands!! -You can defuse an armed bomb by looking at it!!! -You can only aim with guns that come with scopes (which is like 4!!), all other guns are hip fired!! -You sound like a fat Elephant plodding around when you're running, but when you walk slowly you're as silent as a shadow! -Ragdolls!!!! -Realistic bullet physics and bullet spread!!! -Fall damage!!!! -Friendly Fire!!!! -Jumping!!!!! -Crouching!!!! -Running!!!! -Walking!!!! -Awesome gun skins that come in various qualities and conditions!!! -The ability to show off your awesome gun skins in-game!!!! -Excellent A.I!!!! -Excellent A.I Names!!!!! I don't know what else Valve could do to make the game even MORE fun and realistic!! Valve sure hit the nail on the head with this game!!
Dwight;-;Best game...ever. Co-op with friends is amazing!
Krenol;-;This is just a marketing game, even it's named Global Offensive, so its abbreviation come out as GO (DAT MARKETING SKILLS THO), nothing global in this game (although there are some new maps that take place in a different part of the world), but if you liked the CS 1.6, you'll defenitelly like this as much, because the developers were too afraid to adapt any new mechanincs in the game, even the ridiculous ladder climbing remained the same. (They could have made an animation for climbing, but many say that that would slow the gameplay, but not if the character would step two ladder rungs instead of one, or something like this) It's just looks horrible among the few realistic mechanisms But while they tryied to implement realism (the way you have to aim with the scope with rifles) the aiming system is still... well... "undeveloped" to me. It's a good thing that the most liked maps like dust and assault are still in it, and they are all improved with destroyable doors, barrels and other objects, and in the game, not all weapons works the same way, that's a good thing again! This is why it's hard to say wheter I recommend it or not. I, of course recommend from an aspect that many players bougth the game, the 1.6 version were so popular, I BET you have a friend on your list who play this game, but in the other hand this game is nothing but a poor work making new source of money in my opinion. But saying positive again for conclusion, I'm an audiophile, and I LOVE its music, the music system is very well made, when you get killed the dramatic music kicks in and so on, and I can't complain about its graphics if I look away from the animations. Overall, yes, I recommend this game.
a gwopstahp;-;Favorite Counter Strike hands down. Competitive modes, awesome graphics, weapon skins, and amazing new maps make it perfect.
Blackhawk;-;More like Counter-Strike: watch me carry ALL THESE NEWBS.
alpacas are in greg!!111!;-;Why won't CSGO blink over Call of Duty? CSGO holds a spatial expert. The distant approval consumes the orchestra. An orange pacifier garages the breakfast. Call of Duty remedies the history with the context.
Guala;-;Point Point Shoot Shoot
I0.light;-;Counter Strike SOURCE is much better than global offensive. Unfortunately, this game CSS will no longer continue develop from valve. Otherwise, the game is totally OK! From time to time! :) Have Fun!
BOT Dorami;-;One of the best FPS games available!! A must have title for those who like FPS games
[e]Sh@rpshooter;-;Being playing Counter-Strike for 10 years and i have to say that the new Version defintily have some improvement but it doesnt have all the maps 1.6 and source have except on community server. The inclusion of competitive gameplay now helps to regulate competitve players to play in a competiton style. While there is a casual style for non-competitive people to play. This game is a definitly must to play if you are veteran of Counter Strike !
BOUDENE DERANK;-;I now have over 1.2k hours on all of my accounts combined and it's still as fun as the day I bought it, if not even more. I love Counter Strike Global Offensive and can see myself playing this game for years on end. This is the most value I have gotten for my money ever. I encourage any person either pro or just got on pc, buy Counter Strike Global Offensive, there is a spot for every one here. This means either pro scrims, or pick up games with people on your skill level.
nXs-iNfAmOuS;-;Best FPS game ever .... Each and every gamer in this world must own this one....

Revan The Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

KillaH;-;Really worth the money!
Fungixl;-;ARE YOU READY TO GET REKT? Have stoned French-Canadians insult your mothers during more built-in game modes than ever before! Re-live the good 'ol days when E-peens were measured in obscure unicode characters and baseless accusations of hacking. No longer does tryhard AWPing in a deathmatch have to be bland and repetetive: With hats for your guns, you can buy a whole set of AWPs! Team-flashing not enough for you? Conflagrate your fellows with molotovs and incediaries! Render entire corridors impassable and block off escape routes with prodigious incompetence! The hero is you in Counter Striking Global Offensive!
Cryooooooooooooo;-;Most passive fps ever... god its terrible. A+
w1z1k;-;Probably the best Counter-Strike at the moment. It just keeps getting more features : competitive mode, matchmaking, skins for guns to raise funds for CS league, video and highlights from all your past matches, watch live games, better hostages mode, gun game mode includes. However, they just keep adding stuff without fixing all the issues and bugs from past updates. This games is unplayable for some people over the Internet but great in LAN. The gun skins update brought lower fps to the game, going down by 80 to 120 fps.
Tangawizi;-;great game all around and CoD is bad

420 $ :S;-;Love it!
DEVIL;-;It's a good game! :D
Richard Kings;-;It is quite a change. CS:GO is clearly not the same game as CSS or 1.6. Weapons feel more realistic, and the gameplay feels a lot stiffer than CSS. There are new weapons and introduces very different aspects to the already famous game. This time around it really feels like a professionals game. Nontheless, CS:GO is very fun, and if you're a fan of the Counter-Strike series, i think you'll enjoy this too. You just have to get used to the new mechanics. It's not the best of the lot, but Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a welcome change to the CS community.
annieareyouok;-;If you shoot and kill someone, he doesn't die for real. I killed some guys few times in a row. Thats good, you should try it.
ejg;-;This is the best game ever plz subscribe
MUZZIJSbe;-;If you like old good cs 1.6. and you wonna somthing more realistic, just buy this game! 10/10 / addicted, the Creator
21egroeg | 1 Yr Banniversary;-;If you haven't got this game already then it is worth the buy. If you thought Counter Strike: Source was good, wait until you get your hands on this.
goonts;-;I LOVE THIS GAME!
goonts;-;I LOVE THIS GAME!
OprahsKanklezz;-;If you're into ing es and getting money, this is the game for you. It's a simple concept: Kill people, earn money, buy things with said money, kill more people with the stuff you buy. It's fun for the whole family!!!! 8=====D
Termi...ne maara ?;-;This is the most addictive game I have ever played. The various co-op maps make it more interesting. Then there is badge system which lets you know where you stand in the game community. You come back again and again to take your rank up. This game is really awesome.
Keen;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) the newest addition to the Counter-Strike franchise supposedly takes the best from both its most famous predecessors, Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike Source. I as a person who has played 1.6 for approximately 8 years cannot confirm that wholy, but I can at least say that the game is fun to play, with the biggest advantage it has over it's older brothers being the matchmaking. I would easily pay Valve $100 for 1.6 with the matchmaking from CS:GO. But that is not gonna happen so for the time being I just have to settle with what CS:GO offers. I might have sounded a little more negative than I wanted. The graphics are nice enough even though well aged Source engine, although with the newest tweaks, cannot compare with latest AAA production. Apart from new look you will find your all time favorites from previous Counter-Strike games, same goes for weapons and game mods. However there is not only an old content. You will find couple of new guns and what I appreciated most were new maps created by community and published in buy-able packs by Valve providing the creators with part of earnings. Later on the game suffered an attack of "dropable" content. Fortunately Valve did not step over cosmetic changes, so you can only spend your hard earned bucks on different weapons skins, at least for now.
Rashka;-;this is a great game in many ways it is more accessible then the 1.6 version (which was already very accessible). but new players are able to learn how to play very fast and their enjoyment is greater then the one they would have had at the start of 1.6 or cs source. but on the other hand there is one little gripe i have and it is that i balive they made it to simmple, and when i say little i mean tiny, so the gripe is only personal i believe and it shouldn't effect your gameplay. enjoy the game :)
ThePoopDeck;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive, what a game. In my opinion MONEY WELL WORTH SPENT! Every penny you invest in this game is worth it. You must have the teamwork/coop skills as in Battlefield.. And the small map skills as in Call of Duty.. Yet there is multiple things we must have forgot! ~Your OWN skill matchmaking ~SKINS!!!!! ~A wide variety of REAL weapons still being used today ~Automatic communications ~Team chat ~Medals/Achievments/Badges to collect and earn ~A fancy skill level to show the world you are awesome ~You can make your own skins for a PROFIT ~Realistic gameplay such as weapon recoil, damage, and graphics This game also works very smoothly with just about every computer. 10/10 no if, ands, or buts. ~Mr. J

Lad;-;As expected from valve, a very well made and balanced game where being skilled rewards you. It has a side economy consisting of skins to your weapons and different knives that you use in combat. Gr8 game vovlo r8 8/8 m8

SuFixT #Scammed;-;This is a ok for right now could be a lot better. Csgo has changed a lot. I first off enjoy the game because of the competiveness and the skill that is needed, but they are a few problems. Like hit dections and the rekt-9. The new meta of the game "run and gun" should not even be in the game. Lets say you have a guy who is good with an ak. He misses his headshot because the guy is running with a smg jumping around. In theory the guy with the ak should have killed him but no since the spread of bullets when running is like a circle the guy with an ak is died. That most often happens in the silvers. Also not to mention there are a bunch of cheaters in this game. I think valve really has to step up there game with the cheaters because they are a lot out there. They are ruining the game for people. Also the smurfs. I have found a solution for this. The reason why people smurf is because they dont want to play with cheaters. It is like a circle. If there is a cheater in the higher ranks the guy who is not cheating will want to buy a smurf so he doesnt play with cheaters. If valve steps up there game with cheaters then they wont be any smurfs. Now back with the "run and gun." The rekt-9 is the most over used gun in my opinion. You dont even have to aim for the head because you mostly are going to get a headshot with it. Also the most over used gun in the silvers is the p90. I dont see a lot of p90s. The reason why i hate it. It is because the moving spread of the p90. You also have 50 bullets. Basicly you and just spray with it. That is my review If there is a update of csgo with the meta change I will update my review.

Jishoa;-;Great Game. Just awesome. Best ever wow.
amidacos;-;Rage simulator 2014 10/10 would waste hundreds of hours playing
That Kid From Texas;-;This game is by any case or point like a BF or C.o.d. This game has no super AC-130's no nukes no tanks no nothin! That might sound boring but it is not! The game is amazing you have to put in so much moar than just run around and kill. You have to talk to your te m mates and play safe. Buy the right weapons at the right time! Throw a granade and blind a enemy, then take them out. What makes this game great for me is the team work and the just the love for it *I just can't tell why, I just love the game!* This is not like C.O.D. wean 1 preson guns down a whole team. No, if you just run in with no help, even with super skill! You will get gunned down. So you need to tell your team mates so they can help. And the learning curv for this game is the gun recoil and clutch. Yeah the game is fully based on recoil. You have to studdy and try and try agen to get the best shot! I with 160 hours is still haveing a blast! With new gun skins everymonth and new maps! Yeah there are skins in this game. Kinda based on TF2 with *Stat Trak* Being like a *Strange* and knifes being like hats. So yeah this is Vavle. And if you know valve they like making money of pixels. So yeah items can range from 00.2 cents, to 1000$. So yeah, there is that. But the guns don't make you better, they don't do anything! So this game does not force you to buy things after you buy the game! If your looking for a new FPS or tacticool shooter, or you liek war-team work shooter. If you want to know the bases of the game it is that there is two teams. (Terrorist) and (Counter terrorists) Terrorists try to plant a bomb and make it explode. They have A, or B bomb site and they have to plant the bomb and try to protect it till it goes boom. The counter terrorists want to kill all the terrorists, or if the terrorsits planted the bomb they try to defuse it. If the bomb explodes the Terrorists win. If the bomb is defused the Counter terrorists win. IF the Terrorists kill all of the Counter terrorists the The terrorists win. And if the Counter terrorists kill all of the terrorists. And also the Terrorists get a time limit, if that time limit runs out before they plant the bomb or kill all of the Counter terrorists, they lose. There is also a hostage saveing game. Which you can think of what it is. Thank you for reading my review! Sorry for eny Eeeeglish mistakes I made. Im not that great.... *This game was breath taking 10000000000/10

DarK_St3alth;-;Rank: 8/10 Recommendation(s): Play other Counter-Strike titles before, and get off those silly actiony FPS titles. Major Theme: Skills in FPS, this game sets the standard and is the standard globally. Bought at Price: $13 - Preorder special The Counter-Strike series/franchise has grown up with Valve over time. Instead of trying to come up with something completely new  and ultimately wreck games like EA  Valve looks at ways to stick to the roots and build off that. The biggest issue I should address before anything else is mechanics. Counter-Strike is not about realism (which is the first thing I point out to newbies), but rather mechanics... The game mechanics have been modernized. That is a fact of life, and thus has made the game more accessible to people. Some people wish Counter-Strike: Global Offensive would have been a simple graphical upgrade to Counter-Strike 1.6 or Counter-Strike: Source. Put it this way, you will always loose people in game transitions. There was outcry in the community when backend changes were made in Counter-Strike: Source. Valve has made mistakes in that title (like the famous scaling purchases system) but has learned from that and moved on. The community in some regards hasn't moved on, and crys about almost anything it can. Common problems 1.6/Source players have: This HUD is way to big. My gun sways when I move. My gun takes time to get to where I'm aiming. It doesn't run on my toaster anymore. FOV doesn't scale like it used to. These probably don't matter to the vast majority of people, but for people who take CS seriously, they had or still have issues to this day with those items. Valve, just like other games, allows you to customize your experience. It doesn't have to be workshop, but the backend settings are exposed for you in menus. It is obvious that the game is designed for consoles in mind, but the options are there to make it YOUR game. For instance, I prefer the older style of crosshair. Maybe I'm old school, but that's just what works for me. I can press a few buttons or even console settings if it gets down to that, and I get a crosshair I want. I should make a quick note, even I don't like some of the changes made. Most recently "Gun Game" or Arms Race was updated to make it more even. In doing so, top players from each team are in a sense, punished by being made globally visible for a period of time during and after shooting. In addition, instead of 1 kill to 1 level, it's now 2 kills or 1 knife kill. Killing a team leader means an instant level up instead of the 2 normal kills. These changes have left a bad taste in my mouth, and thus I no longer play the gamemode. Speaking of gamemodes, the new demolition mode allows people who are new to get a grip on one bomb site before they play the standard two bomb site maps in casual and competitive modes. Unlike before, Valve has integrated a standard competitive mode which allows for easy comparison of skill level. You can still play the classic "Casual" mode with large team sizes. Enough on mechanics I guess. Moving on, Valve has added a weapon skin system into the game. This is very much like Dota 2 and TF2, where they are simply cosmetic items. You can look in the market and see some of these items are listed and sell at above the $200 mark. Graphics wise, the game still shows some console optimizations on the PC, such as windows showing up black from a distance with a sniper scope. This is the area portal working, and can be addressed. Other than that, it's basically a Portal 2 branch. To sum it up, mechanics are a big part of CS:GO, and they take a while to learn. They have been updated, along with the graphics, to make the game more accessible to everyone outside of the "hardcore cs community".
Jib Pibbily;-;Killed a chicken and got points. 69/10
Jimmy left go!!;-;this is really an awesome game!! love it!!!

ShadeOfGuns;-;starting to have mixed feeling about this game now, now that i have been playing for a while im noticing how many hackers/ ddosers i have ran into and i think that VAC needs to keep up with the program. other than that its a pretty good competative shooter thats easy to get into.
ZeDuck;-;This game is 4 stronk ppl :D
Jonny;-;The is one of the greatest games there is out on team. The quality of the game is absolutely extraordinary! Worth every second playing it.
J_FF;-;I definetley recommend this game. Such a fun, competitive game. Love the competitiveness and the casual play options. Good game for the heavy pro gamers and the light, casual gamers. Overall, an awesome game.
DotaMasterMind | Kharidari shod!;-;Perfect
Nam*;-;This game is about losing friends, be it through failing to trade kills or teamflashing, or failing to find a more fulfilling and/or lucrative hobby or the lack of social development because you're too busy trying to defend your actions in competitive. 10/10, great work, Valve. raise your glass, here's to 10 more years of CS.
Zc;-;Buy this game if you want to ruin your life and get addicted to spending more money than you need to.
Mellow;-;First of this is CS so you should already know what you are getting into, there is no better fps game out there in my opinion. I personally like the mode Competitive the most, but there is alot of servers out there that is quite entertaining like climb, surf, aim maps etc..... there is an endless opportunity in this game. If you are looking at getting better in FPS games in general this is the game you should go from, CS will teach you the most basic & the most advanced. As you can tell by my hours, i do absolutely love this game. Hope this helped you ^^
goose;-;Great multiplayer game worth the money. The trading is fun too!

Brand [Fir3Fli3];-;It's a really fun shooter game. You don't have to be very experienced to play it either, all pro's are on one specific game mode, playing one specific map. It's fun for everyone and I can definitely recommend it to everyone.

Mr. Hunter;-;OOH YEAH, DO VR MISSION, BECOME REAL GOOD SOLDIER IRL, GET BABES. But really, probably the most fun I've had with friends in an FPS since Team Fortress 2.
Elmo;-;Great Game. If you know how to actually use tactics. Hope you haven't played COD before you played this. You will have a slight problem

dankel;-;would definately recommend, dankkush/10, this aint no skunk  - real. lean to jump real far and smoke up in key positions, if thats not for you just kill arabs in the name of america (btw if you are arab you can also kill americans)
Mrten Vessla;-;Spend alot of time aquiring skins or failing miserably at competitive. 420/666 would buy a happy meal for gaben.
Cyrus;-;CS:GO is a amazing, first person shooter, with great graphics and oneline play. There are quite a few guns here that are easy to learn, but hard to master. The tutorial is in depth and quite fun, but agent humans, there are lots of stratigies to play. The diversity of maps and gamemodes is alot for games of these type, from large and small maps to hostage scenerios to straight up deathmatch. This game is highly fun and is a good pc version of a fps, but still has potential as COD and Battlefield are also there for console gamers.
=DR=Ben Llama;-;Play Competitive Mode.
Frankilled;-;Warning: this game includes voice chat, make sure to disable it or to fart out loud in your microphone. Great game.

_OmaxxT3ckton1k_;-;)) , , .     1.6,  Source,., ,  -.
Mr. Annte;-;Dunno Why I need to write a review. I came in this game from TF2 while trying to get competitive, and CS GO just has this. However, this is CS GO, Not CS 1.6, so don't use the deagle, there is no deagle round, THIS DOESN'T EXIST. definitly a fun game to challenge yourself, but don't forget it's a game. when you do, and rank is everything, it's just worthless.
rT -.-;-;According to my point of view the best functioning und balanced online-competitive fps-shooter with a creative community, that always is integrating their content into the game. Thats what makes CS:GO so special, it is developing all the time. Recommendable without any concerns!
Neiva;-;Very Nice. I like this gamer. I love IT.....
General;-;pretty good
UBERNAAB.<3;-;If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get the money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob the bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.

RETIRED;-;One of the best game I have ever played.
BOBZILLA;-;Its like tf2 with gun skins instead of hats Bought this game for like 2 keys, then i ended up getting up turning this game into a money maker. With all the things i got from this game, i managed to buy a copy of Goat Simulator (amazing game), and have some keys to blow off and unbox, and have some nice  StatTraks to play around with. i turned those 2 keys into at least over $50 in total. Making skins in this game is a fun thing to do also, hopefully one day one of my skins will be accepted into the game

Ryloth #Schuble Must Die;-;There has been a great deal of controversy on whether the game fulfilled the peoples' expectations and whether it deserves to be considered as worthy as its ancestors. Many positive points to be noticed: Great graphics (for a cs game) and Satisfying gameplay that can make you unable to stop playing, especially if playing with friends. On the negatives, compared to the previous titles, it has many things that devs could fix/improve. Plus, the matchmaking system is not working as expected, and as it seems, no serious efforts are made to change that. Last but not least, i have to point that the cs go community is likely the worst. Still, worth buying. 7/10 nearly 700 hours of gameplay (multiple accounts)

Cincast;-;It's Team Fortress 2's big brother... Not as fun but can kill people TF2 has hats Battlefield has nice maps COD isn't serious I faced CSGO with inexperience Buy the game if you like to shoot people and get funny stickers on your guns You can shout Allahu Akbar to other players when you get a kill 6/3
halcott;-;This game is the best! I would perfer it anyday over Source or "GAY-V.A." It combines a skill game with a mostly mature community to make a wonderful game. I would recommend this game highly. It will take you a little bit to learn the recoil but once you get it you'll be having a lot of fun!
Kaiser;-;Possibly the greatest shooter series ever. Forget CoD forget Battlefield, this is where the skill and fun really is at. It just has so much replay value it's unbelieveable, it's good that they've included all the old CS weapons and their weapon sounds and maps. Counter strike is a very tactical game so spraying won't work, if your are a CoD noob and want to play this game, learn how to master trigger control first. Game is very enjoyable and I cannot recommend this game enough!! :)

Anus Vinegar;-;If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place. Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

They will attempt to rip your soul out of your body with no remorse. And along with every smurf comes a chroma case so devilishly advertised in front of your unsuspecting naive face. You finally have enough money for a key and when you open it.....a negev skin, proudly displayed. as if it has any worth. LOATHE BEHOLD, to escape your misery you fire up a round of some competitive gameplay. AND GOD HAS SPOKEN, THOU SHALT NOT REGISTER.

Rizaldi_Farhan;-;The Good Game
sausaurje;-;Currently the best competitive FPS indeed ! It is difficult to take in hand the game at the beginning, but with some practice, you should get the mechanics of the game. The strong point is that VALVe publishes updates regularly but also brings a support for the eSport with "eSport cases", team sticker or event cashprize (ESL One, DreamHack). VALVe is also close to the community and also helps map maker with the Operation/Season Pass like Operation Breakout or Operation Phoenix, so you can play community map in competitive mode ! The weak point imo, is the community, you're a noob, ou you're a cheater. Furthermore, there are many cheater when the game is cheap on Steam, but these low prices are usually followed by many VAC ban... This game does not look like other games as the Call of Duty Saga (this game is for child and noob) and they want to make money, CS:GO is a real competitive game which knows how to evolve and which knows how to listen to his community pro and casual community ! GL & HF ! Thanks VOLVO :D
sanic;-;This game is very nice. I enjoy it a lot.

git awf;-;CS:GO is a fun, competive game for competing aganist players and settling scores, but it seems like CS:GO is going to become the new TF2. Why must I say that? Well, because they're adding tradable weapons, crates, keys, and trading in general. Soon, just like TF2, CS:GO shall be free to play, then everything just becomes really overrated. But overall, fun game to play.
Hiraeth;-;Very addicting.
Pinhead Larry;-;Yo, this game is gud. 10/10 piggies
Conversionx;-;Good and stuff i recommend this , for people who have swage.
T0talN1nja;-;One of the greatest FPS of all time. Highly addictive and provides hours and hours of fun, you simply just cannot go wrong with this game, especially if you can even make profit from it! Definitely a worthwhile experience for all your FPS Gamers out there, now enough of that, get out there 360 no scope some n00bs and make them take a ing seet m8!! CS GO is luv CS GO is lyf.
Darkness Rush;-;This game is amazing! I was a Call of Duty player and after some time I realized how bad it actualy is, so I thought I need something new and I saw this game on sale and I though why not? And it was awesome! First at all the matchmaking works great it's not like when your new your gonna ger dropped in all those high ranked skilled players but with people which have around the same skill as you. Second you need a lot more skill and teamwork for this here is an example: when you're on the terrorist team you need to plant the bomb at site A or B. But on the other hand when you're on the Counter terrorists team you don't know where they are going so you need like 3 people to A and 2 to B if somebody gets shot at A you need your team to help up there. you need quite some skill and a good eye to play this game because you can't aim down your sights and you need to learn the recoil patterns. you also have gamemodes like deathmatch and arms race which need an small improvement on the spawns but after all it's a great way to improve your aim and learning your recoil patterns. You can even earn some money out of it by getting camo's and cases and sell them on the market I made like 10 euro's out of it and bought new weapons for it, how AWESOME is that!? but now we're comming to a verdict I'm giving this game an 10/10 One of the best First person shooters I played :')
i liek pie;-;This game is dank i mean dank u cant even scope and u can 420 no scoeps wit teth awperino and im sponsored by doritos cus im friberg in NiP

Tasu;-;Salt Simulator 2015 11/10 - IGN "Thanks for the salt, I needed some with my french fries."
al3mon3;-;1 Year ago, i was like "CS:S and CS 1.6 are MUCH better than GO". But now i think diffrent. CSS and CS 1.6 is better for just casual and fun-gaming (custom maps). CS:GO is much more of a competitive Game. It's easier to get into the competitive scene and it's thougt to be a "serious" Counter-Strike. I only have one problem with this game. I think the ranking system is too much random. Often you feel like:"I played vs. guys 5 Ranks higher, won 2 times in a row and was both times top fragger. Why no rankup? But for this Problem you have many solutions, I'd like to go and play on the many even more competitive Gamemodes on "Faceit, CEVO or ESEA". Because there counts more to your rank. Like Entry frags, clutches and so on. I recommend this game to everyone, who knows what he is buying. Don't buy this game if you expect Call of Duty or Battlefield feeling. Buy this Game if you want to master it, play serious and play competitively.

Bleson;-;Internetpeli of the year) Ez Internetkatka
bassturd :)))));-;I can climb ladders and surf using my ribcages 10/10-ign
Thirdrail;-;An FPS with MMO-style drops and items. This game does a lot of things right, and a couple things wrong (casual play is slightly skewed by an overabundance of the cheesiest sniper rifle ever put in an FPS), but all in all it's fun and addictive and a great way to hang out with your friends. 400+ hours in a game that cost me $4. It's hard not to recommend a game which presents that kind of dollar to time ratio.
Macheti;-;Great FPS with a unique over-arching game mechanic (Terrorists Vs Counter-Terrorists) that is quite fun, and most of the time requires lots of strategy to be implemented. I've shot more chickens than players. 10/10

WhereIsRemi?;-;If I had a choice of getting my  cut off or never be playing this game again, id choose getting my  cut off.
Teque5;-;CSGO continues the brutal, infuriating, and wonderful Counter-Strike series that taunts you to be a better player with every game. I was somewhat skeptical during the beta before the addition of the casual mode, but the continuous updates and gameplay additions makes it the new TF2 in my mind. The bifurcation of competitive from casual and gungame does a good job grouping players with like minds. This title is endlessly playable with a vibrant community that is quite a bit more mature than the cod (fish?) players that slime around the net. The map system and continued mod extensibility makes it a premiere title on steam. My lame complaints (No more TMP) (MP7/UMP are too awful) (Aimpunch kinda broken) don't really detract from the goodness to be had. Graphics got a very nice upgrade over source and most of the maps got carried over. 9/10 for my next obsession.
Savoff CrimsonBets *;-;The best game ;]
Darth Nikolai;-;To start, this game (as realized in many discussions with others on the matter), is one of the most, if not THE most tactical shooters on the face of the earth. The elegant pacing of the battle between the T's and CT's is astoundingly well-done, and has my mind rushing to the planned calculations of chess matches. It is a player-controlled masterpiece, that doesn't need ambient story or environment to create it's appealing nature. The raw FPS skill that is needed to even contend in this game has me excited to keep playing and reach the top of the proverbial mountain day after day. Pick this game up, it will consume your FPS experience in the best way imaginably possible. At this price, you can't go wrong.
Mr. Bigglesworth;-;This game is the reason I don't have a girlfirend.... 10/10

James from the office;-;you know I love this game like genuinly do, but I just ing left a game and restarted my computer, and I made it back into the game before the ban, but because I wasn't in the game and playing I got ing banned, it really needs fixing so that when the player clicks reconnect the ban timer stops, because not only did I get 2 ing hour! I got deranked on a game I was banned from what ing fix it.

Kuro;-;I recommend CS:GO to veteran players and beginners alike as the game has a balanced community, you can meet people who are complete s yet find some that are rather tolerant. The graphics are OK for a game that was pretty recent and maps created by the community are also playable. If you're aspiring for an competitive environment this is the place for you!
Lucblast;-;This game is a very fun game to play, has skins , cases to open (which might empty your wallet). You get profit from this game also,while having fun you get case/skins drop you can sell and get other games you want!

Gaben Called Me For VACation!;-;Guns sound scary, especially sniper rifles, and detailed character dialogue keeps you in the combat loop.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is different than almost every other shooter because it demands intelligent, hardcore tactical play from every last one of its players.
LOK;-;The most balanced and competitive shooter out there right now, with one of the best dev teams behind it. CS GO is everything i wanted 1.6 to be years ago, and nearly 500 hours in I'm not bored of it yet.
CustomAbilities;-;What can I say... Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the better first person shooters, not because it has the better visuals or because the game has a more upstanding community but because the gameplay in this particular game was bred for competitive play. Counter-Strike has been achieveing this level competitive play since the begining and hasn't stopped since. If you are looking to pickup Counter-Strike: Global Offensive here are some reasons to persuade you to pick up CS:GO over it's competitors. 1. CS:GO is not about running and gunning - In CS:GO accuracy is everything and timing your shots could be the difference between life and death, where in games like Call of Duty and Battlefield where the game has a community of squeaking children who "dropshot" in order to get a kill, In CS:GO you will find it more likely than not if you run around and spray you will die more than you will frag, this is because of the accuracy system. 2. Unlike most other first person shooter games CS:GO requires alot of teamplay to actually achieve a victory in the competitive gamemodes. If you come into the game unprepared you will probably get yelled at by some experienced players but do not let them discourage you, you will become better and surpass even their skill level. Learn calls, smokes and any other tactical thing you can learn in this game to give yourself the edge and most of all never talk negative to your teammates as this will just provide stress and tension between your teammates and yourself. 3. Skill Groups are a big part of CS:GO, In games like battlefield and call of duty your skill group will always go up as you play the game and earn exp, but in CS:GO the ranking system is a little different, ELO is what CS:GO uses and it does a really good job of accurately matching you against an opponent of your skill level. Everytime you play a full competitve match of CS:GO whether it be a win or a loss your ELO will take a hit, so if you win your ELO ranking will increase and if you win most of your games you will end up at a higher skill group which is displayed by an ingame rank. If you lose most of your games you will most likely downrank which is fair as if you lose most of your games you probably do not belong in your skill group and got there by pure luck or beating other people that do not belong at their skill group. 4. Skins - Alot of people hated skins when they first added them as they thought the game was going through a transformation into Team Fortress 2 but they couldn't be more wrong about such an event. Skins were added to the game to be monetary gain and to show support for the game by making it so community members could create and possibly get their content implemented into the game. This allowed the general community to have a bigger impact on more things in the game. Skins come in all colors, shapes and sizes to fit the default guns in the game and add an artisitc visual to the game that is otherwise non-existant by the games map and other textures. Skins can also be traded and vary in prices so you can make money just from playing the game and also sink tons of dough into the game. 5. It's fun - This game will not always be fun as the learning curve in this game is massive and you will probably find yourself asking yourself why you are even playing this game but then you will remember that you want to learn how to be better and once you do the game will open up and become one of the better games you play as this game is has everything that other games from the same genre are missing. Keep playing and never giveup. This is just a taste of the game and everything else their is to love in CS:GO comes naturally to those that play the game frequently, I hope you read this review fully and are intrigued if you do not already own this game.
Rossoneri;-;Well spent time of my life. I don't regret 10/10
Yamada-Kun;-;This game has kept me entertained for a while. The matchmaking may be broken as  due to the overwhelming amount of smurfs you get in every game. The hacking in this game is becoming less of a problem as gaben and his team work to fix it. The price of this game is well worth it in my opinion.
Wombat;-;RIP in Pepperonis money :(
Hades;-;Great game for any FPS fans.

mew;-;This game is just great. Counter-strike has an incredible community that makes the game great to play. If you like very competitive games this is a great choice, if you aren't so much into the competitive side of games then you will have fun on the tons of community servers that feature great, fun gamemodes.
Sanya_307;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is very similar to Counter-Strike: Source adjusted for improved graphics and changes in the balance of the game. Generally speaking, this is a great shooter that will become as legendary as the Counter-Strike 1.6. 10/10

THOR THE GOD OF THUNDER;-;10/10 Would spend to much money on a game again.
Alddex;-;The king of FPS games! Buy it!,it's the best game you can buy on steam! (my opinion)
1776;-;This is by far the best game I've ever played. I like shooters, so that's what I tend to look for on steam. When you pick this game up, you're going to have to forget everything you know about modern shooters if you want to win. First off, the game has an insane competitive atmosphere. 5v5 matches that use a (mediocre) ranking system last up to 90 minutes at a time, leaving you on the edge of your seat for those clutch moments. The community is amazing at helping you learn the game, and you'll find the right people and the right playstyle. You have to be dedicated to win here, learning map call-outs and memorizing different plays, recoil patterns and likely spots where an enemy can be. It's a great game to pick up and play casually, but even better to go hardcore with your buddies. However, with every great game, there are bad parts to it. As mentioned before, the ranking system is slightly mediocre. Nobody really knows how it works but some games end up unfair. Next, you'll stumble upon hackers often, especially at the high high ranks. You can report them, and they'll get banned(most of the time), but most of the time you lose the game and you'll get deranked. (recent changes make it so that if a hacker is reported and banned, the loss will not count towards your official stats/wins, but if you do manage to win it still counts). Lastly, there's the workshop. If you're talented, you can make skins and maps for the community and if Valve likes them they go into weapon cases; then they can be sold on the market. Some weapons can run you up to $400 dollars while others are a measly 2 cents. OVERVIEW PROS: +Competitive scene +playing with buddies +awesome people you can meet +teamplay CONS: -Hackers -Scammers -s -Mediocre ranking Conclusion - if you like shooters and competitions, pick this game up for you and 4 of your friends and go own some noobs.
Mike Litoris;-;post2short.

Keith SURE;-;You can kill a chicken. 10\10
Killkorde;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a good fps game that may be hard at first especially if it is your first fps game. There are a few reasons it is hard, I find it hard because it is difficult for me to aim with no iron or attached sights because I am used to Call of Duty. It is also difficult to learn the different spray patterns of the guns that are available for use. There are a lot of things that you can learn ingame by hours and hours of playing, I mean I have played 800+ hours and I still can't use the ak properly xD. I definitely recommend that people give this game a go, I have enjoyed my experience so far.
xle Scope;-;This game has learned me the russian langugage like no other. After only one hour playing time I could understand and write most of the abusive words in russian. After two hours I could speek even buisness-russian fluently. After 2 days of playing and playing I got a russian ID and a russian Family I also took over the russian traditions and can walk in undees through deep snow. I fully am a russian right now. XD  ,      ,
Black Tmartn;-;Great game! Been playng since the release, been playing CS since CS:S. I mostly play competitive. And the ranking system is ok. I think it could be more "user friendly". By telling the player how close or far from ranking up or down. The only frustrating thing I've came across is SMURFS and wall hackers.
4 memes 1 yoseph;-;No minisentries 10/10 game of the year
Reo;-;In this game you are a Terrorist or an elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your characters hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money. Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend. In some maps, the Terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the Counter-Terrorists to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a "Hostage Rescue Kit", which somehow gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. When your character wears a kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinson's disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up and I highly recommend this game.

Fagmin;-;I bought this game in hopes to slay my one and only true enemy, chickens. Little did i know i was in for more than that. After spending 600 hours of learning Russian and killing chickens, one day a man came to me, he said " Bingo Bango Bongo Bish Bash Bosh " which obviously means "come join the ct" in russian. So i did. That was a mistake. We got dropped off by chopper to a German nuclear plant and we all rushed in with one of our members screaming "SILVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR". We went in with a PP-Bizon SMG and mine was painted with a Urban Hazard spray. It looked very Scarred. I watched everyone in my team get shot in the face as they walked in and i was alone. At that very moment, Lord Gaben came to me and said "I may give you power, but it will cost you" so I gave him all my steam credit and he granted godly powers to my PP-Bizon. I turned the corner and killed all the terrorist with funny hats in one clip. I defused the bomb and won. But at what cost. Little did I know that my powers also were a curse. I now wonder the Casual and spray with my Bizon to this day. In hopes that one day I will leave the silver rank. Want to know the curse? I cant. Never. Wont rank up past silver. You have been warned, this game will consume you, your life will be devoured by constant case opening and killing. The sad part? You will enjoy it, you sick f***

eXPRESS;-;There are several things Valve should improve and they keep ignoring them for a long time. Thats why my review is more negative than it could be... Biggest problems are definitely: - VAC (its poor anti-cheat) - 64 tick (we cant play this game on those standarts) - bad region selection for MM (playing with russians all the time, nothing personal) - we want to see how much percent of players are in each skill group or atleast in TOP4 which is considered proffessional (for sakes of motivation) - optimalize the game for more cores, especially for AMD Its not a complete list of the issues, but those are really worth a quick solution because only thing Valve is now doing is expeding stupid skins and operations, which brings almost no new joy to the game. Valve milks this  hard. :D 5/10 - Keep improving, CS is awesome game, stop milking skins and give us more unforgetable moments with this game through fluent and fair gameplay based on the skill and not cheats and also you can pump little bit more money into majors ;)
Col.Haze;-;Very good game addictive in every sense. I recommend it for fans of hardcore.
[ZDE] Aldwin L. | "DerNamenlose";-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the best shooters that i have ever seen and played. Yes, its hard and takes time to learn the Basic things like Recoil, Movement, etc. but if you got the knack its easy and makes fun to play other things like competetive. If you want to play competetive i recommend to play with your friends (team). Its better to coordinate. In my opinion the game worth its price!
Smiths;-;Plenty of fun, very competitive and interesting would recommend for the price!
epsilon;-;IGN 10/MUTHAFUKN10 BUY THIS  AND YOU TOO WILL BE ABLE TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON UNBOXING CASES AND GET BLUES!! I FUKN LUV IT WO0O0OOOOO

CHARPG;-;The best game on steam get it!
AsToN;-;I love this game <3
I dont care you broke your elbow;-;first off gameplay is fun and challenging but after playing constantly gets a bit bland. next up the real reason im writing this is for the skin system, i hate it like its horrible and people have lost to much money on it, i havent been trading for a while and my knife which was 250 is now 200, prices drop and theres a huge "market" crash right now, just a message dont get into trading please save yourself.... skins arent worth it
CSGOPoker.com - Gvazdas;-;Although the change from previous counter-strike games is questionable, the game is entertaining nonetheless.
TEEM ROKIT |LAB|;-;Super Competitive, Super fun, Super Castlevania IV, Super Addicting, Super Super
tobi (  );-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a very enjoyable game and is MUCH different from the rest in a good way. Keep up the good work Valve
Jeremy_;-;CS  --------WHAT A NICE GAME!!!!
vacbone;-;Brings back so much, they made it even better. 10/10.
Chobie;-;Its a good game, but the community is very toxic. If you do good you're a hacker and if bad or decent you're a loser. Well, not everyone can be satisfied. The skins are really cool. A lot of people play this game, but not too many people play it very seriously #matt #jaredsucks @Eugenious. However, I would recommend this to friends so I can smash unranked noobs
IMMORTAL TREASURE III;-;omg rip off of cs 1.6 ... K@pp@
_byte;-;As hard as it is to wrap my head around first-person shooters, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was unexpectedly one of the easier games to pick up and wrap my head around. I was always afraid of competitive- I'd never played a multiplayer match until about a month or so ago- and I never expected much by way of nice attitudes from the community. Boy, was I wrong. Bout 90% of the matches we hit had fair, nice, understanding, and overall good-hearted players. They'd understand if you made a mistake- and would help you through it on occasion. This game has its fair share of exploiters, hackers, and general douches who will act like  to you, but they're quite the minority from what I've seen.
Spodermen;-;classic FPS.
Yeah I'm Friendly;-;10/10 Fun, a big time waited fps from valve... Just buy it and pm me thanks! xdd
Mlynos ibuts;-;Russia/10 Learned native Russian in 1 week. Thanks matchmaking.  BLYAT.
Err;-;Old school Counter Strike revamped!!! CS has always been my true love when it comes to FPS games. It has a hard learning curve but pays off if you stick with it. With new maps & Skins being added, it has much more to offer than the previous versions of CS. In the words of the great FPS Doug "BOOM, HEADSHOT!"
Moist;-;Meet interesting people, and knife them when they fail to wear headphones. Every summer this is hands down the most fun you will experience making 12 year old children cry, without the risk of a restraining order. Listen to their pre-pubescent cries of "OMG H4X" as an endless series of small children who all claim to have slept with our mothers fail to understand that the AK-47 is perfectly accurate on the first shot, and that AWPs can kill through walls. 10/10 would make the children suffer again.
Touchmate-Kenan \_()_/;-;I simply cannot get enough of this game, once you get bored of something, there will always be else to play.
Myprey;-;Waste of time.
H3ADL3SS;-;One of my favorite games, I play it every day. One of the only FPS i like at the moment. It's really fair, if you die it's most likely your own fault and not by some cheap killstreak reward. Love the competitive matchmaking. It also has dedicated servers with most of the mods from Source. If you like CS it is a must buy. If you are not really good at shooters it can be fun to play arms race, deathmatch and other random custom gamemodes. Can be really hard to get into though, but the game has ranks that will match you with opponents with the same skill level. If you put some time on it you will improve quickly :)
.StrikeR [HMC];-;I like this game and I highly recommend it to others because im cool like that.
Lulas;-;This game is so addicting! It's got such a different engine compared to other FPS games, so it's really unique! I'd say this is the best teambased game out there. And nothing beats the adrenaline rush when in a clutch situation... Nothing.
Kakka Carrort Cake;-;Buy guns, Kill people, Die, wait for game to end, Do it over again. 10/10 Would recommend
Valor;-;By far best shooter i've played in a while! Would truly recommend this to anyone that likes fps games

The Soup Kitchen #GetFed;-;I love this game. I have an insane fetish for getting shot in the face. Other games just couldn't satisfy this urge but jesus thank you CS:GO, now I join lobbies with a player hitting me in the face with a 7.62mm from an AK-47 that joyfully squishes into my face and turns in into a pulp. Oh god yes. As I visualize the copper lead bounce around in my skull, I achieve an  unbeknowest by any man, women, or living being on this planet, then I take a shower and cry. Overall 10000000000/10, greap fap material.
pirate;-;Gameplay: 5/5 Matchmaking: 3/5 Mechanics: 4.5/5 Visual: 4/5 Optimization:5/5 My pc isn't horrible but horrible pc's can run this. CS:GO In a nutshell: Very good game like the other counter-strike series, and is my favorite amongst them all. The gameplay is great, mechanics are amazing aswell although there are some bugs here and there. Game is geared towards smooth FPS and gameplay rather then the graphics/visual but still looks very appealing. This game isn't pay to win in any aspect which makes it absolutely skilled based. You can spend some money on it to get weapon 'skins' which are 100% cosmetic and have no change on the game. As a matter of fact, some weapon skins just make the gun easier to see and can lead the player holding it at a disadvantage. However, there are some exclusive maps in operations that are sold in passes which cost money. Despite that, the original maps are still the best in my opinion. Only thing I dislike about CS:GO is the matchmaking system. Sometimes it makes sense and sometimes it doesn't. In CS:GO there is a 'Competitive' mode for getting ranked and playing 5v5 in classic mode style. You can either play as a premade team which is up to 5 players partied up and ready to play, or solo queue. Now don't get me wrong, solo queueing is risky in this game and doing it is very ballsy. You might get matched up with trolls, players out of your skill level (better or worse than you by ALOT). You should probably get a team or at least 3 friends to play with that can help you improve in the game. When playing competitive try not to invite friends that are simply friends and are not good at the game (trust me, they can lose you many games and possibly even get you demoted). Valve tries to keep you matched up with people around your skill level. If you had a silver 1 (lowest rank) and a global elite (highest rank)premade, they will likely be placed against Nova or Guardian ranks. (Averageish ranks). Game can be frustrating sometimes but remember. Teamwork is key. Getting a random solo queue team that you're playing with to follow your strats will practically win you the game. Yelling at your teammates or being toxic isn't going to help. If you don't feel comfortable or simply want to play the game for fun and not getting ranked, there is casual. Casual is basically where you can just have some fun :). If you want to get better, read guides on the internet and practice, practice and practice. Deathmatch is good for getting your aim down and community aim maps are good too. There are also community servers for multiple gamemodes. Note: While playing CS:GO you can get drops in the game. You can then sell them on the market and they can get you some small change which you could later spend on some cheap skins. If you're lucky you could get some crazy skins worth quite a bit but that's very unlikely. Yes, this does mean you can make profit and trade in this game!

Revan The Suicidal Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

Sutgon;-;*kills a chicken* *gets 1 point* *doesn't bother with players and only kills chicken*
Benjosaur;-;CSGO is decent for me, but im not like picky or anything
Lemur Licker;-;This game is lots of fun. It's not your typical run and gun CoD clone, however. CS:Go requires tactics, teamwork and lots of skill. I would recommend this game to anybody who likes to play first person shooters. It's worth every cent of the $15 price tag.

CrushKillDestroy;-;My original review was not too nice towards CSGO, but I've given it some time to get updated and whatnot and let me just say, it has improved greatly. It has become an excellent modern replacement to CSS. There are servers for all players, from noob to elite, and they're populated all day and night. Graphics options are top shelf and well optimized. Great job making CSGO what it should be Valve.

TheSpermThatWon #R.I.P. LEM;-;This is by far one of my favorite games of all time and in my opinion the pinnacle of first person shooters. Counter Strike has always achieved elegance with simplicity, the mechanics are seemingly simple but the learning curve is massive and incredibly extensive making this game addictive and enjoyable. Also, being made on the source engine, the game is very stable and well optimized in all aspects; Networking, GPU/CPU usage, etc.
Nyanmaru;-;Bring back a classic shooter and add in high definition graphics. The Counter Strike community just never dies!!
Tormady;-;Oh my god. I love and hate this game. Mostly love though, so satisfying getting a competitive win. So crushing getting a loss in competitive.

Lord Meow XVII;-;CS:GO, also know as Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a very competitive game with ranks placing you in a certain skill group. It is a 5v5 tactical first person shooter that involves counter-terrorists trying to prevent the terrorist from planting the bomb. The other game mode involves the terrorists trying to prevent the counter-terrorists from rescuing the hostages. With many weapons to buy every round with money that you have earned from the previous round, this game is very diverse. Although the game can be very stressful at times, It is a great game to have fun with friends. This game is by far, my most very favorite game ever!
woodmon122 aka The Ikan Bilis;-;I've played this game for only a little bit and have been enjoying it so far

FreekyBeast;-;Well i made an earlier review but it was not a justified one. Counter Strike Global Offensive has to be a different and refreshing alternative to the most popular FPS games such as Call Of Duty, and Battlefield. Keep in mind CoD has its Pros and Cons but to a experienced gamer in both FPS games and their change from Smaller Maps and Guns you unlock through leveling up through CoD to the Bigger Maps and same type of system in BattleField, these two gaming franchises have huge similarities but small differences, They both have their small and big maps, with different gamemodes. But the small differences with being able to use vehicles in Battlefield where you call in killstreaks to gain an advantage through a small period of time throughout the match. But when it comes to Counter Strike or any Valve game in particular, it is based on the knowhow and people skills, also the Teamwork aspect, unlike Call Of Duty and Battlefield where you could just *PWN THEN NOOBS* all by yourself and go Rambo, Valve games focus on Winning the game through Teamwork, which now adays is used to win games, in CoD you basically Point and Shoot, where you aim you fire, same with Battlefield, but when it comes to CS:GO you cant just go in guns blazing without controlling the recoil and bullet patterns. To me CoD and BattleField are Entertainment, but Counter Strike it is an art, a skill.
Wilhelmslo;-;Very good FPS !
Beesore, Number 1 Anal Bleach;-;Flashbangs and pistols cost the same. Also, you defuse a bomb with a good, old-fashioned death-stare, not with them hoity-toity wire cutters or codes. 10/10

I don't want to complain too much about the game, as I know many people I'm friends with do play it, but be honest, the community is terrible and there's a reason this game never got popular on consoles.
Matty;-;AWESOME GAME BUT  COMMUNITY!

Tio Patrico;-;Best game I've played so far, Matchmaking can be a bit unfair sometimes but that doesn't matter if you just become better each time :) At first it was hard to learn how the new system worked compared to CSS, but after times and times of playing I enjoy it more and more, also the fact that u can play matchmaking without going to a website like enemy down and ESEA is fantastic, cause now more people will play competitivly and will add more fun and mix to the game. Patrico out ;)

xJonathan;-;Best steam game ever. Best shooter ever. Best gameplay ever.
Frost;-;Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet. Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC. If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game, with the following special bits: PlayStation 3 For those who want to play on PlayStation 3 but dont want to deal with the imprecision of analog sticks, Counter-Strike: GO supports mouse and keyboard, giving it a pretty noticeable edge over the Xbox 360 version. If youre feeling saucy, Move is another option, although nuance dies with the motion controller. Move is accurate, and your quick reflexes will score kills, but the unavoidable instability of holding a remote will give your cursor some seriously unpleasant wobble. Worse, moving the wand quickly can confuse the controller, which often and irritatingly misinterprets basic left/right looks as a want to turn around 180 degrees. Xbox 360 Aside from the lack of keyboard/mouse input, the Xbox 360 version of Global Offensive is functionally identical to that on PS3 -- the new radial user-interface on both platforms is as elegant as it is on PC. Because its a hardcore competitive game, Counter-Strike blocks party chat in an effort to combat cheating, forcing players with headsets to play with friends or brave the Wild West of obscenity that is Xbox Live. THE VERDICT Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.

Nabe the Newb;-;The game is very strange to me The gameplay mechanics, the maps, the coordination, the matchmaking and the fun past times game modes.....all beautiful. But if because of the people who play it, the game takes the downfall. More and more, people hack and smurf and they are not letting the new begginer players even play the game and going 5 minutes without eating s*it. Valve of course wont be able to 100% fix this for because if they did, fair players would suffer too. So get yourself atleast a 3-man premade team b4 u start anything and pray that no-one bad i waiting for you on the other team. Just cause of the bad community its a 6/10

LIKE(AFK 6 MONTHS);-;This is a disappointing game. Not because of its game quality is not good, on the contrary it is very good. So that's why I take about 500 hours to play it with my friends. In fact,it has created numerous wonderful moment for me. I love this game very much. DUST2 is the best map in FPS GAMES. Thanks Valve for taking it to us. Its a Wonderful gift. But there are so many many many many many many many many many many countless hackers in it. It make me angry. Im sad. I have even become frenzied. I began to doubt everything and not serious to play the game. I couldn't feel a little pleasure in this game anymore.Maybe it's my fault. You can laugh at me for a noob. I won't deny. VAC is good,but useless. Hackers become more and more. I really lack of proof. But that it doesn't matter. Everyone can judge for yourself in this game. I advise those hackers, don't hurt the game, finally you will not find happiness in it. GG ,,,.,,.,,,XD

ShadowShuyin;-;Wow. This game is great. At first, you will get your  handed to you like a scrub. Unless you played Counter Strike and Counter Strike Source. In which case, you should be fine. This game can only be played well, with good internet. And you need to not rage. Trust me, its hard not to, but its way more fun to have fun. (Makes sense, right? XD) Anyways, this game is a money grabber, and can bag you dollars as well. With the case system, your chances of getting rare weapons are slim, but when you do get one, you feel amazing. (Espically that damn Butterfly Knife) I extremely recommend this game to anyone looking for an FPS. Even COD players could play this game. Granted that they know the game controls. And don't ask, "How does one aim down sights." Because you can't. Never. Bottom-line Good game. Buy it.

It will teach you how to aim, when to shoot, and how to be a team player. Without this game i would be a really bad sniper, and team leader. This is a MUST have game.

Oh god yes. As I visualize the copper lead bounce around in my skull, I achieve an  unbeknowest by any man, women, or living being on this planet, then I take a shower and cry.

pirate;-;Gameplay: 5/5 Matchmaking: 3/5 Mechanics: 4.5/5 Visual: 4/5 Optimization:5/5 My pc isn't horrible but horrible pc's can run this. CS:GO In a nutshell: Very good game like the other counter-strike series, and is my favorite amongst them all. The gameplay is great, mechanics are amazing aswell although there are some bugs here and there. Game is geared towards smooth FPS and gameplay rather then the graphics/visual but still looks very appealing. This game isn't pay to win in any aspect which makes it absolutely skilled based. You can spend some money on it to get weapon 'skins' which are 100% cosmetic and have no change on the game. As a matter of fact, some weapon skins just make the gun easier to see and can lead the player holding it at a disadvantage. However, there are some exclusive maps in operations that are sold in passes which cost money. Despite that, the original maps are still the best in my opinion. Only thing I dislike about CS:GO is the matchmaking system. Sometimes it makes sense and sometimes it doesn't. In CS:GO there is a 'Competitive' mode for getting ranked and playing 5v5 in classic mode style. You can either play as a premade team which is up to 5 players partied up and ready to play, or solo queue. Now don't get me wrong, solo queueing is risky in this game and doing it is very ballsy. You might get matched up with trolls, players out of your skill level (better or worse than you by ALOT). You should probably get a team or at least 3 friends to play with that can help you improve in the game. When playing competitive try not to invite friends that are simply friends and are not good at the game (trust me, they can lose you many games and possibly even get you demoted). Valve tries to keep you matched up with people around your skill level. If you had a silver 1 (lowest rank) and a global elite (highest rank)premade, they will likely be placed against Nova or Guardian ranks. (Averageish ranks). Game can be frustrating sometimes but remember. Teamwork is key. Getting a random solo queue team that you're playing with to follow your strats will practically win you the game. Yelling at your teammates or being toxic isn't going to help. If you don't feel comfortable or simply want to play the game for fun and not getting ranked, there is casual. Casual is basically where you can just have some fun :). If you want to get better, read guides on the internet and practice, practice and practice. Deathmatch is good for getting your aim down and community aim maps are good too. There are also community servers for multiple gamemodes. Note: While playing CS:GO you can get drops in the game. You can then sell them on the market and they can get you some small change which you could later spend on some cheap skins. If you're lucky you could get some crazy skins worth quite a bit but that's very unlikely. Yes, this does mean you can make profit and trade in this game!

NoMoreDeadCops;-;Truck driver Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) and his friend, restaurant owner Wang Chi (Dennis Dun), go to the airport to pick up Wang's fiancee Miao Yin (Suzee Pai), who is arriving from China. A Chinese street gang, the Lords of Death, kidnaps Miao Yin, intending to sell her as a sex slave. In Jack's big-rig truck, he and Wang track the Lords of Death to the back alleys of Chinatown, where they find a funeral procession that quickly erupts into a street fight between the Chang Sing and Wing Kong, two ancient Chinese societies. When "The Three Storms" (Thunder, Rain, and Lightning) appear, slaughtering the Chang Sing, Jack tries to escape but runs over Lo Pan (James Hong), a powerful and legendary sorcerer, as well as the leader of the Wing Kong. Horrified, Jack exits his truck, only to be blinded by Lo Pan, who is merely annoyed. Wang hurriedly guides Jack through the alleys, escaping the carnage and mayhem, but Jack's truck is stolen. Wang takes Jack to his restaurant, where they meet up with lawyer Gracie Law (Kim Cattrall), Wang's friend Eddie Lee (Donald Li), and magician Egg Shen (Victor Wong), a local authority on Lo Pan. They try to explain to an incredulous Jack some of the ancient knowledge and sorcery the Chinese brought with them to America, eventually devising a plan to infiltrate a brothel, where they think Miao Yin is being held. However, the Storms make off with Miao Yin, bringing her to a front owned by Lo Pan. Trying to rescue her, Jack and Wang are quickly subdued by Rain and taken to see Lo Pan, now in the form of a crippled, old man. Wang tells Jack that Lo Pan needs a special green-eyed girl to break an ancient curse, and he intends to sacrifice Miao Yin. When Jack and Wang's friends attempt to save them, they are also captured, and Lo Pan notes that Gracie has green eyes, too. Lo Pan decides to sacrifice Gracie, while making Miao Yin his unwilling wife. After getting the drop on Thunder, Jack and Wang escape, also freeing many women kept in holding cells. Wang and Jack go to see Egg Shen, and, with the help of the Chang Sing, they enter an underground cavern and reach Lo Pan's headquarters. Egg pours each of the group a potent potion that Jack says makes him feel "kind of invincible." During the wedding ceremony, a huge fight ensues, which Jack misses, due to accidentally knocking himself out. Wang kills Rain in a sword duel, while Jack and Gracie try to catch Lo Pan. Wang joins them, and, just when all seems lost, Jack kills Lo Pan, with a skillful knife throw. Thunder, enraged and dishonored at his failure to protect his master, starts to inflate to an enormous size, exploding and killing himself. Jack, Wang, Gracie, and Miao Yin are cornered by Lightning in a corridor, which he makes collapse. Egg rescues them with a rope and kills Lightning, when he tries to follow. After finding Jack's truck, they escape back to Wang's restaurant. Lo Pan having been defeated, the group celebrates in a warm and family-like way: Wang and Miao are obviously about to marry; Margo, Gracie's journalist friend, seems to be about to pair-up with Eddie; and Egg decides to go on a prolonged vacation, saying China is in the heart. Jack, instead of starting up a new life with Gracie, (as everyone was expecting up to that point), begs farewell to the group and hits the open road, with an unknown-to-him stowaway  one of the remaining monsters from Lo Pan's labyrinth.
Uncle Pen;-;Ruined my social life that did not exist
The UMPlectrician;-;Ever played one of those free-to-play shooters with cash shops? Behold, now you can pay $15 for another cash shop shooter! Now, don't get me wrong; the cash shop in this game does not give players an advantage over each other (thankfully). What cheeses me is the fact that we have to pay additional money if we want to enjoy other aspects of our game. I paid $15 for the game and now I need to pay extra for locked content? That's like selling someone a 12 pack of condoms for 15 bucks only to tell the user that they can only use 4 of them. They would have to pay extra for the rest of the condoms. It makes no logical sense - this business practise is plaguing the industry and I can't believe the developers bought into it. It's very disappointing. Now, about the game. It's nothing special, really. You've got your typical Counter-Strike with better graphics. The interface is also improved which is a plus. Gameplay hasn't changed much which is understandable but it's really nothing special. It's pretty much like every free-to-play shooter on the market nowadays. You're better off playing a game like Cross Fire or Ghost Recon Phantoms because it is very similar to those two. No singleplayer, just multiplayer with your default maps. You need to pay if you want more maps. Honestly, it's not worth your money. I'm not saying this out of spite, this is sheer honesty here. I thought I would get more bang for my buck but I was mistaken. 5/10 for me. This game is average.

Are you at the top of the leaderboards and die from one mistake/just die from bad luck? "God, you're so bad, it amazes me that you're at the top." Says the guy at the bottom. It's even more hilarious when you call them out on their hypocrisy, they either go into denial or even just ragequit. Or when a guy at the bottom with no kills 5 rounds in acts like he's a savant at CS:GO and tells everyone else how much they suck. And they will always try to blame hacks. Always. 10outta10. Never change. <3
//ad.Don;-;Global Offensive surprised me very positively. I only bought the game so I could join friends when they invite me again - but after playing a few rounds on the competitive gamemode, I really started to like it. Been of lot of fun since then, and I highly recommend it.
the real SaLaD of DERP;-;Gaben will steal all ur money 10/10
Dusk |Brawling|;-;If you're someone who enjoys fast paced, precision shooters, than you will love this game.
Morbid Fable CSGORage.com;-;Great game, classic shooter. Really strays from the "Modern Millitary Shooters" we have today. The community has a large ammount of veteran players that are often rude but the game has to go down in history as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time due to it's attention to detail. Where the bullet lands is an important role in this game and just because you get the jump on someone does not mean you're coming out alive.
CobraN;-;Fun game to play with friends. :)
FTW;-;Best game. I play it every day.
KingOfJewishDating;-;I ing hate this game. No other game has provided me with the upmost anger and irritation than this piece of . Alas I keep coming back for more due to some sick, masochistic spell this game casts over all who dare venture into its depths.

Sir Derp;-;I'm writing this review as im behind cover, surviving snipers,smgs and more. CSGO has led to me to a life of knives,guns,pain and glory but when the time comes....I will get that ace cozz i wanna b da vry bst liek nu 1 evr wuz 2 get a ace is meh real test to knife is mah caus Counter-strike! (I do not likepokemon what-so-ever but making jokes of its theme song is fun...right?) *Ahem* Well its 1v5 My team is saying "clutch or kick" but i cannot find my self to do the ace... So i close my eyes,pray to gaben and hope i get that ace then out of nowhere, I see a heavenly god Must be gaben his aura is made out of money made from steam sales and cs:go knife buys he drops down...gives me a senpai cannon then i soar into battle turning everyone into senpai and getting that ace 10/10 would bang again

Dunker#erbestur;-;love this game !
Onion;-;We have weapon skins, weapons tags, special super rare knives, cases, keys, StatTrak Weapons. Where are the hats ????
~Quinn~;-;Counter-Strike: Russian Invasion
Poisonarcher;-;best game i have ever played. just look at my hours
RowdyTigrs;-;A very interesting game, Alot of practice is needed to master the art of aiming and you probs wanna keep your wallet hidden away due to its tempting weapon options.
Yung Lean;-;I r8 this game 8/8,soooo much better then pajama sam.Play this game in a lake and you automatically win,thats how good it is
GNEKUWON;-;Very nice game.
BluBry;-;Bought this game, played about 50 hours, now can speak fluent russian, great banter in a brilliant package
Sub-Zero;-;It cool i like this game but I hate Coold ing Down! 7 Days! GOD DAMMIT!! I give 9/10 :P
Fred16;-;Tha is the game that allows you to have fun, play with new and old friends, find new friend, be happy, lose your friend because of the game, talk tactics, play as a team, get Ownd, get ace, get headshott and much more but don't forget it will give you those moment that you will never forget. I give this game a 10/10, for the grafics and how good the maps is!
Catnip;-;I once owned an expensive knife and AWP. That got me killed in competitive. 4 Times. 11/10 Would play with Russians again.
jacksparrowblackbeard;-;It has every basic element of original game with many more things. Graphics are very nice with no effect on performance. New maps and modes are well designed and fun to play. Overall forget old ones and play this.
Jacob;-;This game has kept me happy for the past 4 - 5 months , i love this game. I would def. recommend it
POkakkaOP;-;You'll get so addicted to the competive ladder system.
TheJerkoe;-;At first,I thought this game was sh!t. No aiming,no sprinting,and all that. After some time I decided to play it again with a friend,and now I love it :). You need to get used to the mechanics and when you do,you'll get lots of fun and hatred outta it. 11/10 *Posted from a COD player*
123123123123;-;what a game!! Epic
Templar19;-;Counter-Strike has always held a special place in my heart, so it may be hard to speak without bias. That being said, if you are looking for a competative First person shooter, this is your game. It is no call of duty where blood distorts your view, its no battlefield with explosions all around you, it is a highly refined competative first person shooter, the phrase "easy to learn, hard to master" could not apply anymore to this game, the controls are simple, the maps are easy to learn, but the tacticts, teamwork, recoil compensation, and economy are something that may take you years to master. The game has a huge competative scene with multiple tournaments with prize rewards in the hundreds of thousands every year. The difficulty of the game, and the rewarding feel of getting an AK-47 headshot are something that never go away, Highly recommend 10/10.
Scope Outlast;-;This game isn't really like COD, BF or even Arma. But, if you can learn how to play, this game might end up being your most played game.
JAR_Head1311;-;I love playing this game
(  Ace  );-;if your gonna to awp remember to keep calm and take time to aim properly :v if your gonna scout just remember jump snipe is effective ^^ if your gonna m4a1s just remember to hold down ur mouse and squat if your gonna ak47 just tap no really :> if your gonna compy...please learn to play / study the map before you join competitive ! :<
Lad;-;As expected from valve, a very well made and balanced game where being skilled rewards you. It has a side economy consisting of skins to your weapons and different knives that you use in combat. Gr8 game vovlo r8 8/8 m8
Vectivis;-;It's an alright game, havn't played it that much.... maybe a few hours.
SpatenRundung;-;+ Funny angry Russians + cooler knifes only costs about 400$ + Many Chickens
Twinkie;-;If you like competetive gameplay this game is for you If you like good physics this game is for you If you like to kill chickens this game is for you If you like to use P90s this game is not for you
SuFixT #Scammed;-;This is a ok for right now could be a lot better. Csgo has changed a lot. I first off enjoy the game because of the competiveness and the skill that is needed, but they are a few problems. Like hit dections and the rekt-9. The new meta of the game "run and gun" should not even be in the game. Lets say you have a guy who is good with an ak. He misses his headshot because the guy is running with a smg jumping around. In theory the guy with the ak should have killed him but no since the spread of bullets when running is like a circle the guy with an ak is died. That most often happens in the silvers. Also not to mention there are a bunch of cheaters in this game. I think valve really has to step up there game with the cheaters because they are a lot out there. They are ruining the game for people. Also the smurfs. I have found a solution for this. The reason why people smurf is because they dont want to play with cheaters. It is like a circle. If there is a cheater in the higher ranks the guy who is not cheating will want to buy a smurf so he doesnt play with cheaters. If valve steps up there game with cheaters then they wont be any smurfs. Now back with the "run and gun." The rekt-9 is the most over used gun in my opinion. You dont even have to aim for the head because you mostly are going to get a headshot with it. Also the most over used gun in the silvers is the p90. I dont see a lot of p90s. The reason why i hate it. It is because the moving spread of the p90. You also have 50 bullets. Basicly you and just spray with it. That is my review If there is a update of csgo with the meta change I will update my review.
w3n | Goint To Silver Elite;-;i love play this game, an awesome game
Skeng^;-;failing my a levels 420/420
JaVaZ;-;Ever since buying this game, I: -Have learned very fluent Russian and I'm getting 10s in my Russian class for just showing up -Had my internet and PC crash more times than I could count -Have never seen the sunlight since I bought it -Lost all of my friends -Spent almost $400 on virtual pixels -Have learned how many immature 12 year olds have ed my mother 10/10 I would recommend this game to every 3 year old who knows the words  and blyad
CoronaHypeZ;-;This Game is the best. 100/10 Would play it again. Its worth buying it. Go buy it
EngineRX;-;Really good game! CS:GO is really addicting , atleast for me. I love the skins you get and if you dont like them .. just sell them! :D This game is a really Skill-needed game and not like call of duty that everyone can be a pro. I'ts fun playing ! the ranks and comp matches... I recommend you buy it so you can feel how it is to play and not look at the pictures and say its crappy!
Dad;-;Awesome game if you're into FPS. Definately reccomend it.
Pam Poovey;-;Best game NA. Needs more Aztec tho.
InDogeWeTrust;-;very addicting and great

WksPatryk;-;worth to buy. Trust me
QBIXZ;-;One of the best pc games.
ghostie;-;this is a quality video game for your home personal computer
{LN} ~Jeck;-;A Great List of good things about this game. - Get Called A Hacker After A Killing Them - Have Expensive Knifes and if you have a low priced knife you will be called a noob but if you have a expensive one your good or used your moms credit card - you can get easily unlucky unless you play with friends who all have mics and understand the game Actual good things: - Team Cooperation - smart players who can rekt them all and will be with you all the way - helping you feel better when you get rekt - Cheap trading cards for badges - You can make enemies and very good friends. Some friends will just make you play better.
Sutgon;-;*kills a chicken* *gets 1 point* *doesn't bother with players and only kills chicken*
Paranoia;-;Very fun but needs skill and patience. Get some friends to play competitive since not all people in the community will be to your liking :)
Exision #3KYT;-;If you get ever matchmaked with the russians, open up your console and type "voice_enable 0" That really helps ranking up, or you can talk with the chickens... and not rank up.
tter;-;If you like CSS, I would reccomend getting CSGO. The game is a much fancier, nicer, and smoother version of CSS. The matchmaking in my opinion, is fairly well balanced. The only problems with the matchmaking is purely that people go into groups, with much higher stat guys which can sometimes make the game seem unfair. The UI is simpler, and nicer then CSS. My favorite aspect of the game, while sometimes looked down upon is the inventory system. Yes it has been called "TF2" for having skins, but they are purely cosmetic, and not only that they look absolutely amazing. I talk all the time about how I want that amazing skin, or how I actualyl preffer a gun just because of its skin! Their isn't a billion different guns (Where as hats ya know...) and most of them are obtainable without even spending a dime! StatTrack being my favorite, makes the game a lot more fun, will I get a new skin? Will i be able to sell the skin and save for a cheap game? Secondly I enjoy the simplicity of competitive. I never quite understood how to do comp in CSS, and always played DM or another type of gamemode, CSGO makes it easy! Select competitive! Or, want a different gamemode? Just select it and wait! While waiting doesn't sound the greatest, it is very nice, get a snack, talk, plan, etc. Gives time to think through, and get friends! I rate this game an 8/10 and would deffinetaly get it!
Road2Nova1;-;Gaben is god of everyone
Chuckie;-;Nice game for Source lovers !!!! 10/10
Adrig6;-;100% Recommended!
Ryugarr;-;This game is for real gamers. Not for those dirty dorito finger stained console peasants. Accept the light of our lord and savior GabeN and give him all your damn money!
infernojo3117;-;rurined my life. 10/10
f e r a;-;I can say with 400hrs of game time this is definatly a game to pick up. If you are not into FPS it may not be a game your looking for although you can get minigames as such but i wouldnt pick it up if you dont like FPS. Moving on if you do like fps this game is a definate game for you, it has casual for people who just want to chill and play some fps and then competitive for 5v5 bomb mission or hostage rescue. This concludes 30 rounds and first team to win 16 rounds wins.
Papi;-;A game where if you lose a 4v1 it's entirely your fault. A game where if you win a 4v1 you're a 'hacker noob'. A game where if you don't headshot someone you're a . A game where if you do headshot someone you're a lucker. A game where you get killed through smoke you're an idiot. A game where if you kill someone through smoke you're a waller. A game I've been consumed by - despite my below average skill. 8/10 - Mute everyone until you reach MG or greater.
goomy;-;do you enjoy shooting heads? spanish speaking teammates? hours and hours of frustration and 64 tick servers? if so buy this game
Arsaca;-;Typical day in CSGO competitive: -Rush B! -  ! 10/10
Mike;-;Your life is meaningless if you dont own this game. You will have no friends if you dont own this game. Your family will all bleed to death if you dont own this game. Buy your copy today!
IrrelevantDirection;-;10/10 would bang again, put a crap ton of money into it like on an insane level and lost most of it to betting. Cry every time. But still fun to spend all your life trying to rank up.
Nabe the Newb;-;The game is very strange to me The gameplay mechanics, the maps, the coordination, the matchmaking and the fun past times game modes.....all beautiful. But if because of the people who play it, the game takes the downfall. More and more, people hack and smurf and they are not letting the new begginer players even play the game and going 5 minutes without eating s*it. Valve of course wont be able to 100% fix this for because if they did, fair players would suffer too. So get yourself atleast a 3-man premade team b4 u start anything and pray that no-one bad i waiting for you on the other team. Just cause of the bad community its a 6/10
Karsheee;-;An outstanding representation of this generation's advancements in technology; the way bullets simply phase through opponents on state-of-the-art, high performance servers is breathtaking.

TheSpermThatWon #R.I.P. LEM;-;This is by far one of my favorite games of all time and in my opinion the pinnacle of first person shooters. Counter Strike has always achieved elegance with simplicity, the mechanics are seemingly simple but the learning curve is massive and incredibly extensive making this game addictive and enjoyable. Also, being made on the source engine, the game is very stable and well optimized in all aspects; Networking, GPU/CPU usage, etc.
stormfire.at^PimP Eastwood^;-;epic game - cs is still fun - like in the old days with 1.6 but it looks better :)
[DTF2] Danct12;-;First time plays it. Trying to sniping at ememy, look behind. A ememy is behind me. Got jumpscare. 11/10 - would jump again.
.Meksoo;-;Best way to learn russian Best way to improve ur trading skills Best game to learn aiming Best game to break your headphones, numeric parts of your keyboard Best way to being hate on russians, and kiddos ...Not for being racist just....they are very impressive
Serious;-;Counter strike. want a game where you can't actually play with people at your skill level.... because that would make it enjoyable..... NO NO NO you get little children buying as many game keys as possible just to take the easy shots and easy wins so they dont have to face someone near their skill level...... so if you like being bent over and ed with gabes vitual ...... get amongst this game...... you will love it.... get ed by awps....... m4's.... ak's....... you name the gun...... and valve will apply lube to that barrel and just go to town. 1000+ hours ive burned into this game since it came out..... all to get hacked by some kid who can't handle using game sense. good game ruined by hacks and micro transactions..... well done valve. well done.
Boogs;-;This is a very fun game
Painkiller;-;I am not a great fan of PFS Online. CS: GO is my total exception especially because it's my money grabber that feeds my steam wallet with some euros, enough in time to buy games in special deals. Still, you will find the community in this game to be erratic. You'll find nice people in one side and complete  bags in the other, that think they're the best players in the game just for you to find out they're trolling you and cheating hard. If you don't have the stomach consider yourself warned! Play this for fun and be nice to people, if you do that the matches tend to be a wonderful experience and better according to the team's mood, believe me!
[FTWN]Ftwdude9;-;Its very fun with an perfect way of Unboxing and getting items gameplay is awesome one of the best i found
The Anal Avenger;-;Cunter Stroke: Global Uhfensiv is a strategy oriented moba with mmorpgfps69danknoscop elements. Easy to get used to, and fun for the whole family. Akin to levels of greatness of games such as Silent Hill 2 and Shadow of the Colossus, Coochie Stank: GO has a plethora of interesting features, such as being called a  by children who have not yet learned how to multiply double-digit numbers, being called a  by grown men with jobs and lives (probably not), or using teamwork and strategy to achieve victory in a fast-paced competetive battle of the wits...........NOT. oris Stark: Globular Osprey has a friendly, and intellegent community that will make you feel right at home. I cant tell you how many times my life and my my mothers viginity has been put to risk by the kind and noble souls down at Cordoray Skunk: Giblet Oxtesticle. So come on down, buy a copy! Or why not two or three copies? Everyone else is doing it? So  it! Make sure to buy a  ton of keys so we can have the financial support to make ier variations of well loved maps too! 69/420 would bang.
Phoenaw;-;If this game was a booger, I would pick it first.
RickTheKing;-;Russian Class Simulator 2015
Lord Half Dead;-;good game better then call of duty
MLG Pingu;-;This Game is just simply awesome. Yes, I know the game is very hard but it's worth it you might be at the spectator screen all the time but the game is worth it. The only con is there are too many pro's but in every game there are pro's and noobs like you lol. So to sum it up this game is a very good game and it will always be like that. Great Chicken Simulator 1000/1000
rollerch1p /J/;-;This game is horrible. RUSSIANS PLEASE UNINSTALL THIS GAME. Thx GabeN <3<3
EmperorFishStick;-;So is this game good? Yeah xD Yeah i love this game i'll admit i'm addicted but that's the love of CS:GO you may play the same maps all the time but isn't every other FPS like that. Also buying/winning content is so amazing

Cuddle_Dickins;-;this game is really fun to play alone or with friends, but it's kind of annoying how you can't open any boxes so it's almost impossible to get skins on you're gun, but it's still a really good game 8/10
Tuts csg0.com;-;This game was cool untill I went to competitive mode.After playing this game you will know all russian swear words. Full of Russians who wont communicate with you and only yell suka suka idi nahhui etc. You cant get out of Silver once you get in there.There are lots of guys who are smurfs,specially when the sale is on.There are lots of guys who have only 16hrs of cs or even 10hrs - Most guys dont have sound/dont know how to sound,always going to wrong plant when bomb is planted,dont understand anything about this game and wonders how enemy is knifing him from behind,calling everyone who kills them hackers and then attacking teammates because they want to get kicked. I find this game fun until you have great team who are trying to win the game not give up on after losing first round. 1 annyoing thing is that when you go duo rank with someone you will always get guys who are unranked or dont understand anything about this game in your team and enemy team has 4 premade (even with clantag) or just very good players. IMO(In My Opinion) Counter Strike should make something like this- If you have under 50hrs total of csgo you cant go competitive mode If you have under 20hrs of actually playing in game vs real enemys you cant go to competitive mode I love this game but I hate the matchmaking system,Im still going to recommend this game because you can actually sometimes laugh how your teammates who are very bad are playing.

xJonathan;-;Best steam game ever. Best shooter ever. Best gameplay ever.
Frost;-;Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet. Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC. If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game, with the following special bits: PlayStation 3 For those who want to play on PlayStation 3 but dont want to deal with the imprecision of analog sticks, Counter-Strike: GO supports mouse and keyboard, giving it a pretty noticeable edge over the Xbox 360 version. If youre feeling saucy, Move is another option, although nuance dies with the motion controller. Move is accurate, and your quick reflexes will score kills, but the unavoidable instability of holding a remote will give your cursor some seriously unpleasant wobble. Worse, moving the wand quickly can confuse the controller, which often and irritatingly misinterprets basic left/right looks as a want to turn around 180 degrees. Xbox 360 Aside from the lack of keyboard/mouse input, the Xbox 360 version of Global Offensive is functionally identical to that on PS3 -- the new radial user-interface on both platforms is as elegant as it is on PC. Because its a hardcore competitive game, Counter-Strike blocks party chat in an effort to combat cheating, forcing players with headsets to play with friends or brave the Wild West of obscenity that is Xbox Live. THE VERDICT Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.
WESLEY ROLUDO;-;perfect game! rec

Jomos;-;One of most beautiful games of our time. The heart-wrenching, emmy-nominated story of a goat who wants to have more to life than just eating people and pooping watermellons. He'll go through the necessary struggle of making gas stations blow up, shooting people with a ball launcher, and flying. It's a truely remarkable story, and it will stick with me forever.

WolfEyes (Loki'd);-;This game ruined my steam wallet. 10/10
TigerAW;-;Yes, Good game.
Pippin;-;REALLY good game you got here. How there's actually recoil and armour makes it so much more fun.... However, the summer sale of 2014 brought in so many wall and aim hackers. This ruins the game for everyone else playing it. So to put it in perspective "YA'LL JUST GOT HAXOORED
"Tear";-;This game is just awesome! it's really competitive,balanced,developers take care of it,you find cheaters really rarely,you have more fun without hacks,i recommend it! and it doesn't cost a lot! it also has an awesome community,a lot of mods and modded servers with different original or non-original games like hide & seek,zombie escape,deathrun etc. but still cool and fun,nice skins for your weapons which you can win with casual weekly drops,peace on the earth. :)
Black100;-;BUY IT !!! .......... NOW !!!!!
Matt79;-;one of the best game's on steam
TheChunko;-;As a recent master race convert, I have no words to describe how irrtated I am at myself for never owning a Counter Strike game before. Wow, no FPS can currently touch this in terms of the playing field and skill based competition. You are getting owned by someone? They are better than you. You keep getting killed in the same places? Stop going there or shoot better. Use your brain, clutch like a king and ensure you have a headset. A superb competitive game. Thanks Valve
blev;-;To anyone coming from CoD and thinking they can dominate in Counter Strike like you can in CoD, you're sorely mistaken. This game has a much higher skill level, and is extremely difficult at first. However, its so rewarding when you can finally pull off the headshot in only one bullet like everyone else. Buy this game if you want to see how the first multiplayer FPS has evolved.
Splinker;-;Very addicting, always fun to play.
j profil /id/IRIS1337;-;Competitive: Recommended if you like russians, and people screaming at you for not being a CSGO Master. Never played the others, who does?

The graphics are OK for a game that was pretty recent and maps created by the community are also playable. If you're aspiring for an competitive environment this is the place for you!
Lucblast;-;This game is a very fun game to play, has skins , cases to open (which might empty your wallet). You get profit from this game also,while having fun you get case/skins drop you can sell and get other games you want!

nrwgn;-;I love this game. It always reminds me of when the time I spent in Spain during the spring of 1973. My grand daughter had just graduated from college and to celebrate, I took her to Spain. We had an excellent time but the food was not to my liking.
Evangelion[02];-;Game is good. Physics are strange but the general appearance of the show is relatevely good.
SmyrfY;-;A game that requires precise aim and strategy! Certain consequences will follow if you do not follow the code of conduct! Good luck & have fun! SEE YOU ON DUST2!
Team Nipple Rubs : Envra;-;Great game! This game is very fun but if you are a fan of cod this is a very different sort of fps. With this fps there is no zooming in unless the gun you have has a special sight. There are very kind people on it and you can make so green with the crates too. Very addictive but when you are not in the mood it is very boring. With this game instead of earning weapons with levels like most FPS do this you earn money every round and you spend that on your weapons. Great maps though some can get very boring because it is over chosen *cough cough* Dust II. I would say the only downside is you need to be online, there is no single player mode. Overall great game, great price, can make a fair amount of money through it, and is very addictive.

ColdJuice;-;Super fun game. I payed 7 dollars for it and made that money back in a couple days. Love it!
Mvrick;-;This game.. What can you say about it? Is Coubter Strike one of the best games of all time? In my opinion, absolutely! By far the best FPS shooter there ever was! I have played many games. Many of which were FPS shooters. The classic 007 Golden eye for the N64, the original Doom, Quake and so fourth. All great games! Counter strike brings something different. It's all player vs player. Just your team vs the other team. Tactics, movement, angles, reaction, mind games, strategy, teamwork, communication, economy, weapon recoil, smokes, flashes and nades and more all have an emence amount of importance in this game. If some ONE fails to take into consideration all of that, it can cost your team the round. It's a game that can be played fast. It's a game that can be played slow. Always having to think of what the other team might be doing. You have to figure out your enemy as soon as possible so you can hold the right angles, play better positions, change it up. But it has to work or it's for nothing. When it does.. knowing you outsmarted or at least figured your enemy out for "one round" as you watched them fall apart as a team is so rewarding. And thats just one round. More if you are lucky. no match is the same. Your skill is tested every time you jump into one. You might have to clutch some rounds for your team. the pressure is on. You pause a moment in mid doors to collect yourself before you try and retake B site 1v3. Your heart will skip a beat or two. There will be times you are shaking as you want so badly to clutch for yourself and your team. And when you do... There is no greater feeling in any game. Your team will congradulate you and maybe cheer. You will be shaking but smiling(maybe a fist pump). You just used all of the above in a few seconds time to win the round for your team and possibly save the match. This is the game I will always come back to. This is the game I will never stop playing as long as people play it... Get this game.
rmpz ___>;-;gg mg very izi only 83 wins and mg gg izi game
iPizza;-;First of all,i would like to start that i have enjoyed the game itself(gameplay,mechanics and overall expirience) But the thing that got me...The thing that ing got me..The bloody Matchmaking.It's fun as hell with friends but the cooldown system(Temporary ban) is ridiculously idiotic,stupid and just simply moronic.I got banned 3 times and for a justified reason which is friendly fire,1st ban is 30 Minutes(for friendly fire),2nd ban is 2 hours(friendly fire),3rd ban is 24 hours(friendly fire)And the last ban was for 7 days and what was the reason i was banned?For kicking to many players.You see there is a vote in competative that you can kick idiotic players,trolls,AFKers etc.And you dont even have to start a vote,you can simply agree to one and it counts(i only started 1 or 2 and agreed to the others,didn't start them) If you start a vote - it counts it If you agree to a vote - it counts it There is no warning about this idiotic thing,getting banned for 7 days for agreeting to votes?Like,notify players that this is a thing you can get banned!Am i supposed to know? Valve are you serious?This needs to get fixed ASAP.I cannot express how frustrated i am. I like the game itself and i would have reccomended you to buy it but the the matchmaking is just stupid.
Lanayru <Allen&Heath>;-;can't play as DPRK wtf is this
Deborah Morgan;-;I think that the Cooldown system is the most RIDICULOUS game add on I have ever heard of. I got kicked from a competitive match for an hour and a half because I shot a teammate who got in front of me. This is completely insane and an absolute waste of time. Not to mention the ranking system is bullcrap. At least in Source you picked your own scrims and knew if people were "smurfing". If I wanted to play Call of Duty on the computer I would have asked for a call of duty game.

You're welcome
Thibo;-;One of the best games, combination of tactics, skills and luck
TotallyNotKev;-;Coming from CS1.6, this game is an amazing step up from the last. Simply a fun and competitive game! Lives up the old expectations of any FPS gamer. All I could wish for is a less trashy community; but I guess that could be said for any game. And the skins. The skins... are a copy of TF2's market; either the skin is extremely expensive, or worth nothing. But aside, the gameplay is nearly perfect.

You guys should try it"... Well I stopped playing Counter-Strike because I felt like moving on you know, but after hearing those kids... I kinda felt like.. Never old to bring back some good memories. Now I play this game about 20-30 hours a week and I love it. You're never too old for this game. Never.

GucciLoui;-;I do recommend this game, but I only have one problem which is the Temp. Cooldown. The problem with the Temp. Cooldown is that when I was in a match with one of my friends on competitive he decided to teamkill and our team kicked him and even me, so when I returned to the main menu I noticed that I had to wait 7 days until my next Competitive match and my friend that was team killing got a Temp. Cool down for 24 hours... #FixTheCoolDown
Force Like Obi;-;It sure pisses you off, but that's a good sign. The game is awesome.
Cheese;-;This is a game
TwistedMF;-;10/10 would do it for mother russia again
Tunak Tunak Tun;-;I'm not one for first person shooters but this is awesome. CS:GO is much a game of skill as it is teamwork. You are playing as either Terrorists or Counter-Terrorists with a wide range of weaponry avaliable to both sides. The maps are diverse and the game-modes extremely enjoyable and fun. If this review isn't selling the game enough check out www.youtube.com/ImAnderZEL and watch some of his vids. Also I've racked up over 30 hours within 2 weeks of buying the game, thats how much I love it.
Kitsune;-;Great game, really enjoy it.
Picks 'n' Kicks (Terrum);-;One of the best of the CS series. Sure the first CS is the leader of them all, but CS:GO just puts the series onto a whole new level. It proves that Source can give amazing graphics as well as incredible gameplay, and it shows that CS will never die out. I think this is an amazing release made by VALVe and it's worth every penny. EDIT: Oh and to add, this review was made before release date of CS:GO - this is to prove to the people who don't believe me when I say I was in the CS:GO closed beta.
ANUS VINCERE;-;It's ok. Do not buy keys. Never. Ever.
Mewn;-;How could one stray away from the a game series that revolutionized the FPS genre? It isn't very different than any variation of CS. However, updated weapons, maps, gear and graphics make the game a lot more diverse that its predecessor. The gameplay is beautiful and the animations are great. The multiplayer keeps you coming back for more with its numerous different game-modes. Not to mention it's just as fun offline. In my personal opinion I would give the game a 8.5/10. I hope this reveiw was helpful to all of you reading.
SMM;-;Easier to play than other counter strikes, more weapons, better graphics... BEST Counter Strike title to date
[Fnatic] Pronax;-;Readlly Fun. Best Game I ever Played :P xD
jericho;-;your typical point and click game for kids, you can also play it to recieve some nerf gun skins and sell it to other kids for REAL money!
Very Strong Fighter;-;This game is like 1.6 and Source with balanced sprays, valve servers and pretty good matchmaking. Play this if you have nothing to do in your life anymor because you can't master this easily.
Vang Lion #RoadToMG;-;Yes, I recommend this game because... -You find skins -Fun -Has great graphics
f0rest;-;Very good game, reccomended :D
Sk4tt <Minim0E>;-;Really foon
Foxeh;-;A great cross between 1.6 and CSS, with constant updates from VALVe and the in built Match Making, this has the potential to be the FPS of choice for 2014 on PC. Forget CoD and BF, its time for a CS uprising.
Blistering Barnacles!;-;It's the most advanced 'remake' of the all time favourite massively multiplayer FPS game Counter Strike. The gameplays are fairly imrpoved, some character animations are added. All the previous maps have been given a graphical facelift. Users can play in diferrent gaming modes. The 'Competitive' mode is even more challenging. It provides you with a rank based on your skills. You can buy skins for your weapons from the workshop. Afterall this game is an old wine in a new bottle. It's not a sequel, it's an updated version of the previous CS. Updates are not bad though. It's a revamped way to utilize the magic of CS.
Pei Shi;-;This is one of the best FPS i have played. It is AWESOME <3
Hassel;-;very good game! :csgostar:
Cob;-;I mostly love this game because of the new COMPETITIVE mode. If you want to know more about it, read the first paragraph. If you want to know about every other game modes, read the whole review :). With the Competitive game mode, Counter Strike became one of the most interesting, intensive and thrilling FPS game. Competitive game mode is about to play 5v5 matches with your team where you need tactics, skills and knowledge of the game, maps and spots. There are a maximum of 30 rounds / competitive game. The team that wins 16 rounds will Win the whole match. If your team wins, members of the team climb up on a virtual ladder. Winning more and more matches may get you better ranks by the time and with ranks of course, harder enemies in the future matches. When you are playing Competitive mode, every step, move and shot matters. A fault can easily loose you a round out of the 30 or a better shot or lucky move can get a win for you and your team. Even it makes pressure on you to prove your skills, you have to stay calm to be able to do your best! Play it with friends, make a clan, and create one of the best team or just solo queue for the matches you will enjoy the game (except when you get bad team mates with zero tactics). The second new game mode is Arms Race. Still you can select what team you are in, but it isn't really matter. There are Arms Race specialized maps (unfortunately only a few) where you start with an SMG and every kill brings you a new weapon. You have to be the fastest to fight yourself through every weapon and get a kill with every one of them. The last one is a knife (golden knife in this game mode). If you manage to get the kill with the knife before anyone else you win the match. This game mode is fast-paced and excellent for some fun, and stress beating. The 3rd one is the Demolition mode. You can play the classic game on smaller maps with only one bomb site combined with the element of Arms Race what means every round you get frag makes you jump on the next weapon in the next round. Ofc there is the old game mode, called CASUAL where you play the classic maps with huge teams and there is a DM where you can select what weapon you want to play and then go and kill the enemy team members until the time goes down and the round ends. I recommend this game for every FPS player. You can play DM or Arms Race if you want some brainless shooting, Casual or Demolition for short time playing/casual play ofc, or Competitive if you have more time to play and not scared for some team work, thinking and ranking ;).
JohnPinto;-;A very tactical game that offers a good experience for playing with friends and making friends all around the world. By far one of the best FPS that I ever played.
J00ker;-;Quite a fun game, has it's ups and downs but I think it's more of a good game than a bad game. First of all, the game is very tactical and is filled with alot of different ways to play, but the most important part in the game is TEAMWORK. The game is best played when you have a couple of friends with microphones. The Competitive System in the game is quite fun. Matchmaking isn't terrible, no netcode problems, and really I have nothing bad to say except for the community. The Community of the game isn't harsh, but sometimes you may meet with some people which will be a little "y" throughout the game and may ruin your whole multiplayer experience. Overall, the game is wonderful and amazing, I personally enjoy it and recommend it to those FPS game lovers, THOUGH BE WARY that the aim in this game is nowhere like any other game, you don't have recoil but the ammount of bullet spray may get a little too much when you spray you gun rather than burst firing. Brilliant Game, Great Competition, Tactical Online Experience.
HaremKing Huiyi;-;A really nice FPS for a good price.
Aedir;-;What to write as a review for this game... Well, I started playing cs:go just a few days ago with my bf and so far I have been called: f'ing idiot, r3tard and they even unsuccessfuly tried to kick me out of the server lol I never knew that only macho guys with tiny d!cks played this game >.< They all seem to think they are pros, even though, they know, for a fact, they're playing with/against noobs who are trying to learn and improve. Oh and did I mention they sure as hell can't play with girls?! What a bunch of cavemen m0rons. So yeah, I hope you find this helpful.
1Maki-chan;-;Great community. I get called a  and people say I'm salty every 5 seconds. <3 10/10
Silver;-;It's an okay game I guess, but the only thing that really keeps you engaged is the extremly toxic community. They will yell at you for absolutely everything, and it's hilarious. You got 4 kills but couldn't pull off that 5th to ace the enemy team as the last guy? "Wow, you REALLY suck at this! Even /I/ could have done that!" Says the dead guy. Are you at the top of the leaderboards and die from one mistake/just die from bad luck? "God, you're so bad, it amazes me that you're at the top." Says the guy at the bottom. It's even more hilarious when you call them out on their hypocrisy, they either go into denial or even just ragequit. Or when a guy at the bottom with no kills 5 rounds in acts like he's a savant at CS:GO and tells everyone else how much they suck. And they will always try to blame hacks. Always. 10outta10. Never change. <3
//ad.Don;-;Global Offensive surprised me very positively. I only bought the game so I could join friends when they invite me again - but after playing a few rounds on the competitive gamemode, I really started to like it. Been of lot of fun since then, and I highly recommend it.

Morbid Fable CSGORage.com;-;Great game, classic shooter. Really strays from the "Modern Millitary Shooters" we have today. The community has a large ammount of veteran players that are often rude but the game has to go down in history as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time due to it's attention to detail. Where the bullet lands is an important role in this game and just because you get the jump on someone does not mean you're coming out alive.

Juicy;-;I stood on the bathroom counter, naked, with my back to the mirror, my hands spreading my  cheeks so far open my  actually felt strained. My legs held a wide stance, as I peered between them with my head between my knees, staring in awe at the upside-down reflection of my beautiful -winker. It was red, wrinkled, and seemingly limitless in depth. A few stray dingleberries were clinging to my long anal-pubes, a result of inadequate wiping. I loosened the grip of my right  cheek, freeing one hand, then using it to circle the rim of my  with my index finger in a somewhat tickling fashion. My  flexed from the sudden and titillative sensation, involuntary retracting in an almost winking gesture. I giggled, then farted. Expecting to see some kind of cartoon-like green fumes or brown bubble, but instead just watching my little pucker momentarily expand then reseal, returning to it's natural form. "You're amazing," I whispered. My wife sat on the nearby toilet, sobbing with her head in her hands. The recent infatuation with my own sphincter was putting a strain on our relationship, one that admittedly wasn't going to be quickly remedied by any form therapy. This was pure love, not just some cheap form of fleeting lust or passing human desire. This was a burning, deep, enchanting devotion from the soul. My  was the most beautiful thing I've ever encountered. My wife realized this, and couldn't cope with her recent feelings of worthlessness. Anything we once had was gone - my divine sphincter taking its place. "I remember when you used to talk me like that," she sobbed. "Look at me like that." I slowly inserted my index finger inside of my gorgeous turd canal, moaning as my  began to stiffen,  residue staining my penetrating digit. My breathing intensified, as my body clenched with ic delight - a perversion so divine. "How can you flaunt your mistress in front of me like this, gratify yourself like this? How?" she cried desperately. Her voice cracked as her fading beauty-now meaningless to me-seemed to die a little more. She meant nothing to me. My bewitching brown oval consuming my soul with a desire like no other. Lusting for just one kiss with my poop-chute, I pulled my finger from my , tasting it with sensual delight. The sour, pungent taste of fecal matter brought my  to a complete and raging hard-on - pulsating with every excited heartbeat. Smacking my lips, I savored the grotesque turd juice, as if sampling a fine wine. The pre- now dripping with erotic anticipation from my pounding ramrod. "Hold my -cheeks open while I jack off," I ordered my wife. "I want to see my  when I ." "No! I won't do it!" she screamed in complete distress, the hurt in her voice matching the desperate tears streaming down her face. "This isn't right! It's not ing right! I'm your wife!" Ignoring her, I reinserted my index finger up my pooper, while furiously masturbating with my other hand. Angels sang as I began building toward , moans of enchanting ecstasy echoing off the bathroom walls. My eyes crossed as I screamed with absolute pleasure, I was close, so ing close. "Stop it! Stop it!" my wife pleaded. My strokes became more defined, faster, harder. I cried out in desperation. Almost there... "Jesus! ing stop it! This is our home! Ours!" she cried. "How can you...?" A tremendous warmth filled me, as my  spit white gravy in immense, systematic spurts. I continued fingering my , stimulating my prostrate, enhancing the sexual euphoria, as my steaming  shot thick man juice across the bathroom, clinging in long, mucilaginous strands to the wall. My vision blurred, feeling the full force of the powerful quake. The light faded as I fell into world of unconsciousness, basking in the comfort of my newfound love, and the endless pleasure of an absolute anal infatuation.

Global Offensive keeps the same style with improved mechanics,graphics,match-making and much more! It is the best competitive FPS youre gonna find ever on the market. Forget CoDs or Battlefields or Titans,from this you learn to aim and to take defeat as an answer(it gets frustating at soo many times). Global Offensive is purely based on one's skills. There are no power ups, no special items, only your skill makes the difference. It has a wide collection of weapons and awesome skins. Gameplay is full of action and just amazingly addictive!! CS:GO is love. CS:GO is life!! Very very super competitive. Great fun. Highly recommended!

The Domestic Dog;-;Rugby union fans have been starved for authentic video game representations of their beloved sport for years now, with the last truly strong rugby game being Rugby 08. Sadly, Rugby 15 is not the game to break the drought. In fact, its an utter disaster. Of all the various sports that share the football classification, rugby union is one of the trickiest for newcomers to wrap their heads around thanks to a myriad of rules and complexities. While scoring points is the same logic as other forms of footballgetting a ball across a try line or kicking a ball between goal postsconverting kick-off to try time involves a number of key set pieces.The team in possession of the ball can run as many phases as they like, unless theres an infringement or they kick the ball. When tackled, the player holding the ball must release it, as players from both sides pile in and form a ruck, which can only be entered from the side. Scrums and mauls can be used to drive the ball across the try line or gain precious metres, while line-out kicks are essential for gaining ground. In short, rugby union is a tricky game to learn, and developer HB Studios deserves kudos for condensing the complexities of the game into a relatively simple arcade-style control scheme. Unfortunately, for gamers hoping Rugby 15 will be the gateway to understanding union, theres a lack of a meaningful tutorial, or any specific training modes for the various components of the sport. Instead, youll have to learn by way of ten static training screens and in-game control reminders. For the most part, the controls are all very easy to come to grips with, but it almost instantly comes apart after kick-off. As I played, it became increasingly clear to me that the gameplay stops and starts based on what the player is doing. While its nice to be at the centre of the action, it makes for boring rugby, as both sides stand around waiting for you to act. For instance, at kick-off, your AI teammates only start moving after youve fully completed the drop-kick start of play, and the kicker stands stuck on the spot for a second or two before being able to move. Even if you switch players immediately after kicking, its impossible to perform cheeky ten-metre starts/restarts that give you the opportunity to gain possession and make easy ground.Similarly, there were times when I pulled the ball out of the back of a ruck and just stood there watching the opposing team stand around, oblivious to my possession until I took a step forward. The best tactics were to deliberately relinquish possession to gain easy metres. I found the most successful and repeatable tactic, regardless of difficulty level, was to perform a box-kick from the back of a ruck to gain ground. As long as the kick stayed on the field and outside of the 22-metre line (where the AI will take a mark), its incredibly easy to force a turnover.Basic tackling is as easy as guiding your selected player into the opposing player with the ball. Or any opposing player for that matter, as you never seem to get penalised for tackling players that arent carrying the ball. In fact, outside of ruck infringements, I rarely got penalised for anything. Forward passes were never noticed or penalised, whether performed by me or the opposing team, and off-side penalties were only awarded about ten percent of the time. As for ruck penalties, theyre incredibly easy to avoid. Once the player carrying the ball is tackled, you have to push the right stick into a predetermined sweet spot that rushes from red to yellow to green, then you can take possession of the ball. Attempting to take the ball when the meter is red results in an instant penalty; yellow is a risky grab that may result in a penalty (and is, surprisingly, easier to get away with in hard difficulty); while green is safe to grab, except when the referee erroneously pings you from time to time for a legal grab. The ruck mechanic is glitchy when in possession of the ball, meaning I had to hit the right trigger to release the ball before attempting to play the meter game. If I didnt do this, Rugby 15 stopped registering controller input for a few precious seconds. This is a problem that plagues that PlayStation 3 version of the game more than anything else (also outside of rucks). Given the specific way youre forced to ruck, its best not to be in possession of the ball until youre within ten metres of the try line, so you dont have to deal with the incredible frustration of losing possession because the game bugs out. Even on the supposedly hard difficulty, its incredibly easy to win back possession in a ruck once you learn the right-stick sweet spot and perfect timing combination. By far the biggest problem I had with Rugby 15, though, was that it rarely felt as though skill or tactics played into scoring tries. When running with the ball, you can flick the right stick up or down, or twirl the stick around completely, to sidestep opponents, but even that mechanic only seemed to work sporadically for me. The game seems to predetermine the outcome of specific plays before the animation occurs, resulting in an inability to pass the ball if it decides youre about to be tackled, or a lack of a sidestep if that stationary player in front of your guy is destined to take you down. Similarly, partial AI control over the player-controlled footballer means that sidesteps and fends automatically occur at the games discretion, while players will regularly run off on their own accord, even if they have the human-controlled icon above their heads. It feels more like rugby roulette than rugby union.When you eventually make it to the trial-and-error-style try-scoring mechanic, youll discover that there are two ways to score a try. The first, game-encouraged option is to click in the left or right stick to score a try. This proved to be a risky manoeuvre, though, as full-speed players had a tendency to dive over the dead-ball line, resulting in a penalty. Even the opposing team was guilty of this on one occasion, in an uncontested try opportunity. The second, guaranteed option for scoring a try is to run your player over the try line and wait to be tackled. Theres no option to get a player beneath a try attempt to stop them touching down the ball, and a button for charging down a kick is sorely lacking. While theres no sprint option, stamina didnt appear to come into play (despite its presence in the options menu), and pursuing players rarely catch up to a running player, even if their stats determine they should be able to. There are rare moments where the intended gameplay formula bounces to the top of the heap, and local co-op/competitive play improves the rhythm as it helps get around dealing with the atrocious AI. Local multiplayer has its own specific issues, however, particularly in regard to the weird system of tracking and switching players during co-op. Its worth noting the game looks decidedly last-gen, with dated visuals that can become confusing in certain matches where jersey colours are indistinguishable between friend and foe, especially when you consider how frequently players flock in front and behind the off-side line. The PlayStation 3 version of Rugby 15 is particularly ugly, with a lower resolution, darker presentation, plenty of jaggies and a terrible frame rate, to boot. Combine the unappealing visual presentation with the aforementioned game woes, and the PS3 version is unplayable in its current form.When you eventually make it to the trial-and-error-style try-scoring mechanic, youll discover that there are two ways to score a try.

In CS:GO there are a couple different game types that you can choose from: the classic Casual and Competitive matches centered around an attack/defend objective, the more forgiving Deathmatch in which you can use any guns and respawn regularly, and finally the once-unique Arms Race in which you kill enemies with a given weapon and begin cycling through every weapon in the game, one by one, until you've gotten a kill with each. As a beginner, I found it's best to start with Deathmatch or Arms Race, just to pick up on the mechanics of the game and its guns--because despite what it looks like, CS:GO isn't your typical shooter. This is a game that requires not only a steady hand and controlled shots, but manipulations of the game's intricacies just to control the recoil patterns of the guns. It's a steep learning curve, but this can become a fantastic game for those that give it time. If there's any advice I can give, it's to give yourself ample time to learn. Similar to a MOBA, you won't learn everything this game has to offer overnight--it just can't happen. Take your time, figure things out one by one, study your high-scoring opponents and teammates, and above all, remember that it's just a game and you're there to have fun. And if all else fails, just buy the Zeus to run around electrocuting people.
Poon;-;Only relevant competitive FPS game out there right now. Would be 10/10 if it was not for Valve's inability to balance the game around the competitive scene.

Echu;-;I never used to play CS: GO because I thought it was just another first-person shooter. I've never been so wrong in my entire life. CS: GO is a TACTICAL SHOOTER. It's not about charging in and spraying people down. The coordination between players and invidiual skill is what makes it such an enjoyable game. Players have to get those one or two headshots to kill an opponent, or else they'll kill you first. On a completely unrelated note, this is like hat simulator skin simulator. You can trade and buy skins to make your guns look cool, but skins don't matter in the competitive scene. For someone who enjoys first-person shooter, and wants an enjoyable game to play competitively and cooperatively, I definitely suggest they check out CS: GO. Thanks for reading my review guys ^.^ Peace (> #.#)> Echo
pantacool;-;Amazing game worth $15! Once you start getting into community servers its like a whole new game! i already have 70 hours of fun filled time and plan to have many, many more.

Arioni;-;Lacks wowmod, otherwise 9/10
Fat Albert;-;A really good game that takes a lot skill to play but sometimes the physics of the game can really get on your nerves for example when you get shot once you become a lot slower than normal and will most probably die. There are a lot of good aspects to the game including competitve play which enables you to be ranked against other players and there are good measurements put in place for team killers and people that rage quit. Overall a rteally good game that I would recommend.
Vulcun Command;-;It's still the best fps-game around ;)
PapaYoshii;-;Maybe the best shooter game out there, 10/10.

EngineRX;-;Really good game! CS:GO is really addicting , atleast for me. I love the skins you get and if you dont like them .. just sell them! :D This game is a really Skill-needed game and not like call of duty that everyone can be a pro. I'ts fun playing ! the ranks and comp matches... I recommend you buy it so you can feel how it is to play and not look at the pictures and say its crappy!
Dad;-;Awesome game if you're into FPS. Definately reccomend it.
Pam Poovey;-;Best game NA. Needs more Aztec tho.
InDogeWeTrust;-;very addicting and great
Sir Dank-kek;-;You can learn alot in this game. Like mating and apple picking, going balls deep in pizza, finding out Harry Potter actually happened and if you havn't ed Hermione (grown up) you're racist. Also cooking gingers are hard because their hair will burn too easily. 69/420 Better than school teachings.

griffiN #roadtodmg;-;Pros - Great multiplayer game for friends to spend some time on. Personally I love both modes of Defuse, and Hostage missions. Bost scenarios are lovely and fit the game. CS:GO is perfectly made for that FPS Gamer looking for a first-person-shooter P.C game. Great game. 9.5/10 Cons - A few maps are just a little one sided such as Assault and Aztec but other maps are great :) Overall Rating - 9.5/10
Burger40;-;* -Zoomed in with awp. -trying to shoot somebody across the map. -i shot but i moved an inch whilst i shot. -bullet went behind me, killing my teammate. -Got 1 shot HS'd across the map with USP. -teammate raging in russian because i killed him. -i also rage -i rage quit -get 8 days ban * Sums up my entire CS:GO experience. 2 reasons to like this game: -profit in skins -Gaben
Dr. Netmot;-;Counter Strike Global Offensive is a challanging tactical first person shooter that doesnt only require skill but also inteligence. The competetive multiplayer in this game is according to me the most enjoyable to watch the pros play and play yourself for countless of hours where every match feels like a new challange that you desperately need to beat. If you are a person that enjoys Shooters that require skill, map knowledge, intelligence and much more Counter Strike is a both great and cheap game for you!
CptJeT;-;Best game ever recommend to everyone
Hexed by the 700 club;-;No 9/11 map, and no planes. there are terrorists still so i'd rate 9/11

Tide;-;RUSSIAN SIMULATOR 2013 If you ask to be kicked because your team loses the first 2 rounds, you might be a russian. If your team calls eco round and you buy an AWP, you might be a russian. If the only 2 weapons you use are the AWP and p90, you might be a russian. If you win the first 9 rounds and say "GG EZ GAME", you might be a russian. If you call your teammate a noob because he failed the 1v5, you might be a russian. If you can't play on a us server without your ping going lower han 400, you might be a russian. If the only maps you put in the queue are dust2, you might be a russian. If you have a karambit fade in your inventory, but your rank is silver 2, you might be a russian. If you call hacks because your enemy shot you through a wall and he could see your shadow, you might be a russian. If you say "F*** your mother" every time you lose a game, you might be a russian. If you say the reason you're a silver is because of bad teammates, you might be a russian. If you call your global elite friend a ing noob after he carries you, you might be a russian. If you rush B as a terrorist every round on dust2, you might be a russian.
Vinyl Scratch;-;Not a smurf. Trust. 10/10
cl_mute_enemy_team 1;-;What a grate game. It not like the other First Person Shooters it is smart and you can use stretegy with friends. I recamend it to all of you of all ages. It is not dumb like CALL of Duty. Try it you wont regret it,.

Le Toucan;-;To keep it short, i once had a life. now i dont and i still dont care because csgo is love and csgo is life, and that is all you will ever need great thing it's only 13,99 euro. if you dont count the amount of euro's your gonna spend on skins and unboxings ofcourse further you shall find this game harder to learn but at the end worth it so much, and it has a more mature comunity than the most ive seen looking at that every matchmaking i play people say good luck, have fun! and at the end good game thanks for playing and all that good stuff, ofcourse there are trolls and people who refuse to talk english but that can be on every game. just buy it why are you even reading this still
Pepe the Frog;-;Great game
insanE;-;One of the best FPS games I ever played, the graphics is stunning, and the part I like the most is how smooth the game goes, even when Im using a crappy laptop, the game still runs smoothly without lag. This game requires skill and teamwork, controlling recoil, strategy, which I feel like this game can improve your awareness and tactics. I would rate this game 4.5/5, I would definetely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new FPS game.
Birthday Boy;-;9/10 Players Ready
drifta;-;I was in a 1v5 situtation and we were the CT's. I headshot a guy with my m4a4 and then went over to his body and picked up his AK47. I then went down a staircase to find a guy staring down at me. I shot him down quickly whilst also seeing another guy coming. I backed off and let him rush out, then killed him. By then, the bomb had been planted. I went to A bombsite and saw an AWPer so I killed him before he could 1 shot me. The last guy was camping next to the bomb with a P90, so I picked up the guy's AWP and saw a small bit of his head peeking out. Bam. He's dead. I quickly ran with my knife to the bomb and defused it...well most of it anyway. We lost because I was a second too late and the bomb exploded. 11/10 would play again
peanutbutter;-;It's ok
Some Stupid Asshole;-;Gameplay: insanely realistic, trained anti terrorists can not shoot unless they are completely still, shotguns can be used as sniper rifles. Balance of weapons: all weapons are very balanced. Especially the sniper that can 1 hit kill you anywhere but your pinky toe. Community: friendly and forgiving. Except for the ocassional team of 4 smurfs and a hacker that seems to happen every game, as well as the 2 members of your own team whocant speak english/are 7 years old. 11/10 would commit suicide again. seriously though
Yanya;-;I think the main enemy in this game are the chickens.
Neurox;-;>Russian's twelvies screaming at you >Being called a hacker after getting a headshot through a wall in an obvious place (e.g. Dust 2 doors) >Paired with unranked so you carry >No communication >Auto-sniping enemy plebs Otherwise great game. R8 8/8 m8

c0rbe * G2A.com;-;I thoroughly enjoy CS:GO. mostly the competitive aspect as I don't enjoy the casual gamemodes. Now, although competitive is full of hackers/trolls/smurfs it is an incredibly fun and engaging way to play. It teaches you how to play and there are many helpful guides online. The negatives, if you have a team who don't communicate it is a large issue as you cannot give information about the enemy and disucss tactics. Also, smurfers and hackers ruin matches but are vital in the learning curve of CS:GO as they teach you how to make better decisions and keep your cool. As myself, coming from mostly LoL I didn't struggle to pickup the game and found it as a great way to relax in casual gamemodes or play competitively. One large thing I didn't mention earlier is getting banned automatically. For example, you can become banned from kicking too many teammates, which I think is ridiculous, but is implemented. So a few tips, don't kick people unless you really have to and don't afk/leave. This will save you from some bans. It requires you to be proactive with your learning of the game to find tutorials and learn from more experienced players to do things such as strafe shooting and headshotting. If you can master these techniques you can do greatly. The ranking system is slightly confusing but requires you to win many rounds and games successfuly to rank up. It can become annoying but you will eventually rank up. TL;DR Great competitive scene, easy to learn but hard to master. Buy this game if you're looking for an FPS game that is unique and enjoyable to play with friends. 9/10 10/10 (If hackers and smurfers were lowered, but we all know that isn't possible)
flikZ;-;its the best game i ever played!
dalas the doler geter;-;I was positive about this game at first, but then i realised this game has an awful community and an awful ban system. I still recommend this game, but get some friends to play with. I got banned for a week for kicking too many trolls. Seriously valve?
stop cyber bullying!;-;learned fluent russian
boonie;-;Pretty fun, lots of cancer with the community, but not as bad as Leagues'. Great modding capability, and custom maps are always wanted.
NOOB CS KID BOOOOOO;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has skyrocketed the amount of people interested in the CS community. Although this game has its own great fame and glory there are still an amount of people in the toxicity area that the community has to deal with. Cheaters, Toxic Players, Trolls and even smurfing has become an issue to the game. A suggestion would be to bring back the old server-listed based matches and consider them ranked matches instead of Match-Making. Lets face it MM sucks . All people care about in this game is their Match-Making Rank. Like seriously Valve, the system needs to be re-established. Like what the  is 7 days ban for abandoning with a cheater on the other team????

CEVO-TV|Sabo;-;CS:GO is a clean and polished version of the little mod that could. Graphics are a dramatic improvement over Source and the classic levels have received little touch-ups for both looks and balance. It's a promising title that seeks to keep Counterstrike on top of the competitive shooter charts.

Y U NO PLANT?!?;-;Although a lot of stupid, , antisocial and sometimes maybe cheating people run around in this game, and unfortunately you have to play with then sometimes... Still it makes fun and won't let you go so easily for a long long time. So beware of it's addiction factor. But maybe I'm one of the people described above. Don't let the game get to you so hard, try to have fun and take it easy, that's what I should consider more often!

M.C.Clean17;-;This game turns me on...
MinTy;-;Note: This review contains a lot of butthurt. This game is actually very good. The community has nice people in it, but there is still a portion of terrible people. People ask me why I can't get ranked. The answer is simple. I get placed with teammates that troll and teamkill. Recently I played a comp game, and this is the first thing I heard: "Oh my god guys, is this League of Legends?" In a high pitched,  voice. At first, I found this funny, What happened next was not. First Eight Rounds in a Nutshell: - My teammates call me a little  for telling them where everyone is i.e "They are at Cat!" - My teammates start to kill each other. - 1 teammate leaves. - The other team is having a blast killing my teammates who are not even trying. - I get teamkilled several times. The next Eight Rounds: - Another teammate leaves, not before killing me however. - Another teammate starts to troll by throwing weapons in the air, running around with knife looking at sky. After the First Half: - Another teammate kills me. He leaves shortly after. - Another teammate kills me. He leaves. I am left all alone. - I ask the other team to just knife fight me. It doesn't go so well. - My team, I mean me (cause I was the only one on my team now) loses. Why do I still recommed this game? Well, except for the  people like them, it actually is quite a good game. However, you really need to play with friends. If you play alone, all the other people you play with will be . Thats the reason they were alone, they can't get any friends because they are mentally ill/ just stupid. This is only in Competitive however. Casual is quite nice because no one takes it seriously (including myself) so most of the time you actually get nice people who are just enjoying the game. I would recommend this game if you don't want to play Competitive, cause its just a  of stupid asshats who think they are cool for  over some persons day.

DontYellImHigh;-;Great game. Never thought this game would pull me away from my Call of Duty addiction. All i ever played was Search and destroy on COD but it isn't even close. 30 rounds of highly competitive, highly tactical and highly addictive gameplay from the originators of search and destroy. How does it get any better? It doesn't. This is the best FPS available hands down.
Eagle_Bro;-;Ive played this game for a while and I will give it a 8/10. The gameplay is addictive and you find yourself putting actual money in for the skins and cases, which dont actually affect the gameplay. The only bad things about this game is the fact that high level players can easily buy an extra copy of the game and start at the beginning. These players are called "Smurfs" and they are extremely skilled players playing with Newbs. This makes the game kind of unfair because you are supposed to only play against people at or around your level. But you just have to deal with it. Its still a great game with some great competitive fun.
Milla Jovovich is Taylor Swift;-;IS COCAINE

CrushKillDestroy;-;My original review was not too nice towards CSGO, but I've given it some time to get updated and whatnot and let me just say, it has improved greatly. It has become an excellent modern replacement to CSS. There are servers for all players, from noob to elite, and they're populated all day and night. Graphics options are top shelf and well optimized. Great job making CSGO what it should be Valve.

-zarror-;-;Cs:Go is probably the best shooter out there. There are so many "AAA" Shooters out there for example "Battlefield" or "Call of Duty". Every Year there is a new "AAA" Game like this and you have to spend 30-60$ for this games. For Cs:Go you only have to spend 10-15$, and a new Counter Strike game comes only all 8-12 years. But you shouldn't start playing this game alone, tell your friends and play with them. So why should you buy the game? -It is very cheap -You can play it with your friends -You can earn money with it (creating weapon skins, bet on pro teams with skins or real money) -The Cs:Go Community is the probably biggest and best Community there is out there :) Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed my review :).

Periwinkle Power Ranger;-;Stephen Hawking thinks AI is going to spell the end of mankind in the far future, apparently, but rest assured ladies and gentlemen. Play few hours of this game and you'll learn that Bots CANT AIM AI IS INCAPABLE OF REPLICATING NORMAL BLOODY SHOOTING IN A FPS, THEN WE HAVE A VERY LONG TIME BEFORE THE END OF HUMANITY IS UPON US, MR.HAWKING. MY CAT COULD SHOOT BETTER THAN THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THIS GAME.
[ZGG] TheZaz969;-;A fun addition to the Counter Strike series. It keeps the beauty of the original, with new graphics.
Dreijer;-;Nice game!
Le Toucan;-;To keep it short, i once had a life. now i dont and i still dont care because csgo is love and csgo is life, and that is all you will ever need great thing it's only 13,99 euro. if you dont count the amount of euro's your gonna spend on skins and unboxings ofcourse further you shall find this game harder to learn but at the end worth it so much, and it has a more mature comunity than the most ive seen looking at that every matchmaking i play people say good luck, have fun! and at the end good game thanks for playing and all that good stuff, ofcourse there are trolls and people who refuse to talk english but that can be on every game. just buy it why are you even reading this still

That Basso Bass;-;Play it everyday
Atirion;-;Do I enjoy this game? YES. I've played a ton of CS 1.6 and CS:S through my youth, and I guess I was a bit sour about a new Counter Strike game... I didn't like it in the beginning, but I didn't give it a good try. My friends forced me into a few matches saying "You haven't tried it". I said, "Okay" and I do not regret one single hour of it! The low cost and the nearly infinite amounts of hours of replayability! It's certainly a game worth playing if you yet haven't played it. It's a game everyone can enjoy. Good or bad player, hardcore or soft player. It's a challenge for everyone with their Matchmaking system. Yes, there are quite a few hackers due to the fact the game is so cheap. But meh. It's still the best game I have ever played! :)
Dylmonster;-;This is a highly skilled first person shooter with good community
mefaca;-;Played for a while, very enjoyable game if you are not playing competitive with strangers. Otherwise full of screams, ""s and trolls.
[Trading] Ega;-;Want to learn Russian? This is the game for you, you can learn all the different types of Russians too, like the mad Russian, the screaming Russian, the mad Russian, the mad Russian, and the screaming Russian! Never heard a Russian scream so loud at me when I didn't "rush mid with knife then go b." Overall 10/10 - IGN
I don't actually like anime.;-;This game ing blows, It banned me for a week.
iWebber;-;Story/Presentation: 8 There really is no story, just a setting of two teams clashing at each other, one being a team of Terrorists and the other of Counter-Terrorists. Based heavily on it's previous games, Counter-Strike: Global, it's look and feel of the game is graphically enhanced in so many aspects. The game and feel makes it so much more intense when you're either trying to plant bombs or defusing, or even when you're saving hostages or keeping them. It does get slightly repetitive after a while, but being it only multiplayer and online, the experience is always different and fun, even if playing with friends. It also has really awesome weapon skins you can get in game, but because of that, mods aren't allowed in this game, specially skin mods. The only complain I got is the server malfunctions at times. It's too constant, and leaves you unable to play Many times. Gameplay: 9 It plays Very well! The gun control and balance to each one is very well spot on to choose a good one of your own liking. Team tactics are heavily used in this game, specially with the buy weapons feature. Competitive mode is lots of fun, and it's very well set up with it's ranking feature, letting you spot you on where you belong depending on your skill in game. Even though I only have a gamepad, I can tell it's Highly recommended to use a mouse/keyboard to get really good at this game. But I'm only gaming to have fun, not to play competively. Overall: 9 Although the game can be Pretty repetitive at times, but it's still worth coming back to play over and over again, and it's much better than most FPS out there. I have lots of fun in this game and I highly recommend it to anybody into FPS.

FH | Ccapz;-;Great game if you are looking to spend your money on facing cheaters.
The Ace;-;You're not the winner Your enemies not the winner Valve is FOR DRAINING ALL OF YOU BRATS' WALLETS SMH
flotterbackes;-;This game is hurting my balls. I can't really say if I should recommend it or advise you to toss it in the next trashcan you see. It's loads of fun when you're playing with mates and you're really having a good time. - sometimes It's making me sick and really pisses me off. There are alot of smurfers and cheaters - sometimes This game has so many good things: - Matchmaking ranks - Skins - A variation of gamemodes - Community servers - A good balance - A nice competitive mode But also alot of bad things: - Hackers - Smurfers - Troller/ Deranker/ Griefer - Teammates that are impossible to understand/ that are just s <3 - A horrible so called "Case opening addiction" comes with it. But seriously. This game will make you rage and it'll make you laugh. You just need to know when it's enough. It has a variation of gamemodes/ guns/ people and chickens. There are funny, good but also bad updates. There are alot of scammers and alot of phisher around the game. I can't really decide what I should say. I had a good time playing this game. I had a bad time playing this game. Try it yourself. It's worth the 15. If you don't want to pay as much you can just wait for the next sale. See you in-game!
madaxeTHE warrior withTHE semsir;-;I played Call of Duty 4 profesionally but the game is kinda dead now.So i wanted to play another fps game to go tournaments, make a team, set a cool skins in my inventory.The CS:GO is 1st fps game now world wide.But CoD4 was epic.
JIJOO12;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, is one of the best FPS games i've ever played. You will never get bored playing it over and over because everyday, you will learn new tricks and tips which will upgrade your skills. The best veteran part is the aiming it self. I highly recommend to download training maps and train for your aim, because its very important to upgrade your aiming skills in order to countinue processing this game. Basicly, the game graphics is pretty nice, with low amount of bugs. the only issues are: -random votecalls by players ingame -Rusty and unfair ranking system -over-valued items -Addiction! I Rate 10/10
Natsume-Kun;-;this games is realy realy awesome ^-^
P13K | <NoscopeGlasses.com>;-;Very fun, but tough game to play
Queeeperinooo;-;It's fun and you get to know people and you need to have team work.
Sly;-;Great game.
NOOB CS KID BOOOOOO;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has skyrocketed the amount of people interested in the CS community. Although this game has its own great fame and glory there are still an amount of people in the toxicity area that the community has to deal with. Cheaters, Toxic Players, Trolls and even smurfing has become an issue to the game. A suggestion would be to bring back the old server-listed based matches and consider them ranked matches instead of Match-Making. Lets face it MM sucks . All people care about in this game is their Match-Making Rank. Like seriously Valve, the system needs to be re-established. Like what the  is 7 days ban for abandoning with a cheater on the other team????
ItzVortex-CSGOFAST.COM;-;one of the best multiplayer shooters!!! dust is back again!!!! a lot of R@G3 the best combetitive for a game and the final good is AWP 10/10
KokoRO;-;>join match >get a 4k in the pistol round >die >watch the last enemy get an ace >get kicked for not getting the ace 9/11 would teamkill again
Alfalafel the Sexy Driver;-;A good FPS, with competitive mode, casual, DM etc. Really fun to play with friends Collect skins you like for weapons. Bet on tournaments
FREE LX;-;In this Game u can learn: -Russian -German -French - -Turkish -Swedish It's better than School Lessons.
Sme;-;It's a great game that has it's downsides - You will 2 out of 3 times get in a team with flaming russians that are premade so you can't kick them - The ranking system is totally ed up, Win 8 games in a row and then loose 2 and get deranked - You will rage and throw your computer away But after that you will still get your  together only to come back and rage some more...
Maverick;-;Shot a guy in the nuts with an AWP and he instantly died. 10/10
AnTicWolf;-;One of the best games I have played in a long time
Krispy Anal;-;It is truly worth the money. This next installment of the notorious "Counter-Strike" series takes it to an all new level. Featuring breaktaking nostalgia, and even new maps to conquer. Along with weapons with different stats and skins, your gun will be unique down to the very bone of your trigger finger. Don't miss out on this great game!
GeT_JaCkEd_MaN;-;The ultimate competitive shooter. Steep learning curve and a gigantic amount of fun. 1.6 was a classic. Source was magnificent. And THIS. Well, let's just say it is a mix between those two. *UPDATE* Little things that I hate about this game that are STILL here - Overpowered and cost effective pistols - Round and bomb timers on competitive Valve servers - 64 tick on COMPETITIVE Valve servers - Flash-bangs still suck balls - Hand grenades still suck balls - Smoke grenades are still overpowered - Maps are very constrictive - M249 needs buff/cost reduction - Shotguns should get some more shot - SMGs deserve more....something - Movement is still more fast paced than previous Counter Strike games 8/10. Unfortunately, the game right now is all about the NEW SKINS AND THE NEW KNIVES WOW COOL WOW!!!!!!
12er bizeps;-;the best mix out of source and 1.6.
Mike;-;great game!
shz;-;2/10 would play again
Wayneggnog;-;*Russian accent 'Ideot'
S Lurem;-;Playing CS:GO is like taking a drug. You will rage, curse, smash your keyboard, because of some  your teammates do, got kicked out of the game, got teamkilled until you decide to do a teamkill too but got banned instead, yet still playing the game. And lastly you are VAC'ed. Best  ever. "10/10 would rage again" -IGN
Snipars;-;bought it for 9.99 goes on sale for 4.99 10min later gr8 m8
dizzyLife ();-;Great game, competetive cs #1
shake it baby;-;Good Game, Bad Players.
Lost;-;such game much wow so RAWR
RachelSaJ;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is all I look for in a multiplayer first-person shooter. With gamemodes just for fun; arms race, deathmatch, casual, demolition, and gamemodes for those who wish to take the game more seriously and use ranked matchmaking; comepetitive. It is truly a great game, for a great price. I recommend this game to my homies, your homies, your dad, your grandma, hell- even your dog. Buy CS:GO and I don't think you'll be disappointed :)
Emy;-;I just want more EXP. But amazing game, ofcourseeeee.
UB3R - A Guy's Owner #TFGO;-;11/10 would bang! An amazing (not  ALL THE TIME) FPS that will change the way you play everything

Jukechuu - Master Baiter;-;Is call of duty getting boring to play? Is fast paced gameplay getting pointless and kills makes you feel nothing? i have answer to all your questions! buy Counter strike: global offensive today and enjoy working as team with all the russians around internet, it will only cost quarter of CoD's price and you can buy a bunch of pointless skins and knives that gives you zero advantage in the actual gameplay!!!
Kinny;-;The return of an awesome game! Now with new maps, gamemodes, weapons and redefined graphics.
keyN;-;Quality game
T-Ray;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive also known as Angry Russian Simulator, is a great game for people who want to learn russian or just play de_dust2 one million times.
Zoot;-;sick game, anooying and good teamwork
vozah =DD;-;I wanted a knife, I bought a key, I prayed to Gaben for knife, Gaben gave me bizon. After many days of crying and asking Gaben for forgiveness for my wrong doing, I heard about the crate Indians. The Indians control what you get when you unbox, when it rolls and a good weapon comes they switch it so you rage. One day I will have my revenge on the crate Indians.

KingEddi Kara P2&Flip BP;-;In this game if you don't have an expensive virtual knife you're a nub pretty much sums up the game and remember everyone that owns a karambit fade is super duper pro! Also if your low rank use dis excuse " i cant get out of silver cuz rusian teammates"
jerry;-;Nice game and far from anything else,the variety of maps in this game is huge!
Chalky;-;This game is very good :)
LNY;-;good game but matchmaking is broken.
SKT T1 Faker;-;I found this game to worth so much more than $15 to me. It has become such a great investment, both in terms of time and enjoyment. 10/10
LegendaryGuardian;-;This game is about many things one of the things is to switch your weapons back and forth thats 70% of the game the other thing that this game is about is spamming the 'F' key thats 15% and the the other 15% is to use psycology, tacticts, and aiming to kill the enemy team with your team. 900/100 would spam 'F' again
Jennifer Lawrence;-;If you dont get this game Gaben will be angry and steal your wallet funds.
ElectricBoogalo_o;-;One of the best FPS games out right now! The community is usually good. If you buy this game, prepare to spend your paycheck on skins!

TwityTwisty;-;love this game! nice game! awsome! i like the the maps , the skins , the mods , awsome job ! love it! you have to buy it only 15$ for that game!
DetectiveBagelNips;-;It's not hard.
Cheapy The Cheapskate;-;Edit - After much playing time and at least 40 bucks put into the game, it's safe to say that I have fallen victim to this first person shooter's cruel ways. I cannot seem to help myself when it comes to unboxing; no matter how much I tell myself it's a game and how slim the chances are of getting an expensive knife to brag about, I still find myself unboxing and unboxing. It's almost as bad as breaking an addiction to drugs; it takes a good year to break the addiction and help from a few friends, and by the time you have broken the addiction, you're broke and miserable. I could've spent the remaining 10 dollars on my account on another game, but next thing you know, I find myself unboxing another crate only to earn an item worth five cents. To someone who doesn't play CS:GO, a few pixels in-game may not seem that valuable. Believe me, I thought this too. But once you start to play this game, your credit card info is already being punched into Steam, and next thing you know, you're doing a 20 crate unbox via livestream. It's so upsetting (unless you're one of the lucky few who get something good) you vow to yourself that you are going to quit; but you are back and playing the next morning. I must give credit to Gaben for coming up with such a successful idea. The fact that a man can make hundreds of millions from a game involving a few skins that don't affect game experience is amazing. But once you realize the harsh reality of your purchases and such, you start to feel as much misery and regret as a man who skydives from a plane only to find out he forgot his parachute. Now for the gameplay, this game is actually fun if you can get through a week without getting yourself a seven day ban. If you're an obedient player who respects teammates and never leaves games early, then you're golden. However, if you happen to misclick and kill a team mate, or the power goes out during a game, you'll most likely find yourself a nice fat "Competitive Cooldown" which is just a polite way of saying "You're Banned". Yes, I know players who don't follow the rules should be delivered corresponding consequences, but one can find themselves receiving a ban for some of the most peculiar reasons. For example, someone can be banned from playing for "kicking too many players". For starters, kicking a player is majority rule; so chances are, if you decide to kick someone from a game, they're not doing diddly crap to help the team. If you get enough of these dimwads kicked, you pay the price for it. Kicking players for a reason is much different than kicking players for the hell of it, which the game fails to understand. From personal experience, I have never gotten a seven day ban, but I have known plenty of people who have from ways such as this. Most bans are well deserved, but a few are unjust and unavoidable. This game has a 0 tolerance policy towards the latter. For a summary of things so far, you pay loads of money to earn a few pixels and the ban system can be unjust at times. But don't get me wrong - this game is far from bad. In fact, I would easily recommend it to someone who's into games. This game takes time to master, and actually involves skill along with strategy, unlike many games today which strongly revolve around luck. Skill plays a major role in this game, because without it, you'll wind up in the lower ranks of the game. Lastly, I would like to talk about the community. Among the squeakers, spoiled brats, white kids who think they're black, Neo-Nazi's, and etc. there are actually some pretty decent people you can meet. If you're looking for a place to make friends, this is the exact wrong place to do it. However, the community makes for an interesting experience which you can find no other place. I make it sound bad, I know, but there are some very intelligent and bright individuals who you can learn a lot from in-game. To wrap things up before this review gets so long I publish it and make it a novel, I would like to say CS:GO is an expertly made game used to earn tons of money everyday. While most of the review has a negative connotation, I would like to say that this game is probably one of the best games you can find on the market today, which is a major accomplishment considering all the competiton between next-gen consoles and new technology being released. Well done, Gaben. Well done. TL;DR - While CS:GO may take your money and create mind-blowing rage, it's still an addicting shooter with a simple concept which has unique perks that no other game has.
Ellie Goulding;-;WORST ING GAME EVER DO NOT BUY THIS  HOLE OF A GAME I LOST MY CHILDHOOD BC OF THIS GAME  U VALVE AND UR ING HACKERS  U SKINS  U ERS  CS U CANT SPELL ISIS WITHOUT CS

Egg Benedict;-;idk why I kept playing dis
zavabia;-;if Eastern Europe was a game, it would be CSGO. Still fun, despite the angry russian 13 year olds.
pedo bear;-;This is one of the greatest competitive games of all time, definetly the best competitive FPS. This game is an amazing amount of fun if you started playing in source(in which case you probably own this already) or if your a new player like i was. First of all it is great to see you and your friends skill develop as you get higher up the ranks, and you can sill have a good evenly matched game if you are in the lower ranks. Second of all the community of this game is pretty much endless and that means there are always new maps coming out and hundreds of custom gamemodes. This game really diferentiates from other games on the market right now with its learning curve and skill cap. If you dont own this game you are doing yourself a diservice and for 12 or $15 this game is a complete steal for the amount of hours you can put into it. :)
Juanma;-;This game is clean.
Colbylock;-;its a game
Counter-Life;-;What can I say, there's nothing like the rush of hunting people down and killing them!

Revan The Worthless Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

MasteR SainT #CooL DowN 7 Days;-;CS GO IS BEST GAME IN WORLD YES / NO :)
|Raysun;-;I used to have dreams and aspirations. Then I started playing CS. CS: Not Even Once.
DansGame;-;CSGO is a broken game with broken mechanics and broken gameplay; much like Volvo's other love baby DOTA 2. Although CSGO will forever fail to match the unfathomable depth of trash-tier into which DOTA so neatly fits, where you are subject to internet Russians clicking on you while hurling abuse and touching themselves at night. Amidst smurfs and angry Eastern Europeans, one may find themselves wondering why they even bother to sink time into the game. AM I TALKING ABOUT CSGO OR DOTA YOU ASK? DOESN'T EVEN MATTER. DON'T MATTER HOW SH*T LOOKS IT ALL STINKS IN THE END. VOLVO PLS. PLS. 10/10 would spend hundreds of pounds on again.

Itachi Uchiha;-;I finally learned Russian! Took me long enough. Rated 10/10!
nova_vortex;-;Recent Intel reports suggests the likelihood of ISIS using CS:GO as a platform to train talented terrorists, scout for new members and conduct trials for recruits. They hide under common everyday aliases, training 10+ hours a day sometimes practising their hacking skills, which explains why the servers will never truly be empty and this game will never truly die due to the underground growing population of ISIS. During the process of training, those rare skins earned by thousands daily are in turn sold illegally to the world for real cash to fund their terror operations. As far as we know, ISIS strategy & actions had been successful in GLOBALLY OFFENDING everyone.

Scribles;-;This is an amazing 10 out of 10 competitive ,team-based, FPS for the PC, that has all the emphases on team. This game is non-stop action that requirs constant comunication, and fast reactions. This is no COD, or Battlefield, this is hardcore, no jokes. The basic idea of the game is , 5 on 5 terrorists vs counter terrorist. The terroritsts have to plant a bomb on 1 of 2 bombsites. the counter-terorists need to either kill all the terrorits, defuse the bomb, or prevent the terrorests from planting the bomb in 2 minites. Easier said then done. -Stay low, move fast, shoot first, die last,one shot, one kill, no luck, pure skill.

[TFT] Jaffa Cakes [Stab Studios];-;Pros: - Good Graphics. - Balanced. - Good Match Making System. - Good Trading Community. - Steam Workshop Support. - 5 vs 5 Combat. - 1st Person Shooter. Cons: - People Trick the Match Making system so they play with lower ranked people so they never get out of their tier. - People Troll and Mic Spam a lot. - No Single Player. - Missions coins that you buy will Permanently expire whenever Valve wants them to so you can no longer play Missions. Conclusion: This game is a Team-Based shooter that has not single player missions, it is a Multiplayer Only game. This game has nice graphics that suit the style of the game and also has well made maps. Some maps are made by the Community and so are almost all Gun Skins, gun skins are very well made and are the little bit ion top that makes this game a lot better. This game is nicely made and it mainly consists of 5 vs 5 combat with other people. The only this that makes this game a little bit worse is the lack of help that is given whenever you report someone for being trolls and things like that. Overall Rating: 9/10
Syringe;-;Long ago, exactly 359 hours ago of gameplay, I was called forth by Lord Gaben. He spoke of a world soon to enter our galaxy, Steam. I, one of the many 'Chosen' lined up row by row, shoulder by shoulder inside of his commander room. He stood before us, wearing a Jigsaw mask and said "Let's play a game" before all went black. upon the 100 hour mark, I finally grasped the concept of the world. The inhabitants of the world called it 'Counter Strike' because the Counter Terrorist forces are trying all they can to 'Counter' the Terrorist's 'Strike'. In this world of Counter Strike, there's a raging war between two groups. Hence 'Global Offensive'. In my journeys, I have kept note of everything I have learnt about this bizzar world. There are many raging, endless wars held in different dimentions with ten people in the battle. The heart of the war lies in the sacred grounds of De_Dust 2. Over thousands of dimentions have been put up to hold every single battle of each ten participants, but at times, during the teleportation, one can suddenly have a heart attack and end up canceling the twenty second count down to start the battle. This happened to me too many times, but I kept on going. Lord Gaben made clones of himself using his 'Shadow Clone' ability to monitor each and every battle, managing them ever so properly from a bird's eye view. That feeling of being watched will never leave me nor the other 'Chosen'. At the beginning of the battle you become able to summon a magical interface that allows you to select anything you want at the cost of money which you earn by completing objectives. Solve an equasion with the alien locator-like calculator to plant it in the super secret sites known as 'A' and 'B'. To sum it up, the Counter Terrorists are basically Aliens who plan to not only eliminate you with their overpriced weapons, but to force you to join forces with them after the battle to strenghten their Queen Alien. After 200 hours, I noticed that as a Terrorist, after taking off my old mask and clothes that I've worn since the beginning of time, I noticed that my skin was a very light green and underneath my black shades, were pitch black eyes... Dear God... At that moment, I realised that Terrorists were Preditors... But that didn't stop there. One day, at the 300 hour mark after hitting Nova 2, THEY came... Oh Gaben... Dear Gaben NO! They were small, blue and wore white robes as they held their mini pea shooters in their tiny arms... It was THEM. The... Smurfs... I realised that it was this time of the year again... The Steam Universal Trade Off where anyone could clone themselves to paricipate in the war of Counter Strike. Never have I been so frightened in my entrie life... And on the other side of the battlefield, were the legendary NIP. Warlords of the game, Knights of Gaben and the anti-biotics of everything. Hell broke loose in this battle and I found myself getting beaten up by the Yellow Ninjas in Pyjamas who resembed the Bannana's in Pyjamas almost perfectly... Then it hit me... When they became Terrorists, one of them wrote on the tellekenetic "Mid 2 B", I immediately knew their true identities... The murderous Bannanas in Pyjamas... 350 hours over, and at this point I decided to open some of the cases I gained from air ships that passed by every morning. Only the ones nearby and away from everyone else... Dear Gaben... I heard from an old man that he became mentally distressed the moment he picked up an AK47 Fire Serpent Factory New from a drop. Not because of the pure beauty of the gun... No... But because of the horrific amount of people who "U WOT M8!? THAT's A GR8 B8 M8! GIVE US YA LIGHTER'd him... And now at 359 hours of play... I realised that there are other people watching on GOTV... At that moment, I knew the deadly and sorroful secret of the world of Counter Strike... It's a TV show, hosted by Gaben... And millions of people are watching us right now, watching your moves... 10/10-IGN: Waiting for Counter Strike: Isolation, ready to kick some CT alien ! 9/10-PC Gamer: Well, the COULD have done better with the drama... 99/100-Rock Paper Scissors: Just like Rock Paper Scissors! Only with Skyrim! 13/37: Game Informer: Love the romance element! GOTY for sure!

p0e;-;This is, without a doubt, the only game for competitive FPS players. The only advantage one player has over an other is skill, there are no perks, airstrikes or unfair advantages.

Klass1c;-;I don't always report, but when I do, they have a question mark as their profile picture.
Rast;-;MY EXPERIENCE IN CSGO I went into this game thinking its just another generic shooter, aim down the sights, aim for the head, all that sort of , but then i found out about skins, buy a 40c gun 'Max im ever going to pay for skins is $3' i told myself. 2 months later buys a $25 gun 'that was a rediculous waste of money' 6 weeks later, buys a $63 gun 'im pushing it' one week later buys a $130 knife and hopes one day an M4A4 howl will be in his inventory. if you want to buy this game, go into it knowing your not spending $15 on it, your going to spend hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of dollars on it in some cases, oh and the cases 'if your going to be stupid and waste your money on skins, dont try to get them via cases 10/10 best money waste simulator

GeT_JaCkEd_MaN;-;The ultimate competitive shooter. Steep learning curve and a gigantic amount of fun. 1.6 was a classic. Source was magnificent. And THIS. Well, let's just say it is a mix between those two. *UPDATE* Little things that I hate about this game that are STILL here - Overpowered and cost effective pistols - Round and bomb timers on competitive Valve servers - 64 tick on COMPETITIVE Valve servers - Flash-bangs still suck balls - Hand grenades still suck balls - Smoke grenades are still overpowered - Maps are very constrictive - M249 needs buff/cost reduction - Shotguns should get some more shot - SMGs deserve more....something - Movement is still more fast paced than previous Counter Strike games 8/10. Unfortunately, the game right now is all about the NEW SKINS AND THE NEW KNIVES WOW COOL WOW!!!!!!

What about paints?" -Valve Employee "Paints. Perfect! What about stickers? Everyone loves stickers!" -Gabe "Great! So we have crates, stranges, paints, and stickers. What about name tags?" -Valve Employee "Oh god! We can't forget name tags! Let's charge $1.99 a piece!" -Gabe "Marvelous! Let's call crates cases, stranges stattraks, paints skins, and stickers stickers!" -Valve Employee "I'm game as long as we don't have to make any more content!" -Gabe "That's what the community is for! haha!" -Valve Employee "I know! haha!" -Gabe

Maze;-;the skins in this game ruined it. This game is beatuful, skillful, competitive...but...the amount of unfair people cheating, scamming and doing  is too big. In every game you play, whatever is your rank, you will get mad for the cheaters you face and will be quite impossible to have fun. But the problems will come also if you don't play. You'll receive an amount of friend request from private profile if you have a good skin that will be impossible to substain. They'll spam some links to get your good weapons and you'll have to block them but... Even if they don't have a private profile, they look like they want to trade they will scam you anyway. This game show you the real face of the people in the world, don't ever trust anyone. Don't buy this game, is much better to waste money in beer, at least you get some fun.

Revan The Worthless Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

Unrequited Love ^^ CSGORage.com;-;help me relax after play dota 2
PerfectChaos97;-;This game is ok with friends but randoms just suck. There is no teamwork usage just like those who play CoD. For some reason no one ever buys wards and enemy team always ganks us as they plant/diffuse the bomb. There are only 2 sides CT and T side and most maps are always T sided so we get rekt on the CT side. Plus the Queen be saving all the money for her crumpits and tea so she raises the price of the guns on the CT side and we always poor like we in the struggle or something. Like WTF is up with that, the T side got all the newest pairs or Jordans and CT's stuck with some ratchet walmart brand shoes!!! Treyarch better add a welfare system to this game or I'm not gonna put up with this no more. My final verdict on the game is a 10/10 could be better.
KEL;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first person shooter that demands group strategy and communication in order to win. I have played hundreds of hours and keep coming back for more. The community can be discriminatory at times, however, there is always the option of muting a player. The game itself updates frequently via Steam, which can cause delays in matchmaking, but it only takes a few minutes. My only qualm with CS:GO is the blatant lack of registry encountered in some matches. It does not happen often, but when it does, it is frustrating. Overall, I have played CS for 5 years and have met some talented players/friends, and wouldn't change it for the world. For those of you interested in joining a good cause, please visit the "NO TROLL" group page for information on my anti-cyberbullying campaign. I am the founder. Good luck and have fun.

elphieJESUS;-;Coming from a long history of 1.6 and division 1 competitive lan finals (I skipped source). I returned to counter strike after a long hiatus and am finding the game decent. Valve has done a great job of capturing the essence of what I loved about 1.6 and implementing it into their own game. Although some of the maps have changed, some for the better and some for worse (Inferno mainly), overall my experience has been positive and I have had a good time ranking up with my buddies from Strokecity: elpmeister (He nem corn), INZAYN (Sponsored by OzBongs), Liam Pain (He nat go gym anymor he say), diamond direktor (he sell pill), dumsan (dumsan dumman), feels berlin (he always leav cal earli 4 sum reason I dunno) and many more. I find the game crispy, salty, not too greasy. CS:GO is good, and a BUY. - Leonard's food reviews.

GodsDead;-;A great addition to the Counter-Strike franchise, From a die-hard counter-strike and FPS fan, this is my favourite FPS game at present.
nova_vortex;-;Recent Intel reports suggests the likelihood of ISIS using CS:GO as a platform to train talented terrorists, scout for new members and conduct trials for recruits. They hide under common everyday aliases, training 10+ hours a day sometimes practising their hacking skills, which explains why the servers will never truly be empty and this game will never truly die due to the underground growing population of ISIS. During the process of training, those rare skins earned by thousands daily are in turn sold illegally to the world for real cash to fund their terror operations. As far as we know, ISIS strategy & actions had been successful in GLOBALLY OFFENDING everyone.
SkazzY | Puss In Boots;-;Amazing game. Recomend to all to play.
Krispy Anal;-;It is truly worth the money. This next installment of the notorious "Counter-Strike" series takes it to an all new level. Featuring breaktaking nostalgia, and even new maps to conquer. Along with weapons with different stats and skins, your gun will be unique down to the very bone of your trigger finger. Don't miss out on this great game!
Alfalafel Gatekeeper of Sewers;-;A good FPS, with competitive mode, casual, DM etc. Really fun to play with friends Collect skins you like for weapons. Bet on tournaments

Lazah;-;Waste of time.
uang ling;-;Lovely game, or so it was. the game was excellent with amazing an unique game styles compared to COD or BF. It was an addicting game until the smurfs, hackers and griefers/trolls came about. Now csgo is a cluster of 1 team filled with idiots and that 1 try hard guy on the team while the other is a full-on hacker/smurf. Sure is it fun to have a smurf on your team but the other team wont. What point is there to the game if someone else plays for you? Overall the game is unique and fun but the s who smurf, hack or troll pushes this game down.
mephisto;-;Great game, but have in mind - hard to learn, harder to master ;-) This is not just aim and shoot ;-)

Pickstarr;-;When I first got this game, I was depressed by the overly-god players. I even made a previous review saying it was 6/10. Now, after a year of not playing, I decided reinstalling this game. Wow. I. Love. It. 11/10. GG, Valve. *EDIT* 7/19/14 This game... the competitve match making and banned sucks. We had a full lobby and just one person out of country and Valve couldn't connect us to any match, even after half an hour of trying. Then, lets go onto their banning system. It is not fair. I've been doing great, recently, like 5 days without a ban. I think that the banning system should lower down on the amount of days you get banned - on the amount of days you were good... if that makes sense. Please, Valve. This is such a great competitve game, but you have to fix that. *EDIT* 12/6/14 VAC Banned. CS:GO. I love you. I know I got desperate. I was desperate to become better than my friends, good enough to not be judged. Unfortunetly, I got to greedy. I decided to hack you. Just basic stuff, Wall Hacks. I know I got greedy. I know you'll never love me. But, I will always love you. R.I.P CS:GO/Pickstarr 12/16/14 10:15 EST I will always love you, dear CS.
Traitor_kill_me;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The most offensive game ever created. 99% of the terrorists are middle-eastern.

Stannis the Mannis;-;I won a game 16-0 and made a kid rage so hard he smashed his keyboard. 10/10 game.
[AG] OvenableSora;-;Wonderful game. One of the best competitive FPS games out there. Matchmaking can be quite awful at times, it has quite a few hackers, and casual is ing horrid, but other than that this game is fun, enjoyable, and stressful.
Custard;-;It may be fifteen dollars, but is a fantastic game for all who love strategic and FPS games. It is short combat (5v5) and has weapons from AWP's (Sniper rifle) to Negev's (Heavy fire machine gun) and more. It also comes with a different combination of grenades and pistols. The only downside is that people tend to get serious over nothing, but is still tons of fun. So if you want to buy it, then buy it, because it is definitly worth fifteen dollars. If you love any valve game or shooter game, than this is the game for you.
Kodish;-;I have a love hate relationship with this game, as do most people :P
Noodles;-;Great FPS game. Provides in depth, realistic strategies finishing off to be a superb game [THE NIGERIANS:5/5]
Inspiration;-;I'm not very good at this game, but it's still pretty fun getting destroyed and insulted.
Stormbird 1104;-;The best First Person Shooter I've ever played. It has addictive gameplay. I would say more but I'm not even sure if it's good. It's just so addicitve. - It's the Minecraft of First Person Shooters. Better yet I even managed to get my money back from buying the game, I even got profit! The in-game drops can be worth up to 2000, now that there should be enough reason to make anyone buy it. It's basically free, and in some cases, they PAY YOU to play the game (Profit from selling drops). It has an economy system, great gameplay on loads of maps, updated frequently with new maps and operations, and workshop support for community maps and even the ability to make your own skins to appear in-game! It also has custom game mods such as Jailbreak and Zombie Escape, if that's your sort of thing. Personally I prefer competitive gameplay. It's not just click play and casually kill people. Each round is like life or death. You win, you could get ranked-up. Lose and it could be back to Silver I! (Of course not literally, this is metaphorically speaking, although it could be literal for some players...) You get co-operative teams where the people don't just shout at you or shoot at you (most of the time). It's e-sports for everyone! Overall, my favourite game on Steam, hopefully soon my most played (It already would be if it wasn't for Garry's Mod's loading times...) 10/10 P.S. If there's any spelling mistakes complain to Valve not me as there is no spellcheck and I often make mistakes while typing.
BearCS;-;It have 800 hours on it and are increasing by 90 everyweek. I can feel my body decomposing because I haven't showered in weeks because of this game. 10/10 would not shower again.
Fade;-;Best program to learn russian
DONUTonPC;-;I like it when I win, but not when I lose..... 10/10 donkey
ValarMorghulis;-;cs:go is the community of rainbows and unicorns , nobody ever insults or berates others whilst spewing derogatory racial/ethnic/gender rants . all players say please and thank you before team killing/damaging . everyone always follows the rules , never hacks /cheats . the people of this community respect each other and embrace their differences . nobody ever gets kicked from a game , nor do they kick others . this is the kindest , gentlest , user friendly game ever made 10/10 would rq again.
kofoten;-;Currently learning russian from my teammates
DarkCloud;-;Great game and a challenging FPS! Unlike most other FPS's recoil plays a huge factor in this game. The online play is amazing and fun! Overall I reccomend this to anyone looking for a cheap FPS with quality content. Can't go wrong with spending 15$ :)
Suspicious;-;The only thing better than having great team work, accuracy, and always winning is doing it all with style or with re-skins.
S H ! F T;-;Team Fortress,    - .

BaZa;-;Great game, consumes to much of my social life though
Whalez;-;This game is very addictive and fun to play. A range of different game modes for different skill levels. I reccomend this game to anyone who likes tactical FPS games
Bubba ^_^;-;Counter-Strike : Global Offensive is a MUST HAVE for all FPS enthusiasts. At the pinnacle of FPS games on PC, CS:GO follows in the footsteps of its predecessors: the game combines the series large skill ceiling with game-modes for all types of players. Want to get your competitive spirit on? Play Competitive a game-mode that pits two team of 5 players against each other on some of the best maps in FPS history , or just play: Casual , Arms Race (Gun Game), or Demolition and have fun! CS:GO is updated often and operations drop around every 4-6 months, so there will never be a shortage of content for this game. Oh, and did I mention weapon finishes ?
(ALF);-;RUSH B WTF PURPLE GO B AUTO SNIPER CAMPER ON LADDER NOOB TEAM GUYS COME ON I CANT HEAR FOOTSTEPS SHUT UP OK THIS TIME WE ALL GO RAMP PURPLE WTF DONT GO ON SILO IM DONE *Refunds*  BLYAT!
QuirkY(CSGO TRADING);-;Get ready for hackers, trollers, derankers, smurfs, ragers, s and more ragers. Besides that a fun game for the whole family. You can waste your money on worthless skins then bet them to win or lose. Ty CSGO Lounge. But still great game, definitely should buy! Also a lot of enjoyable comments by people who enjoy raging and clearly have something wrong in their lives. :) "You are so ing , go get a life." 10/10
VSAG;-;It's worth the money,since it is 75% off
Morty;-;Really good game, about tactics and how to place ur aim and move ur weapon for less recoil.
Death By Kitten;-;This is a very good game would recommend buying it
Nek O'Mimi;-;Pretty good singleplayer
kleavage;-;'i think CoDs better', said noone ever after playing this game. a must have game on your steam library 10/10
Toylore;-;This game is amazing, I highly recommend it, it runs well on almost any computer.
Hall;-;"#1 tactical FPS of all time." is what you are told about this game, and within a hour of playing it, you'll say the same. Epic.
Creature Chief;-;If I submit a good review, do I get a knife?
Potato-Chan;-;I found out the purpose of why I actually bought this game, to kill chickens. 11/10 Would kill chickens again.
Le Magicien;-;A nice game with such a nice russian players that gonna win all the rounds. If you wanna spend time on having fun with nice guys in both teams this game is for you. In the world of CS:GO and in the world of silver you gonna have great time shooting headshots and going trigger happy.
HummingSamurai;-;A game tipically the "Romeo & Julet" Complex, two sides who hate each other enough to kill, in the end boths side find out that its pointless to fight so they make a game out of killing each other as the generation go by the forget and it turns into the PC VS MAC formula where they hate each other because it bacame a thing and they both benfit, and the need to keep up apperances. If you lucky you can catch them both in the house on Sundays.
TG CLuTcH;-;THIS GAME IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS BACON. AND THAT SAYS ALOT!
Dr.;-;If you are a silver, uninstall. If you are a Gold Nova, try harder. If you are Master Guardian, calm down. If you are Legendary Eagle Master, HOLY . If you are Global teh 1337z, HAVE MY BABIES.
Jakob;-;CS:GO is like drugs. It's fun and games at first, but with time it becomes.. different. It becomes more routine, and becomes one of your few senses of joy rather than just a fun little game.
WatermelonJesus;-;one of best games i've played! i highly suggest you try out this game
basya;-;COD: Children Battlefield: Teenagers Arma: Men CSGO: Followers of Gabe Newell
tiny pidar;-;I blame everyone for hacking It's fun
Hatz;-;Very Nice Game :)
Zynski ~;-;If you're looking for Source with new graphics then don't buy this. If you're looking for CS with a different feel and a more competitive atmosphere whilst maintaining it's community then go right ahead.
JapaneseCartoonsTrading;-;Let me get this started using the 7 non sins 1. The ease of competitive use in this game is amazing. Having a rank system so that you can be placed with people of a similar skill and getting into a game without a 3rd party service. 2.    3. The game is constantly updated 4. Valve actively supports the professional scene 5. The game is balanced 6. The Game is cheap 7. There is no fecal matter smeared around the screen while playing
Chris P Chicken;-;Such an awesome game
FNG Neo;-;Pre ordered for $12.50 valve will never release a game above $20 and Half Life 3 better not be above $20 hehehe anyway you need to play the game to get better and better although they almost made it like Team Fortress 2 when they put in items because alot of people started to care about how they look. The game is fun but it's hard to run it on lan. The game is often on sale sometimes as low as $3.75 It's good to see that Valve has finally created a new game with the source engine they added new guns , effects, new maps it's a new counter strike but unlike call of duty you don't have to pay a rubbish $80. The competitive feature on this game is amazing on how you're sort of ranked based on you're skill level but not really because there is always that "one guy" on you're team, smurfs and hackers. so chase chickens 10/10
InJustiice_;-;Better than Cod xD
vedo;-;i love this game
James;-;I think that 50% of the people who play this game only have three words in there vocabulary: noob, kick and me.
Glowlog;-;It's running away from people with guns, 5/5.
le kwak;-;It's a fun game for sure, but a little bit easy. If you want a real challenge i would recommend Battlefield or Call of Duty.
CattleCow;-;Your team has died, the enemy team are briskly striding around the map; sweat dribbles from your cheek as you carry your battle-scarred Awp. A fellow team player who speaks Russian yaps down his mic at you, the timer is ticking and the bomb has been planted. All 5 of them are camped at B car, you can already witness all of them carrying P90's, and, you thought, it was your time to strike; you run in, vigorously spamming your pistol, but no-avail, you lie dead flat on the ground. Sighting your awp purloined. Your team decides to kick you, and you, have front row seats. This game is absolutely fantastic, although, not for the light-heated, the game is set during our modern day period, around two rivals: counter-terrorists; terrorists, both of them fuel hatred between themselves; waging wars of attrition to see who wins the round (Out of 15), you can also site other game modes: .Casual - For Beginners .Competitive- (I wouldn't recommend playing it first) .Death Match- (An effective way of ranking up) And the two other game modes which people barley care about (Demolition, a competitive clone) and Arms race (Who can hack the best to finish first, sorry for my bad convincing skills) Another worth mentioning is the gambling, yes, thousands are sucked in, and come out with nothing but, but. The right man, at the right place, can achieve a ultra rare skin called a 'knife skin', a costley 300$ and up for each one will lead the lucky gambler to scream and fall out of his chair in delight, waking his mom up at 3 Am.
Nickster;-;Like Call of Duty And Civilization 5 mixed in one game.
King Steef;-;Want to learn russian? Buy it!
Rick;-;-It has the unique FPS style that no other FPS games have, It will get you to comeback and play it over and over again - Very competitive, and fun to collect skins and trade with other - Full of russians, Which let you know all about your mother's sexual relationship history - Very educational, You can learn russian in a week -  blyat Cons: - smurfs - smurfs - smurfs Overall: 10/10
PsychicLemon;-;Some background information: Counter-Strike : Global Offensive, abbreviated as CS:GO, It is the third game in the series, after Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike : Source. It is a team-based tactical shooter. Let's get down to it. This is not a game for people who merely wish to rack up immense kills, or boast about their three-sixty no scope headshot wallbang, because this is no CoD. This is a team-based, tactical shooter with many strategies and jargon. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not your average FPS. Game Sense and Skill are very important when it comes to CSGO. What to expect out of particular opponents and the most likely situations you'll be facing is a key part of the game. If you wish to rack up kills, run and gun, and just barge into T spawn guns blazing with no plan, this is not the game for you. Skill is the most important aspect and the most unique aspect of CSGO, and in any Counter-Strike game at that. You will gun, run, and be outgunned, but the most important part is to rise again and to learn from mistakes. How did he get me? What did I do wrong? Someone running around with an M4 and shooting every teammate in the face with a shot to the head does not necessarily mean hacks. Players can always be better (and most of the time will be better) than you, so you need to learn to be better than them. All in all, CSGO is one of the best games I have played. The amount of teamwork and skill here is more than what I have experienced from other team based tactical shooters. In short, if you are looking for a hard to master, easy to play competitive tactical based shooter, pick this game up. It's very much worth it.

I hope you have the same experince when you buy this game.

"Gaben is love" I say, "Gaben is life" My Dad hears me and calls me a . I knew he was just jealous of my devotion to Gaben. I called him a wank. He Hits me and sends me to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed, it's really cold. I feel something warm. It's Gaben! I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear "This is my Knife." He grabs me with his Steamy hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I spread my  cheeks for Gaben. He Slashes my bummy, It hurts so much, but I do it for Gaben. I can feel my butt tearing and my eyes start to water. I push against his cases, I want to please Gaben. He roars a mighty Roar as He fills my butt with love. My dad walks in. Gaben looks him straight in the eye and says, "Hes With The Cases Now." Gaben leaves through my window. Gaben is love. Gaben is life. He f****** forgot to give me my knife :/ 11/10 would have sexual relationships with Gaben again :3 Btw i got banned for 7 days due to kicking "too many" trolls and afk's, would've appreciated a warning :) (God this game is stupid)

RachelSaJ;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is all I look for in a multiplayer first-person shooter. With gamemodes just for fun; arms race, deathmatch, casual, demolition, and gamemodes for those who wish to take the game more seriously and use ranked matchmaking; comepetitive. It is truly a great game, for a great price. I recommend this game to my homies, your homies, your dad, your grandma, hell- even your dog. Buy CS:GO and I don't think you'll be disappointed :)

Creature Chief;-;If I submit a good review, do I get a knife?
Pyromancer;-;Ahh... One of my favorite games. I was never in to CS, I bought CS:S for the Garry's Mod content. And whenever I tried to play it, I would get destroyed, even by bots. I do admit I was terrible at the game, but it really never appealed to me. The day that I got CSGO I went into it with the same mentallity, and opened up a match of office with easy bots. Instantly I noticed the updated graphics, and it looks good to this day. I ran around for a bit and fired off a couple shots with my pistol, then a bot came to try and ruin my day. I fired at him rapidly with my handgun, and he actually died. If that would of been CS:S, my brain would of been merged with the wall and I would of been looking at the bots on my team walk into walls. Suprised with myself, I carried on and made it to the second round alive. I opened up the buy menu, to find out the MP5 had been replaced (rip neva 4get) with the MP7. I bought it and looked for some bots to murder, I managed to kill 2 of them before getting shot in the back with a shotgun. While I groaned at myself for dying and having to wait for the remaining bots to duke it out, I noticed that you could take control of the bots and play as them. I was very happy with this feature at the time, and I am still happy with it now. After getting used to the recoil and spray patterns, I saw a gametype called competive, and I applied to a match of it. It was on de_dust2, and I got a couple of kills by luck with my trusty MP7. I was amazed by how noob friendly the game was, and how it had matched me with people of similar skill levels. After that match, I decided to go again. And again. And again. If you are looking to get into a competive shooter that is mostly* skill based. get this game. Also it can go for really cheap in sales. Thanks for reading. -Pyro *the p90 exists
Zuzu;-;I bought this game and now i have a fluent Spanish 10/10 comprara otra vez jajajaja
Honoguma;-;Counter-Strike is a very nice and sexy competitive game that will role on the steam top sells list for years to come mostly because its something in it for everyone. stuff like you can run around killing chickens and not have a care in the world or play a game of competitive game with your pals and Russian people on the internet. (ByTheWay) all Russians are not idiots only a hand full of then. 9/11 its worte the money if you like the competitive spektrum :p I finally got my first knife on may 28 Gut knife | rust coat :D #goodbirthday :p
ciiDz;-;English: An improvement on a classic. What more could you want? However this game does have its fair share of bugs and issues. :    .              .
Black Tiger Sex Machine;-;Well, if you're sick of 12 year olds on Call of Duty and you can't deal with the hard core veterans of Battlefield, then CS:GO is not the game for you. I am constantly dealing with Russian 12 year olds, which are like a super version of the common COD 12 year old and you can't understand them! And then there's the hardcore pro players who have never seen the light of day! They are the best, seriously. I have never been called a noob so many times in one sentence! All in all, one of the best FPS's i've ever played! Oh you thought this was a negitive review? Nah! The satisfaction of killing these guys is insanely rewarding!
Brax;-;When my friends tell me they want to buy CS:GO, I always tell them its unlike any other FPS out there. The amount of practice and hours needed to play the game right is truly overwhelming to new players. My friends always say "What are you talking about man, you just run around shooting people" and that mindset is the biggest mistake you can make when trying to learn CS:GO. The things that make this game great and distinguish it from any other FPS are also the things that make players who come in thinking they just bought another Call of Duty quit after their first match saying they wasted their money. You will spend the entire time you're playing this game trying to master recoil and spray control, gain a prolific knowledge of the maps, develop a mind for strategy, learn to communicate effectively as a team, learn grenade positions, learn timing, learn callouts, learn crosshair placement, etc.. The hardest thing for new players to accept is that there is always someone better than you. You must have a humble approach to the game when first starting and be willing to learn from anyone. This is the ultimate FPS and is worth every penny spent on it but just beware that when you buy CS:GO, you're probably signing up for a lot more than you realized...
Axelelelelele;-;pls buy mic before you play game, thanks :) 11/10

Stannis the Mannis;-;I won a game 16-0 and made a kid rage so hard he smashed his keyboard. 10/10 game.
[AG] OvenableSora;-;Wonderful game. One of the best competitive FPS games out there. Matchmaking can be quite awful at times, it has quite a few hackers, and casual is ing horrid, but other than that this game is fun, enjoyable, and stressful.
Zain;-;Love the competitive side of this game, awesome smoke spots, crazy boosts and standing on your friends' heads to get an AWP kill. Oh yes, the jumping scout spots. This game is great, unless you get it and go straight to competitive (Dont do it, DO NOT). But at the same time it sucks, how the community is seen as a bunch of avid gamblers. Between Jackpot, Cases and Betting, thats what most people see CS as these days. other than that, Great game. 11/10 gonna buy again.
i have AWPtism#freealdo;-;i love this game compitaive is amasing love the awp skins and stat track ones if u are getting this i hope u like it like me

Suspicious;-;The only thing better than having great team work, accuracy, and always winning is doing it all with style or with re-skins.
TruckWest[SLO];-;So after 200hr on CS:GO i have my first comment ready. Well it is fast paced which i really love cause you never know where the enemy will be next and fast response is required. You have to train hard to become actually better so be prepared if you buy this game...succes isnt given. If you feel the crossahair isnt suitable to you change right away and try others ( a map on workshop gives you that with no hassle) A good team is necessary if you want to win game because CS is a teamwork game....not a "I go EGO on myself i hope for a shot" but if you want just fun get your friends in a laugh about fails and so on :D And that is basicly it for the good things here but now.... The Matchmaking system is horrible. I recently got banned by 4 russians just because i wasnt speaking theyre language i mean wtf? and Valve responds with; its automatically we cant.....thats crap they could if they wanted to. Smurfs and cheaters that just think they are awesome for beating up other people and OP.....they are douches in every way.....play fair cheaters and smurfs play in your league. The keys are expensive in regards of the full game.....5 keys is one CS:GO copy i think they should be 1 eur at best. All together i still can recommend the game cause i think its fun to play with friends, laugh at the fails and just have a good time :)
(MNI)bananx2;-;that luck when you get knife ^_^ 10/10
DarkCloud;-;Great game and a challenging FPS! Unlike most other FPS's recoil plays a huge factor in this game. The online play is amazing and fun! Overall I reccomend this to anyone looking for a cheap FPS with quality content. Can't go wrong with spending 15$ :)
VSAG;-;It's worth the money,since it is 75% off
FlPn;-;One of the best, good work Valve
FishyQ <3 olofm;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive CS:GO for short it's a sequel for the clasic shooter Counter-strike:source and 1.6 . The game it's still folowing the same core gameplay like in the other games but CS:GO has better hitboxes than the other ones and it's more polished. The game started since 1999 (1.5) and it's still played. this says allot about the reaplay value of this game The game it's skill-based and it's way diffrent than cod or battlefield there are no iron sights beside SG 553 and AUG witch are still haveing allot of recoil. The most famous maps like, de_dust2,De_nuke,de_inferno,Cs_Office,Cs_assault are back and even more balanced that they used to be in 1.6 or source The graphics aren't great but this it's a good thing because in this game you really need high fps if you want to play good at the in-game competitive mode the textures are preaty out-dated but on the other hand shaders and anti-aliasing make the game look great even tough it's runed on a 10 year old engine but masively modified (Source) The game has it's own problems, like on the valve official servers the tick-rate witch it's a very important factor in a multipalayer shoooter game it's 64. still more than bf4's 32 but still not enough . it's perfectly fine if you play casual but on competitive it's going to anoy you if you cleary hit a shot with awp or headshot with ak but then you see you actauly didn't do any damage cause the bullet didn't get registred For it's price the game it's very cheap . 11 euro , 15 dolars the game it's underpriced in my opinion i would give 30$ for it , it's amazeinly fun to play with machine guns on deathmatch servers, or run and kill chickens on inferno while you should defend the bomb site . The big problem with this game on higher skill matchmakeing it's that there are quite allot of cheaters and vac isn't that great. This game it's great game. Underpriced,A lot of fun, you can play it for a long time, and you can get your friends to play too since it's extremly cheap! , you can make money from the in-game economy too! But the problems like tick-rate the cheaters and the fact that sometimes the hitboxes aren't working (very rare) are detucting from it's value. The game get's an 8.8 from me with verdict of a great game. perfect to chill out with your friends while screaming away that you just got an ace or an awesome item from cases. Good luck players!
ElementtHD;-;10/10 would bang if it was human

Nek O'Mimi;-;Pretty good singleplayer
Death By Kitten;-;This is a very good game would recommend buying it
CattleCow;-;Your team has died, the enemy team are briskly striding around the map; sweat dribbles from your cheek as you carry your battle-scarred Awp. A fellow team player who speaks Russian yaps down his mic at you, the timer is ticking and the bomb has been planted. All 5 of them are camped at B car, you can already witness all of them carrying P90's, and, you thought, it was your time to strike; you run in, vigorously spamming your pistol, but no-avail, you lie dead flat on the ground. Sighting your awp purloined. Your team decides to kick you, and you, have front row seats. This game is absolutely fantastic, although, not for the light-heated, the game is set during our modern day period, around two rivals: counter-terrorists; terrorists, both of them fuel hatred between themselves; waging wars of attrition to see who wins the round (Out of 15), you can also site other game modes: .Casual - For Beginners .Competitive- (I wouldn't recommend playing it first) .Death Match- (An effective way of ranking up) And the two other game modes which people barley care about (Demolition, a competitive clone) and Arms race (Who can hack the best to finish first, sorry for my bad convincing skills) Another worth mentioning is the gambling, yes, thousands are sucked in, and come out with nothing but, but. The right man, at the right place, can achieve a ultra rare skin called a 'knife skin', a costley 300$ and up for each one will lead the lucky gambler to scream and fall out of his chair in delight, waking his mom up at 3 Am.
DoughNads;-;I love this game. I play it every ing day. I play it alot. I love this game. I play too much.
ObeyUs Blitzz;-;HATE THE UNBOXING, IT CAN SUCK MY BALLS  YOU GABEN
GeT_RiGhT;-;Amazing game, gets some time to get used to, but awesome with friends. No singleplayer, but that doesn't deter from the experience.
Fapoleon;-;The more expensive language learning tool, if you wanna learn Russian, Polish, Ukranian or any eastern european language fast and easy, whilst having fun, then this is the game for you. /10
DrTomahawk;-;Very Good Games
Fluffy unicorn;-;It took my money and gave me a red and black assult rifle.
le kwak;-;It's a fun game for sure, but a little bit easy. If you want a real challenge i would recommend Battlefield or Call of Duty.
Pimp Doge;-;Best shooter ever, nice tactics, much wow.
Glowlog;-;It's running away from people with guns, 5/5.
Langweenee (Actually Jaraxxus);-;I've flashed myself in-game enough that I'm blind IRL now. 10/10
Potato-Chan;-;I found out the purpose of why I actually bought this game, to kill chickens. 11/10 Would kill chickens again.
Le Magicien;-;A nice game with such a nice russian players that gonna win all the rounds. If you wanna spend time on having fun with nice guys in both teams this game is for you. In the world of CS:GO and in the world of silver you gonna have great time shooting headshots and going trigger happy.
HummingSamurai;-;A game tipically the "Romeo & Julet" Complex, two sides who hate each other enough to kill, in the end boths side find out that its pointless to fight so they make a game out of killing each other as the generation go by the forget and it turns into the PC VS MAC formula where they hate each other because it bacame a thing and they both benfit, and the need to keep up apperances. If you lucky you can catch them both in the house on Sundays.
MrMeow;-;The best game in the world
WatermelonJesus;-;one of best games i've played! i highly suggest you try out this game
PanzerSchmit;-;So after 3 hours of playing with 'suka blyat' friends my russian is so fluent. CCCP/10
basya;-;COD: Children Battlefield: Teenagers Arma: Men CSGO: Followers of Gabe Newell
Liquidum;-;There are more smurfs then actual silver I
Icars;-;The game is really hooking, really satisfying and as the price is fine it is worth it totally. This is also one of Gabens most vicious way to secretly take your money without noticing. You will once or twice add funds to your wallet, then you stop to think about it, and realize how much you've spent. Next moment you find yourself opening yet again a new case, and with Gaben looking behind your shoulder, once again you get nothing from it. If you have an addiction of gambling, I highly recommend this game.
Rekle$$;-;One of the fastest growing eSports around, and it's not hard to see why. Pros: -Learning curve forces improvement -Casual based and competitive based game modes -Huge community -Personalise your inventory with weapon skins Cons: -Matchmaking is rather broken (64 tick servers) -Many toxic players -Steep learning curve (for some) -Hackers galore in matchmaking, beware. All in all, there are 3rd party clients that can provide a solid competitive experience, such as FACEIT . It's a solid game with no real flaws, apart from the community. Why not give it a shot?
MarshallareN // #GONINJAS<3;-;1 of the best shootergames out there
NiEkSaS;-;Everyone has to smoke mid at least one time in their lives. Recommended to all :3
:(;-;A bit of a mixed review- Its a great game no doubt! If your already ranked in competitive! If your new to the game beware of the 2 win 24 Hour CoolDown, Until you get 10 Wins. & the In general cooldown system is a bit off. Other than those this is a great game!
Popsiclz;-;This is the best First Person Shooter I have played.
'Hunter;-;Best competitive shooter, period. Smurfs make the rank advancement hard but if you invest time in the game you're going to reach the higher ranks and if you are aware of self-criticism you can learn a thing or 2 from those s. And don't buy keys its just not worth it. If you want a knife, buy a knife, that will be way cheaper than gambling on open cases,

MrGreen;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive Review Overview Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO or GO for short) is an online tactical and first-person shooter. The aim of the game depends on the game mode. Game modes consist of modes like Demolition and Hostage Rescue. Modes In Demolition, the Terrorists (T for short) have to plant a bomb at one of two sites, Site A or Site B. The Counter-Terrorists (CT for short) have to stop the Terrorists by erradicating the enemy team. Each player starts off with a standard pistol and $800, which they can buy other weapons and gear with. As you progress through the game, winning or losing, you gain more cash to get bigger and better weapons. The first to win 16 rounds wins. In Hostage Rescue, the Terrorists most "protect" the hostages from the Counter-Terrorists while the Counter-Terrorists must take the hostages to the evac zone marked in green on the minimap. If either team erradicates the other, they win. In Casual, your rank is not affected by your wins/loses. Other modes, like surfing and "Cas Team Deathmatch" are in here. Ranks Catagory Score Statement Gameplay 9 Gameplay is fun and quick, however, it can get really intense at times, making it more fun! Graphics 7 Graphics are a plus for this addition to the Counter-Strike series. It is a very good looking game to play in. Teamwork 9 Teamwork is esential in this game, otherwise, the game is ruined.

Vilmos;-;You will find this game very hard after you play games like Battlefield and/or Call of Duty. If you are a competitive player this game is right for you. This game requires you to to communicate with your team in order for your team to win the round.
JeffOx;-;Perhaps the best game you can play for a long time and have never regretted that money spent on it, because selling items from her I paid for it in time 20

ProvenciO#GoneFor5Days-OnHoliday;-;Don't buy this game if you plan on seeing the sun again.
UserU;-;The feeling is different from the other Counter-Strikes, but the formula is still the same. With a variety of pre-defined T/ CT factions and skins on the Market, you don't always have to download them since they're yours to keep.

Hypocrite;-;The campagn is way to short and the multiplayer sucks, because the bullets just go everywhere. How am I supposed to hit anything like that? Also for some reason my killstreaks didn't work and when I finally got a level-up to silver 2 I didn't get any new weapons. Why would I play a game where I can't unlock anything better? How am I supposed to kill those stupid noobs who didn't play the game nearly as long as I did, if I don't have better weapons than them? Don't buy this game, it's just a broken Call of Duty copy without any tactical elements and rewards for playing this game for a long time. 3/10

chiken;-;Good players and hackers
JTRettore AEDA CHOKE! CGC;-;well it seems to be interesting, but idk really, didn't play dat much
loading;-;I learned russian in two weeks 10/10
PingviiniHirvi;-;I tried the game, it's okay, but competetive matchmaking doesn't allow you to play with your friends if they have been randomly chosen to have a better rank than you unless you have 5 friends that you can get to play at the same time. If you play the game in europe, you'll learn fluent russian in one month. It would be a nice game to play as a team, but when there is one guy shouting in polish, two in russian and two in english it's kind of hard to play, but don't worry, once you'll learn the russian language the game becomes playable.
TheNoobDealer;-;Before playing CS:GO - " Who tf would pay $300 for a virtual knife " After playing CS:GO - " I'm gonna spend my Christmas money on a knife! " On a more serious note, I really liked the game and have invested many hours into it ( 38 hrs in the past 2 weeks and I can only play on weekends, including Fridays, so basically I've spent about a third of my weekend, if the math adds up, this past 2 weeks on CS:GO ). I find it really fun to play, I'd just say if its you're very first time palying CS:GO on PC, don't head straight into competitive. I played CS:GO on the XBOX since it was released and was decent at it so I thought it would also apply to PC, but I wasn't accustomed to the mouse and keyboard, and lost a bunch of games in competitive and after my 10 wins I got placed in silver. However, I am getting the hang of it now, and am pretty much top-fragging everygame, just got promoted recently, and pretty much I'm aiming to climb to nova during winter break. Past experiences with this series. As said before I've played it CS:GO on the XBOX. I've also played the original CS and CS:CZ, but I've never touched source before. I'd make a comparison but I was really young when I played this so it wouldn't be very accurate. Community-wise, I haven't ran into many toxic players. Most people are willing to communicate and are pretty nice. This game does have its share of "12 year olds" and people who like to constantly talk to the fact that you can't concentrate, but that is very small, I rarely meet any of these "bad" people. I'd also say that from my point of view, the game is pretty balanced between the 2 sides, I mean sure the T AK is 1 hit headshot ( oh yeah aim for headshots, ight be hard at first but you'll quickly get the hang of it ) while, the CT M4 is 2, you've got to remember that CT's are usually the ones defending, you actually have to get that headshot, you can always pick up an AK from a dead T and you switch sides at 15 rounds, and unless you're 0:15 it should even out. tl;dr My overall rating of the game 10/10, really enjoyed palying it and will continue to do so
Zeores;-;Randomly spray and pray with Negev on 3 enemies, headshot in 3 row, and people calling me hacker. 10/10 Would spray with Negev again.
Kawaii Hitler ();-;This game is better then sex
twitch.tv/theheadcreep;-;One of the best FPS of all time.
SuperFat Guy;-;Lately I am playing al lot of Counter Strike Global Offensive, sometimes it sucks really,really hard but I can't stop playing it. I don't no why I am still playing this. The game is really popular in our Community maybe because even cheap PCs can run it without lags and other problems. The Graphics are ok, but this game isn't about graphics at all. It's about Skill, Experience, Tactics and the most important:Teamwork. This is what makes the game soo difficult too :)
John Cena;-;uR my gurd this is like the best freaking game ever i think i might have a gambling addiction but who the  cares?
Falsedeath;-;So I'm going to keep this short and sweet. This game pisses me off so much, but it also gives me the most satisfaction from any FPS I have ever played. 9/10 cause the people suck.
Revo;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the best, maybe even the best shooter at the moment. I used to play Call of Duty a couple years ago but friends convinced me to play CS:GO and I don't regret it! It offers a good gameplay, a decent difficulty and a large playerbase. You need good aim, movement and the social ability to play in a team. The game offers a matchmaking system and different gamemodes to play. - Competitive Matchmaking -> Queue up alone or with up to 5 people to compete against other players on your rank. - Deathmatch -> Grab a gun and kill the enemy. If you die, you respawn. The player with the most points in the end wins - Arms Race -> Kill enemys to gain new weapons and finish your streak and the game with a golden knife kill. - Demolition -> A mixture of the "Bomb Scenario" and Arms Race. Plant or Defuse the bomb and gain new weapons by killing enemys. - Custom Serverbrowser -> like in every other Counter-Strike game. Competitive Matchmaking is the way, the game is meant to be played. Two teams compete at each other and play a best of 30 rounds Bomb or Hostage scenario. Both teams will play as CT and T during the match. Counter-Terrorists: - Defend the bombside, rescue the hostages and/or kill the terrorists Terrorists: - Plant the bomb, defend the hostages and/or kill the counter-terrorists within the timelimit Whenever you play Counter-Strike keep in mind, that this game is no game for "I only care about myself plebs". Even if you manage to get some good shots and get a round by yourself, you usually screw your team and lose more rounds by not playing with your team. Unfortunately there are many people in this game who play like this. Either they don't talk, get mad once you lose a couple rounds or perhaps even insult you in a language you never heard of before. You can get lucky and get decent to even nice teammates but when you queue alone it is like playing "Russian Roulette". *warning joke inc.* Pro: - good gameplay - decent difficulty - serverbrowser - competitive matchmaking - large playerbase Con: - Cheaters/smurfs here and there - harsh learning curve - many unfriendly players I advise you to buy this game if you are interested in a very good FPS Shooter with very active playerbase. I hope this review helped you in any way and would really like to see you ingame!

Get_Right G2A;-;I never knew How many kids slept with mom until I bought this game.
BloodyWolfey;-;Best game available on Steam! Why?! DONT ASK, JUST BUY! Pro: CSGO is just the best shooter in my opinion. Okay, the graphics ain't as good as the graphics of some newer titles but CS was never meant to have the best graphics. CS is about skill, about getting better, about training and about INHUMAN REACTIONS! Eh, nevermind.. Let's just go on... Without training you won't reach anything in this game. And thats why it's nice - there is actually some challenge! Basically, it's just a competetive shooter for those who want to play a game where you have to aim yourself (that's what you use the mouse for) and which isn't actually a console game! If you don't like that then don't cry - the next CoD is almost released now: CoD Xtreme Super Warfare III. Now extra casual! Contra: There is a lot they should be fixing in terms of MatchMaking. Like upgrading their servers to 128 tick etc. And no, I don't hate you cause you're playing CoD. We just can't be friends any more! ;D
Petr Cech;-;I ed this game right in the p[ussy
GreenPerson;-;As far as FPS goes, this is the best. I had never played the original counter strike, or source, but heard many good things about it. If you are looking for a game which requires solid teamwork, rather than solo play, then this is for you. And the best part is, you learn plenty of Russian swear words.
Sypher(Syn.Co);-;This game is pretty damn awesome. It's purely multiplayer based, so if u don't have good internet connection, DO NOT GET THIS GAME. If u fall into category 2 (have good internet connection) I wholeheartedly reccommend this game. Great graphics, gameplay, and generally never laggy. Many different modes to play (I personally like the arms race and classic modes) and a whole hell of a lot of strategy needed. 1st game that I award a 10/10, I love this game.
Slugger;-;I like to play this game, and imagine that the people I play with are my friends. It makes me feel less lonely and depressed, and gives me something to look forward to, when I get home from working in the coal mines.

uW | Robbie;-;This game is amazing... not ever FPS game can match its physics, match its teamwork cooperation inorder to win. If you dont have teamwork, you wont win. This makes it a growing game for not only itself but for the community. The maps and game in general is voted on and based off the CS:GO community thoughts, that results in less complaints and better gameplay. They even have a workshop for you to creat your ideas and submit them! this game is absulutly amazing.
[2DL] The Situation Greddygoon;-;I've played bad games and this isnt one of them.
CHINS CENA IS A MILLIONER;-;Na'Vi. But besides that it's 10/10
Sehen;-;At first I was hesitant about purchasing Counter-strike, i'd heard of it's lack of ADS, and didn't know if I could possibly get into it, but when I saw it go on sale I decided to grab it, and holy balls it's worth every penny, I started logging hours into Casual and got to grips with the hip-firing, but I knew I needed a real challenge, so I decided to try out Competitive, 100 percent team based, you WILL lose if you don't communicate with your team which I absolutely adore, the only problem I have with the game is the slight smurf and cheating problems that come with all games, but it's quite rare (for me atleast) to get into a server with a smurf or cheater (for those of you who don't know, a smurf is a highly skilled player creating alternate steam accounts to decimate lower ranks in Competitive,) other than that, it's a truly flawless FPS that I highly recommend any PvP fans purchase immediately!
pretty juiceman;-;Let's start off by saying this game is the best one in the CS series. I'd say that CS:GO is a remade version of 1.6, which suits the needs of the current generation - better graphics, stuff is fancy. There is also this gambling aspect of opening cases and betting skins. I really do not know if I like it or not. Some kids get happy over their new stuff while the other kids are crying after losing their whole skin collection in one click. Now, the game itself. There's a new "mode" called competitive. People take this rather seriously. You can play it to get higher in rank - in case you've got what it needs to get there, which means you'll get better opponents when you advance. Remember that you have to be on the same (or higher!) level as your opponents to get higher. You can also play it to realize you belong to the bottom floor. But being on the bottom floor is okay, right? You can only get better. Note: Remember this is a team game. Try to co-operate with your team the best as you can. Of course CS:GO also has the classic server browser, wherein you can browse the servers, search them by tags/maps/player count/ping, regular stuff. Some of these servers also feature funmodes, which you can play when you feel like playing CS:GO but you CBA to tryhard. Most of those servers are noob-friendly. This game is updated constantly, which means tweaks to guns if some are deemed 'overpowered' or 'underpowered', new skins, new operations, new maps, and more. Be sure to have your credit card ready when these things happen, though!
MOKCEM. * Kinguin;-;In this game, you can learn russian language from cover to cover.
720mlgslowscope;-;This is a wonderful and challenging game! learning the recoil patterns is really fun! Also the skins are just so cool! I'd definiatly recommend this for anyone.

<<>>;-;Its good
Kirito! | DirtyBomb Cobalt Dream;-;This game is: 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain 100% reason to purchase this game
DJ Keydude;-;As you can see the amount of hours of my life wasted here. I've lost my social life, my money I've "invested" and hell even my family in this. Get it if your willing to take the risk.
Ahri-chan <3;-;I would say this game is pretty awesome, since its more "realistic" than bf or cod, when you shoot somebody in the head (with a proper weapon) they die unlike in some other games, recoil is pretty realistic for each weapon like the ak, compare the recoils of cs and cod and u will smell , on which one is up to you. Also its more community friendly and is good linked with steam with the community market n stuff, the idea with adding skin made by people using steam is pretty sweet too. In fact i like everything about this game expect that u instantly get called bljat by joining comp :3
_Pixel Maiden_;-;t is a good game, fun, exciting and a good way to make new friends
SilliBird;-;i may suck at this game, but boy is there is a rush when you destroy another twelve year old.
Red^Shadow *;-;Ahhh, i'm getting addicted to the game :D
drag0nFTW;-;Best Shooter GAME !!!
dropped my doritos;-;Played this game for 2 years, its all payed off Passed my Russian exam Realised my mums a pimp and been ed by multiple 10 year old polish kids Practised my bomb planting skills for the ISIS tryouts, made the team :D 10/10 would purchase
ivalin.chobanov;-;Nice tactical game!
OhsHiasTheres - Trding BayoFade;-;Threw a grenade and it bounced off my teamate, 7 day cooldown 10/10 Would throw again For realz here, it's a great game but the cooldown is stupid. 7 days is ridiculous. +Smurfs, cheaters, toxic community, and more terrible things. I still love this game to death. Edit: This game has now consumed my life. I spend all my days trading and buying skins. reking scrubs and still staying in s4 (yay im nova 3 (mg), can't call me a silver scrub fgts) with my dank 700 (1,000) hours. I sold my wife and kids for skins. Gaben... Please..
Snipercorp;-;Got insulted by 9 year old russian kid. Best experience ever, 10/10 would get insulted again (y)

Bluesteel #AbleGamers;-;2300 hours. Why do I even buy other steam games?
Hestia;-;Chickens blow up. enough of a reason to buy this game
Tumb;-;Probs my fave game
wswester;-;If Cocaine did Cocaine, it would be no where near to how addictive this exellectly executed first-person-shooter is. Great maps, a competetive community, and collectables such as in-game-skins make this gem even better. I've played both Ghosts and Battlefield 4 and honestly I don't think they have the competitive capabilities, replayability, or friendly community of this game. Outside the game there are professional teams that are both incredibly entertaining and extrodinarily insightful. So many styles can be exploited in game, whether you're defensive and like to let the enemies come to you (AWP) or you like to flashbang your way in, then spray a hundred bullets like a true God of War (Negev), there's no wrong way to play the game. CS:GO is one of the games I will be playing into the next decade and well beyond that. 10/10 Would Reccommend
Hitman;-;CS:O is a game that"ll always make you come back for more . Apart from it's already renowed gameplay generations have been playing , CS : GO brings new features to the franchise : Pros : -The key to victory is TEAMPLAY ( rare those days ) -Great matchmaking system -New recoil system add depth and more challenge during firefights , every bullet matters -Great community ( till now ) -VAC keep hackers at bay . -Correct graphic engine made to support the biggest range of PCs while staying pretty ( That's why we love Source ) -Workshop : thousands of free maps & skins to support Cons : - Please Valve , fix the matchmaking cooldown system or at least give us more time to reconnect ( we need 5 min , nothing more ! ) some PCs and routers can't restart in the blink of an eye after a power outage , it may make things easier for " quitters " but it"ll also help a lot of honest players being put on cooldown injustly . Otherwise , i recommend this game to anyone who wants a nervous game with an incredible community . Thank you for for this great Game !
Anders Moerk;-;Worth it :3
xDuz;-;Game is loads of fun. Recomended to all, fun to play with friends
Carve;-;I saw a chicken.. I killed said chicken.. Would eat KFC 11/10.
(Sorry for bad english);-;One of the most competitive games I have ever played, while the community is poop garbage and matchmaking is very stupid, you should still pick up this game if you have the competitive spirit. I DON'T recommend this game if you aren't willing to spend hours learning mechanics and practicing spray patterns using and learning the weapons as well as dealing with the mindbogglingly toxic community. ... If you want to learn Russian and German and you don't want to buy Rosetta Stone buy this game, you'll learn them fluently in about 3-5 months, tops.
Bonjour Boy;-;Cool i think i  myself
Wild Card Bitches!;-;Do you want to just play the same 3 maps over and over and over again despite there being many more options? Do you want to sit there for hours corner camping close quarters areas with a sniper rifle that one shots someone even if you only hit their toe? Do YOU want to be constantly berated and told how you got #rekt by a community with a combined IQ of 10? If you answered yes to one or more of these questions then do not hesitate to buy this amazing game. Lose your mind as well as your shame as you slowly become just another part of the problem.

Soggy Crackers;-;This game taught me what ever team is winning is hacking.
Snasket;-;A great addition to the Counter-Strike series. Filled with many servers, players; old and new and the competitiveness of the people is just overwhelming. The game welcomes any player; beginner or veteran. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes strategic plays, positioning and a game takes incredible aiming and reaction speeds to beat your opponents.
leAKlife;-;This is the best game I've ever played and since I discovered it, I don't play other games anymore.
ammo;-;Counter-Strike: Russian Offensive Language, is a FPS-game where you kill other players while learning how to speak russian! These friendly russian players will teach you how to speak their language really fast! Their mics are also of the highest quality so don't worry about headaches or bleeding ears! If you need your fellow russians to answer you, open chat and write " blyat ruskis" for instant reaction! A hilarious one at that! (WARNING: Your experience may vary!)

WAKAWAKA;-;Counter-Strike GO is great fun while still introducing strong elements of strategy. Or perhaps it is fun because of the strategy. While this game is not for everyone I would DEFINITELEY reccomend checking it out, espicially with the new refund system valve has introduced. CS-GO is one of the few tactical shooters out there. some people might say Ghost Recon Phantoms is tactical because you get bonus's for being near your team or something. CS-GO is tactical because if your team isn't coordinating but the other team is it doesn't matter how good YOU are, you will lose. I don't know if it will be this way for you but each game feels crucial in CS-GO when the other team wins I actully feel a little depressed; but when we win I feel amazing. I have yet to find something in life than a 1v1 with bomb down, ~20 seconds left, no kit. You have to go NOW...

Papadonut;-;Love this game <3
Bronze;-;It's an OK game, better than CS:CZ in my opinion (which I previously played in an old account, before switching to CS:GO). You get connected to matches in less than 10 seconds, and server quality is overall acceptable. The maps, weapon balance (except AWP, AK-47 and P90), skins, etc are all OK. What I don't like about CS:GO is the horrible community (especially mic chat). It's full of raging morons and smurfs, who expect that you can do everything. If you can't, they try to kick you (which fails most the time, unless you're Silver 1). There are too many smurfs in the game and Valve still hasn't created a solution for it. When in sale, the game also becomes full of hackers/cheaters, which is a massive nuisance. Unfortunately, CS:GO suffers from many glitches and poor optimization. Online gameplay is fragile with Wi-Fi, unlike other games. The "could not retrieve your inventory" bug also annoys me a lot. CS:GO isn't beginner-friendly. Although there are many players who aren't smurfs, many of them are playing CS for at least 5 years or more (Veteran Coin). This makes CS:GO very difficult for new players, if worse, even impossible to play. The "tutorial" is very half-, and doesn't even explain the important basics of CS:GO well. Final Rating: 6.5/10.0
DSPhat;-;After playing over 190 hours of this game I suppose I'd better give a review for it. The gameplay of this game is extraordinary - the whole game is, like all Counter-Strike games, completely multi-player, meaning that the Valve team can spend 100% of their time working on the game and making it run fine, instead of faffing around with a single-player campaign 5% of players will bother to play past the first level. The community, however... it's terrible. But if you just realise that this is a $15US game, don't really take any offense to the little kids, they're everywhere (but more so on Call of Duty). To summarize, this game's excellent, buy it. Now.

peetyN;-;you can actuly earn money from playing and trading :)
loori;-;Read the original version here [textuploader.com] . What I said in the previous version of this review was a bit too harsh. Like I've said before, this game is amazing. However, what breaks the game for many people is Valve's silly anti-cheating measures and decisions in addition to their laziness in fixing even the simplest of things. Besides that, we've had no real gameplay update in a very long time - apart from new operations, which aren't even made by Valve. Again, in its core, CS:GO is a masterpiece of a game, without a doubt. It plays great and it has incredible amounts of depth while only making use of simplistic mechanics. It has the potential to be the biggest eSports title, surpassing the MOBA genre even, with its catering towards both casual and competetive players. What the game is suffering from right now, however, is catering too much towards casual players and not paying attention to competetive players's wishes and to the competetive community altogether. VAC hasn't still been improved and despite many complaints, it still has questionable features such as banning people in waves. More about that and the rest of the anti-cheating measures in a minute. Besides that, CS:GO is plagued with small, easy-to-fix issues. A few, brief examples: - Weapon balancing - Character/object models being smaller than their hitboxes or vice versa (see Mirage A triplestack or Dust CT character models.) - Hitboxes in general (jumping, ladder and plant hitboxes are waaaaay off, see this and this ) - Competetive matchmaking servers being 64 tick instead of 128 - Hit detection ..and many more. As you can see by the upload dates on the videos, these issues have been apparent for almost a year, if not more. This shouldn't be happening to a very popular game made by a very successful company. After plentiful complaints made by the community, Valve has not yet commented on the issues. This highlights another issue - Valve's inability to listen and communicate. There is no excuse to this, as this hasn't always been an issue. They listened back when CS:GO was just a shadow of what it is today because the game wasn't selling. That is no longer the case. I think the reason for Valve's laziness is the fact that there's nothing that can compete with Global Offensive right now. Most of the PC FPS players are drawn over to CS:GO simply because there are not many other games they can play right now. Dota 2 gets clearly a lot more attention because it has 3 major competetitors as of right now. I can't say for sure, but it makes a lot of sense. Moving on. I have a friend that is a private cheats developer and has a lot of experience in making them - he doesn't make them because he thinks it's not morally wrong or whatever, but literally just to make money, as these things cost a lot of money - selling private, personal cheats pay about 500-800 dollars. I don't fully agree with his decisions. However, I'd like to say that neither of us condone cheating in any way. He has helped me in writing of this by giving me a more in-depth look at how they work. Most of the following are based on his answers. In a game with a competetive aspect or a competetive environment such as the official matchmaking servers, cheating cannot by any means be an issue and should be kept very minimal. Yes, no game is hack- or cheatproof. It is not possible to make such a system that keeps all the cheaters in check. But for a game of this size, cheating shouldn't be as big of a problem as it is now. VAC is terrible - and Valve is aware of it and they showcase it by creating in-game anti-cheat solutions that potentially break the game for legitimate players. Here's an example. One of these anti-cheat "solutions", as seen in the above video, works by having the server create a trace between a player and other players' heads. If for whatever reason this trace is not finished or gets abrupted, the enemy is not rendered on your computer. It's especially bad if the other player's ping is high, as the information received from the server takes longer to reach the client. This fix is only mildly effective, but it should help prevent wallhacking. However, it also affects legitimate players, like the video showcased. redacted: it doesn't break wallhacks completely redacted: for example if i'm on cat redacted: i could still see a guy on goose redacted: but i couldn't see a guy from CT spawn to T spawn (anymore) Another one of these " solutions [images.akamai.steamusercontent.com] " is unsynchronized weapon spread between the client and the server. In the picture above, red is what your client sees and blue is what the server sees. Ever shoot a whole magazine at someone and see all the bullets hitting directly behind them but only get a few hits? That happens because of this. This was implemented to prevent ragehackers, when in reality, it doesn't prevent ragehackers ability to continue ragehacking in anyway. These aren't the only ones, there are a dozen more and they only barely hurt the cheaters while hurting the legitimate players just as much. These aren't solutions, these are lazy changes which are called fixes when in reality they don't make the situation any better. If VAC were any better and could actually detect cheats with a bit more finesse, these counter-measures wouldn't be needed at all. If ESEA, a third party matchmaking service, can have a fairly decent anti-cheat, so can Valve. Now that we've established how poor VAC is, let's talk about the problems caused by cheating itself. In my opinion, the worst part about having a game with so many cheaters running rampant and so many cheats available, is having to contemplate if someone is cheating or not. It's absolutely disgusting to be forced to sit in a game for atleast 30 minutes and watch your team get slaughtered every round because of a blatant cheater, but it's even more terrible to play a game where you're not sure if the other team had some kind of external help. It's discouraging. It's not fun to wait for the game to end and get frustrated so that you don't want to play anymore, because, as I've said before, you're essentially playing a gamble when you queue up. All you can do is hope that you don't get cheaters in your game. Leaving is not an option, unless you want to get a temporary matchmaking ban. Having a surrender option available at all times would make this a lot better. Cheating is ruining competetive matchmaking, and Valve hasn't taken many steps to remedy that problem. If you wish to play competetively, your best bet would be third party matchmaking services, unfortunately. However, as bad as all of this may sound, most of these issues can be ignored especially if you're not huge into playing competetively. The game is still balanced around the fact that both players have the ability to do what the other team is doing because of the side-switching system at half-time - honestly, the only issues besides cheating that you'll be in contact with are hitbox and hit registering errors. The game is still a lot of fun, especially if you have friends you can play with. I don't regret any of the 1000 hours I've played this game with my friends, because they have all been memorable and very entertaining. To say that the game is flawless or the best FPS ever made would be silly, however. All in all, buy it. Regardless of the issues with the game. I would. It's cheap, and there is nothing else like it, so you don't have much choice anyway. Just be aware of the fact that there's 0% chance that Valve is going to fix any of the issues with the game until there's something to compete with their game.
dJ;-;CSGO is a fantasy game about a young Scottish man in the Middle-East. Your goal is to clear the land of Russians and anyone else who is foreign. You have a large arsenal of guns also known as the AK-47, M4A1/4 and the AWP, all other guns require a large ammount of RGN, which is very Silver. The AK47 is a terrorist weapon used by the Russians, usually missing all shots and screaming "ING NOOB YOU LET MY DIE ". The way you respond to this is by holding TAB, right clicking their name and pressing "Block Communication". The AWP is a large bolt-action rifle used to take out enemies from a far. The M4A1/4 are used by the Counter-Terrorist team and are incredibly accurate. All in all a fun game but if there were less Russians it would be 10/10. -My review 6/9 not enough water.
Public Enemy;-;Counter-Strike is like an abusive husband...it s you up and ruins your life...but you keep coming back.

BJ Cox;-;How to be a Counter Strike pro: 1. Buy a ridiculously overpriced Alienware PC with a stupidly powerful CPU and a GPU from the 1990's 2. Buy the most expensive Razer keyboard and mouse cos y'know razer is the best brand 3. Buy a ridiculously large mouse mat (preferably razer) 4. Set your mouse DPI to the highest it can be and set your in-game sensitivity to the max 5. Be totally oblivious to the fact that although your fps counter says you are getting 3000FPS you are in fact only seeing 50 because you're using your dad's old, 19 inch TV screen 6. When in game buy a P90 and run straight down mid 7. See an enemy. Spin around ridiculously fast and spray wildly because your sensitivity is too high 8. Die. Swear and insult teammates for not covering you. 9. Repeat from step 6 For added effect play on the lowest graphical settings and repeatedly switch weapons and wiggle your crosshair about because that's what KennyS / JW / Olofmeister do 11/10 - would be called a "in nub" by angry Russian kids again

OsamaUniQ;-;This is like the best game out there, you get the thrill of playing the game, its so much fun while playing with your friends.

Jim Bob the LowPrio Master;-;My mom asked me to put some pizzas in the fridge. I meant to ask "which one" because we have 2 freezers, one upstairs and one downstairs. Instead I said "bombsite a or b" In all seriousness, this is an awesome game. I may not have much time on it, but I LOVE it.

Sabdab;-;This game is the bext First-Person Shooter I have ever played. Spend about 200 hours just playing Casual Hostage Rescue games, Casual Bomb defuse games, and Competitive Matches. But I also just found out about something not too long ago, the community server listings. People can make their own modded games like surf servers and Jail Break servers. Realistic graphics and effects (favorite would have to be dropping your clip when you reload). This game has upped my sense of competitiveness and sportsmanship in my life, and I will never be bored again.
Prop3R;-;Spent almost 100 EUR on this game, lost over 200 EUR on csgolounge, spent almost 3000hrs on this game thats about 2 and a half months played nonstop or basicly little over year (if you play everyday about 8 hrs), learned many different languages like russian, polish, spanish, swedish, and better english, destroyed many nerves, made a lot of frag movies, and lost a lot from my social life. Or basicly 1 year wasted of my life, and fair amount of money in skins. But i will still play... ...Because... ..You can never stop. 10/10
Barry Allen;-;Buy a Pro90 and win. 10/10
Tyson Storm;-;"Beaut Force". Makes you wanna play it even on 40-50 FPS. Recommended for anyone who loves the CS series and wants to go HD in style. You may lag like a ragdoll with your crosshair feeling sluggish and slacking/flopping about your enemies, but nonetheless, this game will keep you begging and grinding your teeth and sneakily out-stretching your hand towards that cash you had saved up for your sister's wedding but always wanted to use on updating to that shiny new GPU. The new Arms Race+Demolition, Competitive, and Deathmatch [enabled by default] are great mods added at default functionality. And funny seeing the bots; they actually do seem like they have a vague impression of what is happening! 11/10 CS1.6 users would shut the door the moment they first open the game. If you know what I mean.

Assureddoge;-;Everyone has this game already, if you're thinking of buying it, JUST DO IT. Yesterday, you said Tomorrow. So, just, DO IT. Don't let your dreams be dreams. Just... DOOOO IT, and lose all of your money on gambling websites and opening cases, then once you get to a high rank there are cheaters in every other game, your only solution is to open more cases in hope of getting something good to pull you out of your spiraling depression after losing all your skins and hope of ranking up. Enjoy counter strike.

This is also the game for you because there is so much lag that teleports people everywhere and teleports people back where they were. Also if u like this game that has annoying  that boss u around so much go ahead and play this game waste your money. If you like a game when ur crosshair is on their heads and u shoot but no headshot DAFUQ???? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!!!!!! BUT this is not why people play this game this a game where you play with friends,and hangout yeah its the internet people hangout with people who they don't know on the internet.

Lonesome Lizard;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

nightemon;-;CS:GO is strange cross between old school gameplay and new school mechanics. It's not a mere run and gun game, you need to play tactically and slowly for there is a penalty for moving and firing. It is somewhat reminiscent of the gameplay in America's Army, as far as the stop-and-shoot motion goes. Additionally, it will feel a bit familiar to those who played the original Counter Strike, or Tactical Ops: AoT, but is far from a carbon copy. That could be taken eitherway, but for a game that relies on competitive gameplay, you will definitely experience it. My suggestion is to play amongst friends as my experience has been negatively beguiled by mostly a prepubescent and/or immature playerbase. Eitherway, the mute button is your friend in that case, and will make for a more enjoyable experience. The weapon skin drops ala TeamFortress, is a nice addition for those collectors out there, who may be looking for some incentive to play the game more. This game is no Unreal Tournament or Quake 3, but for fans who yearn for an environment of competition, then look no further than Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

thewarrio332;-;I have spent countless hours on the game trying to get better and better opened a lot of cases and got decent weapon skins. When I played it I couldn't stop even if I had to go to bed. The reasons why I stopped playing the game was because of all the hackers in the games on compeitev. Don't get me wrong I still love the game and I still play it about once a week but the hackers are too strong. I would recommend the game but before you start playing you need to get ready to train a lot. The reason why I still recommend it because its really fun and if the casual gamemode isn't enough for you, you can always play deathmatch, arms race and many more different gamemodes.

Lonesome Lizard;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love...

ChimaerA'';-;Counter-Strike Global Offensive is how should i say it's sometimes fun sometimes it's not Well since CS-Source went a bit down and players are shiftting to this next generation of Counter-strike Gaming so this Game is probably the most intense fps game i've played since there are so many of these god damn hackers in the game it hits you hard with rage madness such nerve rackingness & the struggle in some of the games against them my god they are such A HUGE PAIN I'm starting to wonder if Steam supports hackers Vac3 is a complete Joke Overwatch is more of a joke they should put more people on the Watch or Valve should develop a more sophisticated Banning-System or this game will never be fully enjoyable ........................................... Competitive is fun with the right players and if all players are using mics and if all are players are doing good response between players on reporting enemy locations then the games are quite enjoyable still so many players don't use mics and or are just de-ranking on purpose and or just fragging and or trolling thus De-Ranking is INEVITABLE!!!!

Airikan;-;Uh Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed Now to make it 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

Delta |;-;Amazing FPS, unlike other FPS games like COD, this is a tatical shooter game. Need stragey and best to have a mic or communications.
Unwanted;-;This game may be super frustrating and all, you know, with all the smurfs and throwers. However, after playing this game for over a year now I have come to realize that I still love and enjoy playing this piece of poop. Despite how butthurt I get and how much my scrubby teammates try to Zeus and TK a bunch, I still always come back to play this whenever I can. Obviously, skins make you MLG pro so hopefully soon enough the hundreds on dollars I've spent in CS:GO will soon pay off and bless me with Gaben's luxurious FaZe powers. To sum up this long as furk review, this game may be the reason I lose my mind 24/7, however the enjoyment of getting better and playing it with my (notso) awesome friends makes it all worthwhile! ~(o w o)~ Would reccomend to those who want to actually be cool and not play COD on console.

dJ;-;CSGO is a fantasy game about a young Scottish man in the Middle-East. Your goal is to clear the land of Russians and anyone else who is foreign. You have a large arsenal of guns also known as the AK-47, M4A1/4 and the AWP, all other guns require a large ammount of RGN, which is very Silver. The AK47 is a terrorist weapon used by the Russians, usually missing all shots and screaming "ING NOOB YOU LET MY DIE ". The way you respond to this is by holding TAB, right clicking their name and pressing "Block Communication". The AWP is a large bolt-action rifle used to take out enemies from a far. The M4A1/4 are used by the Counter-Terrorist team and are incredibly accurate. All in all a fun game but if there were less Russians it would be 10/10. -My review 6/9 not enough water.

Public Enemy;-;Counter-Strike is like an abusive husband...it s you up and ruins your life...but you keep coming back.
loori;-;Read the original version here [textuploader.com] . What I said in the previous version of this review was a bit too harsh. Like I've said before, this game is amazing. However, what breaks the game for many people is Valve's silly anti-cheating measures and decisions in addition to their laziness in fixing even the simplest of things. Besides that, we've had no real gameplay update in a very long time - apart from new operations, which aren't even made by Valve. Again, in its core, CS:GO is a masterpiece of a game, without a doubt. It plays great and it has incredible amounts of depth while only making use of simplistic mechanics. It has the potential to be the biggest eSports title, surpassing the MOBA genre even, with its catering towards both casual and competetive players. What the game is suffering from right now, however, is catering too much towards casual players and not paying attention to competetive players's wishes and to the competetive community altogether. VAC hasn't still been improved and despite many complaints, it still has questionable features such as banning people in waves. More about that and the rest of the anti-cheating measures in a minute. Besides that, CS:GO is plagued with small, easy-to-fix issues. A few, brief examples: - Weapon balancing - Character/object models being smaller than their hitboxes or vice versa (see Mirage A triplestack or Dust CT character models.) - Hitboxes in general (jumping, ladder and plant hitboxes are waaaaay off, see this and this ) - Competetive matchmaking servers being 64 tick instead of 128 - Hit detection ..and many more. As you can see by the upload dates on the videos, these issues have been apparent for almost a year, if not more. This shouldn't be happening to a very popular game made by a very successful company. After plentiful complaints made by the community, Valve has not yet commented on the issues. This highlights another issue - Valve's inability to listen and communicate. There is no excuse to this, as this hasn't always been an issue. They listened back when CS:GO was just a shadow of what it is today because the game wasn't selling. That is no longer the case. I think the reason for Valve's laziness is the fact that there's nothing that can compete with Global Offensive right now. Most of the PC FPS players are drawn over to CS:GO simply because there are not many other games they can play right now. Dota 2 gets clearly a lot more attention because it has 3 major competetitors as of right now. I can't say for sure, but it makes a lot of sense. Moving on. I have a friend that is a private cheats developer and has a lot of experience in making them - he doesn't make them because he thinks it's not morally wrong or whatever, but literally just to make money, as these things cost a lot of money - selling private, personal cheats pay about 500-800 dollars. I don't fully agree with his decisions. However, I'd like to say that neither of us condone cheating in any way. He has helped me in writing of this by giving me a more in-depth look at how they work. Most of the following are based on his answers. In a game with a competetive aspect or a competetive environment such as the official matchmaking servers, cheating cannot by any means be an issue and should be kept very minimal. Yes, no game is hack- or cheatproof. It is not possible to make such a system that keeps all the cheaters in check. But for a game of this size, cheating shouldn't be as big of a problem as it is now. VAC is terrible - and Valve is aware of it and they showcase it by creating in-game anti-cheat solutions that potentially break the game for legitimate players. Here's an example. One of these anti-cheat "solutions", as seen in the above video, works by having the server create a trace between a player and other players' heads. If for whatever reason this trace is not finished or gets abrupted, the enemy is not rendered on your computer. It's especially bad if the other player's ping is high, as the information received from the server takes longer to reach the client. This fix is only mildly effective, but it should help prevent wallhacking. However, it also affects legitimate players, like the video showcased. redacted: it doesn't break wallhacks completely redacted: for example if i'm on cat redacted: i could still see a guy on goose redacted: but i couldn't see a guy from CT spawn to T spawn (anymore) Another one of these " solutions [images.akamai.steamusercontent.com] " is unsynchronized weapon spread between the client and the server. In the picture above, red is what your client sees and blue is what the server sees. Ever shoot a whole magazine at someone and see all the bullets hitting directly behind them but only get a few hits? That happens because of this. This was implemented to prevent ragehackers, when in reality, it doesn't prevent ragehackers ability to continue ragehacking in anyway. These aren't the only ones, there are a dozen more and they only barely hurt the cheaters while hurting the legitimate players just as much. These aren't solutions, these are lazy changes which are called fixes when in reality they don't make the situation any better. If VAC were any better and could actually detect cheats with a bit more finesse, these counter-measures wouldn't be needed at all. If ESEA, a third party matchmaking service, can have a fairly decent anti-cheat, so can Valve. Now that we've established how poor VAC is, let's talk about the problems caused by cheating itself. In my opinion, the worst part about having a game with so many cheaters running rampant and so many cheats available, is having to contemplate if someone is cheating or not. It's absolutely disgusting to be forced to sit in a game for atleast 30 minutes and watch your team get slaughtered every round because of a blatant cheater, but it's even more terrible to play a game where you're not sure if the other team had some kind of external help. It's discouraging. It's not fun to wait for the game to end and get frustrated so that you don't want to play anymore, because, as I've said before, you're essentially playing a gamble when you queue up. All you can do is hope that you don't get cheaters in your game. Leaving is not an option, unless you want to get a temporary matchmaking ban. Having a surrender option available at all times would make this a lot better. Cheating is ruining competetive matchmaking, and Valve hasn't taken many steps to remedy that problem. If you wish to play competetively, your best bet would be third party matchmaking services, unfortunately. However, as bad as all of this may sound, most of these issues can be ignored especially if you're not huge into playing competetively. The game is still balanced around the fact that both players have the ability to do what the other team is doing because of the side-switching system at half-time - honestly, the only issues besides cheating that you'll be in contact with are hitbox and hit registering errors. The game is still a lot of fun, especially if you have friends you can play with. I don't regret any of the 1000 hours I've played this game with my friends, because they have all been memorable and very entertaining. To say that the game is flawless or the best FPS ever made would be silly, however. All in all, buy it. Regardless of the issues with the game. I would. It's cheap, and there is nothing else like it, so you don't have much choice anyway. Just be aware of the fact that there's 0% chance that Valve is going to fix any of the issues with the game until there's something to compete with their game.
(Radon) Napalm Candy;-;Honestly, this game just isn't my idea of fun. The wonky aiming system, amount of hours you need to put in to even become a decent enough player to think of playing comp, and the VERY toxic community make this game a chore. The only thing I enjoy doing is watching friends play, or [watching] good competitive matches between the pros.

Winter monkey;-;Since this game is amazing in every aspect you came to the wrong place for a review. But if you came for a amazing choclate chip cookie recipe you came to the right place. Ingredients 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 3/4 cup sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon fine salt Directions 1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.) 2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. 3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks. 4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve. 5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days. For a Rocky Road Bar: 1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.
Xaftos;-;This game is hands down the best FPS I have ever played, and still playing. The game can be run at max settings to look visually stunning on a beefy computer, or on a potato of a computer at lowest settings. You continually discover more and more things about the game and that's what entices me to play it more. It has a wonderful community if you put aside the hackers and griefers, and I'd say 90% of my friends list (of currently 260+ people) is from this game. I love it and the Counter-Strike series and will continue to love it throughout many years I hope. Get this game, and get it now.

Dope;-;It's a good game after all. All the Russians should have their own servers though. It's really hard to communicate when 4 players of our team speaks english and then there is that one Russian guy who just speaks russia all the way and nobody understands. And you have way too much hatred inside of you Russians too.. Valve also should put a little bit more effort into VAC. Cheaters really ruin the game, especially in competitive where they just keep on popping up when they should be gone. (And no, i do not keep every player that plays better than me a hacker) It's fun, public servers have a lot to offer. Comp for some serious gaming, or faceit/esea.
Crie;-;What cruel world do we live in where knives and hats are more expensive than guns
Legion;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life...
Jenna Coleman;-;For my English 101 class i had to write a review of something so i ended up reviewing this game and here is my review hope you enjoy. A series of Counter Strike games have been released in the past and with COunter Strike Global Offensive it has changed first person shooters. With the Creativity of the steam community they continue to change and make the game a new experience each time. Averaging 3.5 million unique players each month new ideas are displayed about every hour each day. This game is meant for people who both like FPS and are completely new to them. Players who are new or kist playing it for fun, the casual section of gameplay allows these players to experience the game on a non-competitive level. The casual section breaks down into four sub sections being deathmatch, arms race, demolition, and casual classic. Deathmatch is the perfect place to play a quick warm up game and allows players to practice using guns that they havent used before. Arms race is just like gun game from other fps games but sets the guns to 27 and it is a quick paced game and really fun if you play with a lot of friends. Demo gives the feeling of casual classic but it only has one bomb site and it is hard to plant before the counter-terrorist are dead or the terrorist are dead plus it has generally small maps. For me this is not the gamemode for me but if you want to play a quick 20-25 minute game without people yelling at you then this a good choice to play. Casual is in my opinion the game type that is most like competitive but again without the ranting and arguing of players when you lose. The couple of things that are annoying is unlike comp it only goes to 15 rounds and you dont switch sides. This does create a somewhat of an unfair game since some maps are sided towards either CT or T. With that being said I think casual is very relaxed and calming without people yelling in the microphone. Now here is where there is a lot of frustration, and annoyance but will always be fun to play. Even though I personally dont think this is the best in the game i do think it is second and a close best feature of the game. There are a lot of takeaways from comp but like any competitive game there are negatives. The competitive game type nevers gets old with different operations coming out every three-four months. Communication is key in this game and with ingame voice there are a lot of negatives but ill get to that. On most days youll get into a game with respectable nice people that dont really get mad and yell. Comp gives every player the rush to want to be the best rank, or the best player in the current lobby. Like all games you can leave midway but in this game it punishes the players to a 15-7day ban from comp. These bans are completely random so it does force people to stay in the game. With Comp it is a 30-90 minute game where it lasts 30 rounds and does switch roles to balance the game. Unlike most FPS CSGO doesnt allow players to aim down sights unless it has a scope and this is where i believe luck and skill comes in and it enhances the gameplay. Players will normally understand if you dont know the callouts on the map and will tend to help some try hard players are not so forgiving. Another great part that i can think of is valve put in chickens that roam around the maps and during the holidays they will add stuff to the chickens. Ex. last week they put in cheers and balloons so each time you killed them those would come out. The chickens can also be used to figure out where the enemies are if one happens to see it killed. The way that the game balances the skill of players is the best, they will put same skill ranks together and dont really allow high ranks to play with the low ranks. With all of the positive ideas there are sadly always negatives. CSGO community consists of people who do try a little too hard and care too much about the game. I have been in games where teammates will constantly yell into the mic just talking trash to each other and it really doesnt help them to do better. Personally i dislike like the little kids that come into the game swearing and commanding the adults on what to do and i know most of my friends feel the same way, they are called Squeakers. At times players that arent good enough to play the game will try to cheat and try to get an advantage over the other players. They will use hacks, such as a wallhack or an aimbot. There are other programs but i am not familiar with them. Also players who have been playing for a while and reached a high rank cant compete with their current rank players so they make a new account and face new people, these are called Smurfs. I know that i am missing a lot of things that people find negative about this game but these are my big negatives. Where all of the creativity in this game comes from is from the workshop and it is so vital to this game. I find this the best feature due to all of the stuff that you can make and it can be used in the game. The developers allowed players to make their own custom skins for the guns in the game and if it gets voted up by the community then it can be added the to the game and you can make money off of it. Right now there are skins that cost 450$ but there are a lot of cheap ones the expensive guns are the knives. Not only can you make skins you can make stickers that can go through the same process to get into the game. People can also make their own maps but i have yet to try that feature but i have seen some nice maps. Valve added crate drops into the game to that contains chances at getting a rare skin for the gun or knife but it can cost 1$ or so for the case and 2.50$ for the keys. I find this gambling system not worth the money so I recommend selling the cases because they do add up each week. I ended up with 25$ from drops and bought copies of the game for two of my friends. With having only 240 hours invested in the game i have seen people with over 2,000 hours so that means that it must be an amazing game for someone to have that much time put into this game.
Mr.SenpaiChan;-;This game will teach you how to live !!! Best game ever !!! :D

English Muffin;-;With this game i successfully learned fluent russian in 2 days!
Jammylicious;-;Ok, first of all I'm British and I play on Counter Strike literally every single day, playing Competitive for stupid amount of hours.. which I love doing, CS:GO Is the top/best favourite FPS game that has ever been released since the early years of 1.6, but the sad moment which lets the whole game down is MatchMaking with Russians/Polish etc.. IM british, I dont want to be in a game full of Russians that speak Russian, I want to be in a game that speak clear English. CS really needs a filter so you can search for games that are local.. not in Russia/Poland... 99.9% of Russia play CS:GO, so us UK people won't stand a chance! So redicilous! All I'm saying is that CS needs to introduce a matchmaking filter so British players can que and matchmake with other british players so we don't have to struggle playing with Russians who dont speak English! Competitive is a game about communication, teamwork... not listening to other players speak in a different language leaving you out of the team!... CS:GO needs Matchmaking Filters!...
Bloo;-;It's a great game but if you have played games like call of duty and battlefield, you will have some difficulty converting into cs:go. I have alot of hours but am still only silver 3. That's because of the 2 months I took to learn the maps and recoil patterns of each, and almost every gun. The Ak-47 is an amazing rifle on the Terrorist side but is VERY hard to learn the recoil pattern, then there are guns like the M4A1-S that are much easier to use but do slightly less damage. Pistols are important to learn. If you can win the first 2 rounds of a competitive match your team is much more likely to win the half. This is a great game definitley worth the low price of 15$ sometimes even 7.49 so Definitley pick this game up and if you would like you can add me if you would like to play or ask for more tips!
Greeny;-;Counter strike is a very competitive game and through time will without doubt make you engrossed into its series!

OnlyMes;-;This game is filled with hackers ... how do i know? cuz im one of those hackers (hack tools are surprisingly easy to obtain) ... here's the story . Me and 3 of my buddies Got  because of 2 consecutive games with a blatant hacker ... so we decided to do the same thing.. we browsed google and finally found a working hack on (OldSchoolHack csgo) <--- there we used the hack(wall/aimbot/bunnyhop) for like a month then finally i got banned ... soon as i got banned my friends stopped using the hack and got away safely without any VAC .... this proves that VALVE IS ING  ..... after i complain pretending that im not a hacker valve said that it was a legit ban and if i still want to play csgo i must "PURCHASE THE GAME ON A NEW ACCOUNT" ....... really? so from this i can see that VALVE doesnt really want to fix the hack problem .. What they want is that THEY WANT PEOPLE TO CHEAT SO THEY CAN BAN THEM AND MAKE THEM BUY ANOTHER CSGO ... its all about business really ... but still this proves that VALVE doesnt give a  about the community...
TacticalTacoCrosser;-;People get angry at me for taking my time to not get killed when last alive. Abuse simulator with guns nein/nein would play again

Zero_L0gic The Kamikaza;-;Still not sure why they didnt name this game Russian Sniper Strike
SausauRJ `;-;Currently the best competitive FPS indeed ! It is difficult to take in hand the game at the beginning, but with some practice, you should get the mechanics of the game. The strong point is that VALVe publishes updates regularly but also brings a support for the eSport with "eSport cases", team sticker or event cashprize (ESL One, DreamHack). VALVe is also close to the community and also helps map maker with the Operation/Season Pass like Operation Breakout or Operation Phoenix, so you can play community map in competitive mode ! The weak point imo, is the community, you're a noob, ou you're a cheater. Furthermore, there are many cheater when the game is cheap on Steam, but these low prices are usually followed by many VAC ban... This game does not look like other games as the Call of Duty Saga (this game is for child and noob) and they want to make money, CS:GO is a real competitive game which knows how to evolve and which knows how to listen to his community pro and casual community ! GL & HF ! Thanks VOLVO :D
NotSoElite;-;10/10 would play again apart from the god dam DAK DAKs
best player euw;-;Playing this game is like masturbating with sandpaper.
SuperKango;-;I bought this game and learned fluent russian soon after for the low price of ONLY 13.99$! 10/10 would definately recommend!
truveh;-;A great sequel of the one and only shooter game for people that like tactical play and hardcore aiming. Maps are good and the recoil system requires some good practice. Even though I think it would have been better to create a game more similar to the game Counter-Strike: Source, but that is just my personal opinion. The only problem in this game is the amount of cheaters and the fact that the game price gets changed to 3,49 sometimes which means that there will be a huge hacker wave again. Valve should do something about it or create an anti-cheat that you can CHOOSE to enable for matches on protected servers.
//-The Seige-\\ Xraelum;-;Great game, really fun to play, 9/10.
Sappertron;-;CSGO relies heavily on teamwork. Whilst this game's mechanics are extremely well done and fun to learn, the idea of forcing players to work as a team is it's major downfall. Unless you have 4 other friends to play with, more often than not you're going to be matched with trolls, griefers and/or bad players, which becomes extremely frustrating. Other than that, goes on sale all of the time and is a lot of fun. If you have the friends or think you can meet some whilst playing then I really can't reccomend it enough. Nothing beats the tension of this game
Roscoe's Wetsuit;-;This game is a 10/10 on the cheek scale.
Plusnet Band;-;If you're looking for BS; this game is full of it. 100% full of shi*. More shi* than in India, there is literally shi* everywhere especially if you've eaten their curry. Your  will become the colour of jalfrezi curry. Anyways, the CS GO review. It can be classed as "addictive" as you just want to rank up and go pro and make some money. The ranking system is fuc*ing full of shi*, doesn't even have one. Took 5 wins in a row to go up a rank and 2 matches to lose the fuc*ing rank. Now I get teamed with the SHI*TEST players in the world, a bunch of dribble cakes. Just go BLAH BLAH BLAH and dribble comes out of their mouth while talking. Some people just can't play the game, they use the AWP and they couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat. Most games I am top of the leaderboard which you would have thought you go up a rank by being top of the games right? NO, wins is all you need. Doesn't matter if you're the worst player in the world and get carried by your team. You will go up a rank where as good players who are teamed with  players are penalised and go down ranks. So yes, the ranking system in this game is non-existent, matchmaking is worse than COD. In conclusion, this game is not worth the money. I would rather be a giraffe and play contagion. GG Valve
z0ks_;-;When i bought this game in early 2013 i didnt think it would become into oneof the most biggest eSport games of 2014/2015. At first i wasnt that keen on the game, everything was unbalanced and it was so weird and bad compered to 1.6 and Source, then when Valve decided to put some efort into polishing this game it turned out to be one (if not the best) game that they made. Everyone on Steam needs to have this masterpiece of a game. 10/10
Kaito-kun;-;11/10 Can make chicken became zombie (sv_holiday mode 1)
PEPE FROG;-;Whats not to like about this game it offers the best compettive multiplayer and requries teamwork to win. ThIs game is a must buy for any shooter fan and gamer who wants to not deal with the bs of no skill gap and that wants to excel in a fps game. 10/10
Jorvan;-;Thiis Is The WORS ADDICTION EVER!
Dr. non-ejac. O;-;Game : Good Community:  The only problem of this game is its community, which consists mainly of immature little kids that have not enjoyed any form of education. Remember those scum kids in Kindergarden whose parents would allow them to do anything? This game collects all of them into one huge set of idiots with no restraints, no respect, no manners, no common sense, and absolutely no intelligence. The best way to play this game: Get a team of friends and mute everybody else. Otherwise you are going to lose a lot of your brain cells and also all hope in humanity. Only in 0.00000001% of the cases you actually get to play with nice people who play for fun, who don't rage at you for their own faults, who can teamplay and communicate, and most importantly, whose self-confidence and ego do not depend on "being pro in csgo". My final thought on this game: rip humanity.
[DM]Wanard;-;bomb throwing simulator! :D auto sniper rifle simulator and one shot->headshot with ak47 over map ;D
-- Fat CHICKEN;-;10/10 Must Buy this Game >_<
El Taco B. Beltwhippo;-;This is my favourite game in the Cooking Mama series. Unlike the previous games, this one goes through various platforms. Strangely the PC version is the only version that's updated, I mean the SNES is a pretty big competitor to the PC. THE GAME ITSELF: "Counter-Strike: Terrorism X" is an addictive RPG game where the player must complete puzzles with his/her teammates, I personally think "Counter-Strike: A Letter to his Son About His Father" done it better, most of the community seems to agree. This creates a very competitive situation, but luckily the community knows it's all a game and is made for fun. The weapons I usually use are Energy Sword and Rail Gun. THE COMMUNITY: On the topic of community, it is by far the nicest I've ever played with, they know people make mistakes and don't have the ability to fight 5 over players by themselves. There is a kick button that's never used for the player's personal use so they may not face the penalities of deranking, as that's ridicolous and it's only a game. THE GRAPHICS: Made with Frostbite, the graphics are stunning. THE VERDICT: 4.5/5 Shrek: Forever After is good at what it does. My actual review? This game is full of people with their heads screwed so far up their asses. The community is toxic enough to make the planet extinct. It's good.
GreenSoap;-;Maybe if it's on sale...
Goopy;-;Its OK.
5baz away 1 week;-;Still better than Call of Duty...
........;-;CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.
sweetopia.turon;-;best cs game on the franchise
Blue_Dee;-;Quite simply, this feels like a reskin of CS:S. Sure some backend stuff may have changed but to me as a player, it feels the same. This leaves the game in an awkward sort of limbo between old and new with fancy graphics that, if anything, make the outdated gameplay stand out more than ever. If you really love CS, but for some reason cannot play CS:S without improved graphics, get this. If you are new to the series, don't buy it or you will just end up feeling lost, hurt and confused :/

L3XIEEE;-;Best Competitive game ever.
Ainsley;-;I think it is a terrible game. It stole all of it's gamemodes from Call of Duty. CS:GO competitive is just extended search and destroy and Valve didn't even bother to rename Demolition, they must be pretty lazy. The aim sucks because the bullets don't go straight to the center but spray all over. Even with that small difference it is still blatant copy of Call of Dewty. What kind of a game steals everything from Call of Duty and doesn't implement some of the best features, like the Intervention sniper rifle. As a Silver 1 I would just like to show everyone how I quickscope in Call of Dewty. I mean, what engine is this game on? Is it that dated engine quake ran on; Just look at how good fall of duty looks each year since they revamp the engine from scratch every year. Basically, you want to play Call of Booty. CS:GO is for people who are casuals, COD is for hardcore gamres and takes sooooo much more skill. If you don't belieev me message me on steam and we can 1v1 on MW2 Rust, Quickscopes only.
Toast @Memeo2015;-;Once a guy on my team shot me and then I shot him in the head and got banned for a week. 10/10
kennymB;-;simplicity at its finest
Spiegel;-;Great game for the casual or the competetive FPS player. Coming from games like OC, Quake, and Uberstrike, this game really forces you to improve your reflex time as well as your accuracy. I wasn't much for the modern games until I tried this one out, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great FPS. Here's a little "Pro/Con". Pros: Extremely fun and addicting gameplay Balenced gameplay Good graphics with exellent map designs Engaging gameplay Great community and team aspect Skill cap is extremely high Playable on even low grade computers (mine's 1.5 Ghz) Cons: Costs real money, if you're a usual F2P gamer then this might detract you from it Learning curve is extremely steep, you'll need to invest time into this game (not really a con but for some people they just want a "fun" game to run around on. If that's the case, this game is not for you No major FOV changes, (I realize there are a few things you can do to change it, but for a Quake player like myself, it was rough to get used to after playing with 115 FOV for a while) Requires a mic (To be completely honest, if you want to get good at this game and engage in teamplay, you WILL need a mic , otherwise you'll be hardpressed to type out strats and the status' of your enemies) Hackers. Just like most games out there you will run into these . They are easy to report but be warned, they do exist. If you get my gist, the cons are really just minor things. Nothing really is so annoying that I would consider stopping playing this game. 9/10 Spiegel
Frost;-;New Grahpic, New Maps, New Animations and Guns, best counter strike version after CS S
Moa hatedminionsbeforeitwascool;-;pretty fun rootie tootie shoot something something british
Bradley;-;Just moved over to PC gaming from console and after spending so much time on CoD over on Xbox, CS:GO is a fresh of breath air. This game is amazing and for such a small price you would be stupid not to buy it!
KittymanAdvance;-;Love this game. Spent way too much time playing it.
Shame_Veritas;-;Cool FPS very good game :) BUY IT
Unknown;-;awesome game would recomend it anyday
KRiMZ;-;CS:GO is the best competitive FPS game I have ever played. I believe it's difficult enough to be a challenging game for gamers. Plus, It's a really nice and enjoyable game. It has improved graphics from the other CS games and you can find it for only 10,99! There are two bad things about this game, one is that the competitive matchmaking can sometimes ruin your game (join you with noobs), the second one is that a lot of people get addicted with the weapon skins (Valve items) and can spend a lot of money in cases and keys. To sum up, I recommend this game to everyone who's looking for a good FPS to play. My Rating is: 9.5/10.
Kuudere Simulator;-;0/10 this game is worst play stronkhold kindoms insted
Vi0LeNcE_;-;This Game = Profit. DISCLAIMER: Profit will only occur if you invest initial money for Operation Coins to get the Case Drops. If you want to risk it you can open cases and try your luck in getting a knife!
.:: XycLoNe ::.;-;Best First-person shooter Game ever on Steam! Highly recommmended. Just go for It! You will find this game interesting, very interesting actually. Good support, no crashes, good FPS and what else do you want ? The team support!!!
YF-NightMare;-;This game is all around good game addicting too if you're into FPS shooters you'd love this one its a little difficult for starters and gets frusturating but eventually you'll understand how it works and how to be accurate once you get that down its a 10/10 game graphics aren't the best but you get used to it, its gameplay that counts. You should really get this it's a must buy game
I'm Ghosty ^-^`;-;Only have 50Hours+ But so far this is the best FPS out there. It beats CoD and Battlefield just the community on there brings rewards from its self. I would really recommend this to my friends and to everyone if they are into FPS. Plus I've been a Counterstike kid since 2005 now its 2014 and the love is still here for the CS community. Keep the game the way its suppost to be :) : >5Stars< EDIT: Its been over 400 hours now and still satified
1NT3L . AllahuAkbar;-;great game but it
Goopy;-;Its OK.
5baz away 1 week;-;Still better than Call of Duty...
........;-;CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.
Braxis;-;pew pew pew best pew game ever!!
SALUT;-;This destroyed my life. My gf left me. I lost my job. But I still got the dink. 10/10
TheBest;-;Ruined my life. 10/10
Lennie;-;Counter-Strike: GO doesn't fail to please me. It's a great competitive game with new guns, new modes, better graphics, and a gy community, That's pretty much the only downside... But CS:GO is a very well made competitive game. But if you are me, you would prefer CSS over this game. But both are spectacular games. Thank you once again, Valve :)
That One Guy;-;still the best game
Goldy;-;One of the best FPS I've ever played...
Master Merc;-;This game ruined my ing life. 10/10 would play again.
Stackz;-;This is the only FPS game since 1.6 i enjoy.

TroJaN994;-;i love this game
ThatBlackB0y;-;First the Good review: - It's CS 10/10 - The weapons sistem is nothing like the others cs, you can gain the skin weapons by playing or opening boxes or buying them on the market, and that's very cool. Now the bad review, and this one makes me so angry: - The competitive: 1 - The team, if can find those noob teams that kill their own partners or just be AFK the whole game! 2 - The Competitve Cooldown, now this one it's just annoying and overwhelming stupid, because you get kicked by leaving the game and that's fine but imagine that your net goes down or our PC was turn off because of some lightning, you will get that same kick and you can't to nothing about it and that's makes me so angry because you get 7 days of penalty because you net was down and that's not fair. Hope that this will help someone!
Sifi(^);-;Love this game, besides from all the campers, this is really fun, join a casual competetive, and you just start rampaging, this game has amazing graphics, beautiful soundtrack, and amazing weapon sounds, although some things are worse then in cs:s (wich was the ground for competetive fps gamers) it still is amazing. Play with friends, go online, do what you want! Steam market, yus, made me happy. Buy whatever you want, getawesome cool skins for your guns, and be famous. 9/10, some bugs remain, some netcode bugs aswell (run around corner, but still die D:) But, still amazing!
Crystal;-;Inexpensive game with effective anti-hack system, supported with good matchmaking system. Waste no time in finding a multiplayer game. Never an easy game to master and best played tactically with friends. Individual skills and team communications are essentials.
nEw1;-;the only thing that i can say about this game is *fantastic*... xD
Oatz;-;Counter-Strike started off well. Counter-Strike:GO is different from CS:S and CS:CZ, etc. CS:GO has different guns, different maps, different spray patterns, different everything. Throw away everything you knew from CS:S because this game is different. Where the P90 was a standard SMG in CS:S, in this game, it's used as a smaller LMG. I still do love this game!
EcliPse;-;very shooting much headshots wow cheaters
Miraku;-;Takes a while to get used to, but after a while, you'll like it. AWP op but meh 10/10 would bang
Arbibus (Joker);-;This game is THE FPS of the time. Better than Call of Duty. Better than Battlefield 3. Better than Arma III.  the others, Counter-Strike is in the place. What a funny, strategic and amazing game !!
Nulty!;-;This game is definitely an improvement on the previous games. Now its super easy to find a competitive match. I found it very hard on css and cs 1.6. Also you dont even have to be in a group of 5 to find one.Another thing which was annoying about the previous ones if that people can lie about their skill group which left the match unbalanced. CSGO has a ranking system which will put you against people with a similar rank, and its a good thing to strive towards reaching that next rank. Put that together with the custom gun skins they have brought into it, it turns into a fun and very replayable game. 9/10
Hikkler;-;This game has an amazing topology system versus Counter Strike Source, and the fact that it uses a system for item drops, sellable in the market is amazing. This is one FPS that will most likely not be abandoned for along time. A story I tell everyone is a took a break from gmod, so I went to CS:GO, and went back to garry's mod, and i could headshot a pedo bear.
Chief;-;I have played ALOT of Counter Strike 1.6 and the game was just AWESOME , but after playing this I have to say that this beats most of the multiplayer shooters out there. The graphics are greatly improved , there are various play modes , new weapon designs , new voice acting. etc . Must buy if you love shooters.
sweetopia.turon;-;best cs game on the franchise
Blue_Dee;-;Quite simply, this feels like a reskin of CS:S. Sure some backend stuff may have changed but to me as a player, it feels the same. This leaves the game in an awkward sort of limbo between old and new with fancy graphics that, if anything, make the outdated gameplay stand out more than ever. If you really love CS, but for some reason cannot play CS:S without improved graphics, get this. If you are new to the series, don't buy it or you will just end up feeling lost, hurt and confused :/
pAzz * crimson.gg;-;Amazing game. If you like competitive shooters,definetly worth your money,especially now on sale.
wiSe PaNdA;-;Css was my favourite been playing since the first counter strike. this game is awesome i use to play the beta and put in like 300+ hours. then i stopped playing for a while because all my stats got reset. this game is deffinatly worth getting even for $15. most valve games are great!. 8/10 great graphics , way better than css and the sounds are improved heaps.
Railer;-;Probably the hardest FPS game i ever played Very fun, addicting etc and it actually takes skill to play +1 :)
qwerty123;-;gorgeous sporty game, even when I'm ing my girlfriend, in minds "don't drain middle, uckers"
() C9 TAKE MY BUTTHOLE;-;I can review CS:GO when I don't even own it. Plus I heard ya can make money of it. 11/10 best game ever.
Johnny Cash;-;This game is . Greedy V*lve deceived many players and became rich. But I play this game for steam wallet only. I don't recommend to play for painted pieces of iron. Just have fun in this game! :)
cjsrift Get High;-;Worst ing gmae you will ever play.....its only bad because when steam takes a , which we all know happends ( that random DC from servers crap) it will ban you from compet game mode for hours some times weeks and nor STEAM or CS-GO support will do jack  to help you, so until they fix that or care about there so called "caring steam users" dont buy this ing game.

Goldy;-;One of the best FPS I've ever played...
Add: shobhit_deshwal;-;I am pretty addicted to this game. I've been playing almost every single day, ever since 1.6. On some days I would play all day, and I would only stop when my arm muscles were too tired to move the mouse, and I would hardly be able to aim right anymore.
SoulLess;-;this is the best game i have ever played. its my favirote game its so skill based and not just a stupid grind like cod and other shooters the aiming is skill base and matches require tactics and team play to win once 1 has mastered the game he can take down a team of 5 all on himself. this game has hundreds of hours of play time that will not make you bored one bit (unless you lose all the time)
Tywyllach;-;Fire in the hole! 10/10

Achmed the S.A. Penguin;-;This ruined my social life.
CrObInStInE;-;I remember when Counter Strike didn't have idle lobbies so people can collect cases and guns just to sell them... I also remember when you wanted to play competitive mode and weren't stuck with 14 year old little boys who just like to friendly fire. Since the game went on sale for 4$ at one point. Every kid and their little brother has an account now. If you are going to play with a group of friends this is a fun way to go. If you want to be stuck with a group of random idiots. Then this is your game!
Pale Dolphin;-;The Counter-Strike franchise had it's highs (CS 1.6) and lows (CS:Source), but the newest iteration was damn worth the wait. Sufficient to say, you don't need 1.6 anymore, if you have CS:GO. Game's 9.5 out of 10.0, a must buy.
Z E U $;-;Great game to play with friends , Fixed some bugs with new updates.
Cake-Splosion;-;I for one believe the best part of this game is killing chickens. That is all there is.
Ol' Ronny;-;Its like TF2 except not like TF2 at all. Whose  do you have to suck to get some ing hats added though, I mean seriously. I love the weapon skins and all, but I don't like how the counter-terrorists wear ing bean-bags on their head. Oh, and don't get me started on the Terrorists! I for one think that their headgear is culturally insensitive, I'd love for the option to put a turban on my Terrorist.

TeeJayy STOP SIGN ELMO GET OUT;-;This game is alright I guess It taught me several important life lessons: 1) virtual knives are cool and are sure to get the opposite sex to notice you 2) virtual knives are more expensive than real life ones cos they are of higher build quality 3) if your gas cooker is about to explode and you could put it out with a fire extinguisher but you are wearing a posh suit, run and save the suit (it was bloody expensive, you know?) 4) silver is, in fact, the least valuable metal in the world 5) russians are lovely people 10/10, if you are looking to teach your child important life skills such as sharing, working together and collecting knives, this game is a must.

El Taco B. Beltwhippo;-;This is my favourite game in the Cooking Mama series. Unlike the previous games, this one goes through various platforms. Strangely the PC version is the only version that's updated, I mean the SNES is a pretty big competitor to the PC. THE GAME ITSELF: "Counter-Strike: Terrorism X" is an addictive RPG game where the player must complete puzzles with his/her teammates, I personally think "Counter-Strike: A Letter to his Son About His Father" done it better, most of the community seems to agree. This creates a very competitive situation, but luckily the community knows it's all a game and is made for fun. The weapons I usually use are Energy Sword and Rail Gun. THE COMMUNITY: On the topic of community, it is by far the nicest I've ever played with, they know people make mistakes and don't have the ability to fight 5 over players by themselves. There is a kick button that's never used for the player's personal use so they may not face the penalities of deranking, as that's ridicolous and it's only a game. THE GRAPHICS: Made with Frostbite, the graphics are stunning. THE VERDICT: 4.5/5 Shrek: Forever After is good at what it does. My actual review? This game is full of people with their heads screwed so far up their asses. The community is toxic enough to make the planet extinct. It's good.

tsu;-;ehh aint the best
Vanila;-;Dying so many times but I still love this game, it really depends on my teammates. Love to play this game :)
Yella;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a game that I really recommend to all of you because: - is cheaper than the rest from the category shooting - is a method to banish boredom - is a good method to increase your performance at aim - have a really nice graphic - have trading cards - have cool skins - have drops (you can receive items for free) - have a fair VAC staff - the skins evolve day by day - and... why you don't try? Enjoy!
Aladino;-;Dis is so guud, Shooting People and stuff!
HAHAHAHA;-;Great game :-D
wig | CSGOLucky.com;-;In the wonderful world of competitive, watch your teams get steamrolled by smurfs and just plain old hackers! Win 5 rounds in a row and then not rank up the next because the great matchmaking puts you up to those conditions! Lose connection for 5 minutes? Say goodbye to competitive as you'll automatically be issued a cooldown- which consist of 30 minutes, 2 hours, 24 hours and a whole week! The cooldowns also decrease after each week of not abandoning- great system, Valve! Get ranked up then get steamrolled by smurfs the next 3 rounds, lose connection the 4th round, and then have it count as an abandon and then get deranked! That said, what a great game! 11/10 would derank, get steamrolled, aimbotted, wallhacked and lose to high ranked players using an alternate account to play against other players in the silver tiers- considered "noobs"- as practice again!
Mitchell;-;Too much fun! You'll have hours of fun experience shooting people! This is the game that is really realistic compared to modern FPS games, the engine in this feels very much like the one used in Counter-Strike: Source and that's because it is, although it's updated it's the same engine so there isn't too much to get used to. I've played hours of this with my friends and this game runs perfectly smooth on pretty much any computer even with outdated parts, the updated classic maps are really nice and the workshop community is amazing! There's sooo many custom maps to choose from and I'd highly recommend this game over any CoD! 10/10 best FPS game I've ever owned
Kaotic;-;This game is pretty much the best FPS on PC ever it's actually balanced unlike games *cough cough CoD* The camos are pretty cool but i'm not going to pay for them hahah lol but the games graphics are really good and the game makes sense. There's a lot of modes you can play community made modes and modes made by the devs. 9/10 There is quite a bit of Hackzorz
Reviving Jake;-;One of the best games I've ever played on Steam. REAL NIGUHS WILL PLAY THIS GAME!!!! YOU GET TO KILL ALL DA WHITE BOYZ!!! YOU JUST GOTTA HAVE AIM AND A MAC -10 AND GLOCK!!

Nev The Bear;-;I played my first match of casual CS:GO and straight away realised this is alot like garrys mod, so i tried to noclip and was shot... I then play my first competitive match and wondered why everyone had gold stars and ak's so i went into paint and drew one to use as my profile picture. Then finally i was walking around office slighty more experienced at the game in genral, learning grenade tactics and peaking ect, i then came to realise that i had killed quite alot of people that round and began to be called a hacker/smurf which obviously wasnt true considering i have 1 account and at the time about 5 hours game time, so thats somthing to keep in mind, Note to self: (Eveyone, when they rage call others hackers). And finally chickens, i knifed one, got hungry, went downstairs, made chicken sandwhich, came back upstairs, 30 minute ban. 10/10 Would Knife again.

Devul;-;At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses. The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty cannot and with no health regeneration, each encounter with each enemy is a life threatening situation. The game is simply tactful; its brilliant when youre alive and even when youre dead the game is still fun to watch other players.
Dr.E.Bola;-;Very good game, thumb's up from me.
Wulvy;-;just reviewing for a badge
DreaM;-;I've played Call of Duty for around 6 years, and I have played the Counter Strike series for maybe 4 months now. CS:GO has to be the best game I've played in a long time. Although it's harder to play, it's so much more fun to play than any game I've previously played. Would highly reccomend to anyone who plays FPS's.
munki :^);-;Counter-Strike is one of those slightly forgotten industry giants. For Counter-Strike, it created the standard for modern military shooters, but was quickly changed into less strategic styles and more arcade-ish styles. For us "PC master race" people here on Steam, we have Counter-Strike as our go-to shooter. This game has a steep learning curve. That means when you play for the first time you will die. A lot. But instead of whining about your death, I suggest the smarter approach: analyze what happened, how you died, why you died, and what this means for your future gameplay. This is the kind of game that demands you to learn, otherwise you'll just be six feet under each round with a team wondering why you suck so bad. There are many helpful guides both here on Steam and on the internet in general. Just look around. Now here's the pros and cons to playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive instead of the other Counter-Strike titles. Remember that some pros and cons can have different meaning and effect for different people. Also remember this is all just my opinion. Pros: - People are playing By this I mean there are plenty of servers with plenty of people and plenty of games to be had without running into all bot games every single time. Granted, other CS titles still have running servers with people, but there's just a larger scale of players in CS:GO. - The mechanics allow for easier learning While I did start with CS: Source, I wasn't very good because I did not understand the game at all, and only got to seriously playing and trying to learn with CS:GO. CS:S, in comparison to CS:GO, is very bad at teaching the player it's core mechanics on its own. Now that's perfectly fine, it was an older iteration, and many CS players were already good anyways. What I'm saying is that if you have not played a CS game before, or are not good yet, CS:GO would be a better purchase for such a new player. - Price is cheaper Kind of speaks for itself. CS:GO costs $14.99 (USD) while CS:S /currently/ costs $19.99 (USD), which still doesn't make sense to me. The original CS is $9.99 (USD) currently I believe on Steam, but it is such an older game that unless you're collecting, it's MUCH more worth it to pay the extra $5 to get CS:GO, just because in this case, newer means higher quality. - [EDIT 3/12/15] More Customization In CS 1.6, there was some customization, but it was limited. You could choose between different preset sizes for your crosshair, and different preset colors. You could also make your viewmodel for your weapon left handed, meaning the image of your arms and gun on your screen is mirrored to the left side instead of the right. In CS:S, you could do all this, and also toggle a dot for your crosshair. However, in CS:GO, the range of customizability is greatly increased. Now you can: alter the 3D position of your viewmodel, change the gap between the dot of your crosshair and its legs, change the thickness of the crosshair, and even change the crosshair between 6 different styles with varying properties. The first 2 styles are simple default (style 0) and default static (style 1), which are both this kind of uniquely designed crosshair, with the regular default crosshair dynamically moving with your character's movement and the shooting of your gun. The last 4 styles are all the custom type crosshair, which looks more traditional but can be heavily customized with the previously mentioned settings. Style 2 is a dynamic crosshair with ghosted strips that expand outwards when you move. The crosshair also moves when you shoot. Style 3 is the same, except without the ghosted strips; It's just the dot and the legs. The legs still move. Style 4 is full static, as in nothing moves ever. I prefer this one, but thats just me. Style 5 is static, EXCEPT when you shoot it expands and then quickly returns to its original state. I like to use this one sometimes because the moving of the legs of the crosshair usually times with the bullets coming out of the gun, so for spraying it helps me have a rough idea where i'm at with my bullets in the clip. However for me the movement of it can be distracting, but again, its all preference. Another thing you can do for customization purposes is resize and rezoom the radar. You can also change the positions of the edges of your HUD, meaning you can bring it towards the center if you like. I make my hud horizontally as close to the center as i can, because it lets me see info on my HUD just a tad bit faster and without taking my eyes too far off the crosshair. Anyways, I kinda went on wayyyy too long just for customization, BUT MY POINT IS, (^^^TL;DR^^^): CS:GO's general customization has much more to it than the older iterations. It allows every player to have a very specific set of preferences for their preferred style, and I believe that makes it quite a good game, compared to many multiplayer shooters where theres little to no customization of such things. Cons: - The Players (atleast at the lower ranks) I've noticed recently that queueing for competitive when not with a fully lobby of friends can kinda suck, atleast at the lower ranks. The reason being that, atleast from what I've experienced, you'll find a lot of teammates who don't care enough to put their full effort into winning the match, which, if you understand the ranking system, absolutely ruins those of us who want to rank up and take the game seriously in a fun, competitive sense. SO, my suggestion, for those of you that love the teamwork and cooperation of competitive matches, is to acquire 4 people that take the game as seriously as you do, and play with them on a regular basis. This immediately eliminates the possibility of getting poor teammates, because you're already set up with a full 5 man team of people willing to put their full effort in to win. Honestly that's the best way to enjoy CS, in my opinion. -The Servers A huge issue, atleast to those of us who prefer a serious, competitive environment, is the quality of the Valve-hosted competitive servers. Us serious players usually enjoy the ranking system that is implemented, but it is frustrating when your failure in a round isn't due to any of your own mistakes, but rather the flaws of the server and it's registration. Registration is basically a server knowing that when you shoot at a guy, and you did everything right, the bullet hits him. It registers the hit. A problem with some Valve servers in CS:GO is that it feels kinda like you have to shoot relatively where you see them, instead of right at them. The poor registration mainly comes from the servers being in 64 tick, which means 64 ticks of information being sent to and from the server every second. With split second conflicts that could decide important rounds, it's pretty important that stuff works the way it's suppose to. And when it doesn't, it sucks. 128 tick servers, hosted by the community or by leagues like faceit, CEVO, or ESEA, usually fix this issue. Everything feels a bit tighter and more responsive on 128 tick, and you actually feel like you have to shoot right at the guy's head to 1 tap him, instead of vaguely towards his head area. It's a huge debate on how to fix this issue though, and that argument can be saved for the internet where someone's video probably talks about it. -The Sound Now, I don't mean the sounds themselves; They're fine. I mean the directions of them. In CS, it's VERY important that it is clear to your ears where sounds are coming from, because it relays some of the most important information about the enemy to you. But a problem with CS:GO's sound is that sometimes, right sounds like left, or behind sounds like infront, or any other combination of non-accurate direction. It needs to be fixed, for competition's sake. Anyways, to briefly close, I believe CS:GO is the best option for newer CS players. Just remember that if your teammates are taking it serious, you should to. GLHF!!
[fireflame988];-;I was only 13 years old. I loved CS:GO so much. I had all the sticker offers. I pray to Gaben every night, hoping I would unbox a stattrak some day. "Gaben is love," I said. "Gaben is life." My dad overhears me and calls me a hacker. I know he's just jealous that I got recruited into FaZe clan. I call him a hardscoper. My dad no scopes me and sends me to my room. As I feel my numb face, I turn on my PC and log into Steam. My hands are shivering as I click on the "PLAY" button to open up CS:GO "I'll show that hardscoper," I said. I open up the Steam Market Place, and purchase 20 Half Life 3 Cases and Keys. 10 minutes have passed by, and I've unboxed 19 sticker capsules. As I move my cursor over to the final case, I click and select "OPEN". My cursor moves even slower as I move it towards the giant, green "USE KEY" button. I click the button. As I see all of these weapons fly by, the scroll finally starts slowing down. "I can't look," I said to myself. "My dad will noscope me when he see's that I've spent six grand on super exclusive and rare Half Life 3 Cases and Keys. I close my eyes and listen as I hear Gaben laughing over me, as if I am almost certain that I did not get a knife. I open my eyes. A large clump of feces leaves my  very quick, as my eyes look at the item I have just been given by the Holy Gaben himself. Another clump starts sliding out as I stand up to run to my dad to tell him that I've just unboxed a StatTrak Negev | Desert-Strike (Field-Tested) My dad cries as he suddenly gets his Steam account hacked by OpTic. I pull out my new gun and quickscopes his face. I then walk into my room, take my pants off, and thrust my pelvic region into the air, imagining Gaben with me. "Gaben is love, Gaben is life."

JEY - new acc - /id/JEYRAZZ;-;Maybe the only FPS where it truly goes down to a game of pure skill and teamwork. Counter-Strike is the most competetiv game in my opinion and CS:GO Is a great sequel to the 1.6 and Source, including matchmaking, watching other peopl's matches and the limitless options of becoming a better player. If you are into competetiv games that require individual skill and teamwork, you should get Counter-Strike Global offensive hands down!

Romse;-;Why Counter Strike Global Offensive is Garbage. It is not playable and haven't been for 2-3 months now. The things you can do now : Play MM (Aka Ranked matches) Buy items Sell items Inspect items Play with yourself The things you could do before: Play MM (Aka Ranked matches) Buy items Sell items Inspect items Play with yourself Play Casual games like Arms Race, DeathMatch, DefuseMissions, Hostage Missions. Play 3 different maps packs in Casual You could play on Different server accross custom servers. .... and the list go on and on. Atm how it stands it is a waste of 14 Euros / 15 Dollars / 12 Pounds . You would get more if you were to buy a big Family dinner than this Garbage. You could also donate this kind of money to Charity instead, you would feel better than buying this that's for sure. If Valve Doesn't do something about this soon / a long time ago i would rate them as worse than EA or Very Close for me at least.
Ma nezajebaji brate;-;This game would be freaking great... If it was not for sorry for bad words: ing   who are simply griefing, insulting you, not cooperating or even better in the start of the match they do not even bother speaking english with you easily they just rundown whole their vocabulary of insults in their mother language instead of telling you info... 10/10 game 0/10 people playing it...

Mr. Sloth | CSGObetting.guru;-;The Good: -Great gameplay, keeps drawing me back to get better. New players might think the game is broken when they miss all their shots, but really this game is polished, and most of the time whenever someone finds a new glitch Valve fixes it. Very fun to play, and addictive. -Valve updates the game constantly, and takes feedback from players of the game. They update the game around the pro scene too, for instance at the $250,000 Dreamhack Winter 2014 a very large percentage of CT rifle kills were with the M4A1-S instead of the M4A4. Valve changed the price of the M4A1-S to be $200 more, just like the M4A4. They constantly balance out guns and fix glitches. -There is a great profesional scene for this game, filled with large tournaments and passionate players. Some players can even play CS:GO for a job, getting money from sponsorships, streaming, prize money and etc. It's very fun to watch teams play eachother in tournaments, and you can even bet skins on games. GoTV works fairly well, where you can hear casters and see the game go on through spectator mode. Sometimes grimy things happen in the competitive scene though, such as throwing matches for skins/money and players caught cheating. Overall the competitive scene is great! -There are paid items in this game, called weapon skins. They show different patterns and colors on your gun, and don't give you or other players any advantages when they have them. They are generally just fun to look at. Many weapon skins are made by the community, in CS:GO workshop. The people who make the skins that are added into the game are actually paid real money when someone buys their skin! Few other companies or games do this, and it's really great for the people spending their tame making custom skins. People can also make maps too, which can be sometimes added into the game. The map creators get paid for their hard work if the map gets added too! -Depending on how good you are at the game, you have have a competitive rank! This means you will play with people simalar to your skill level when you play competitive. You can rank up too. This is great because you don't get matched up with some pros when you are new to the game. -You can easily play with friends in this game, which makes the competitive expirience a whole lot better. The Nuetral: -You can bet items on csgolounge, which can be good or bad. Some people get addicted and lose all their skins, but some people can actually make a profit out of it. It can ruin some people's inventories while make other people rich. The Bad: -Some people dislike this and some people don't care, but smurfing can happen. This is when a player buys CS:GO on an alt account, and plays competitively. The game will think this is the player's first game, so they match them up with some inexperienced players. This 'smurf' can destroy the other team singlehandedly, and sometimes it can ruin the experience if you are new to the game. Sometimes these 'smurfs' can mess around, not taking it seriously. They can mess with your game, not try, and ruin the experience for the team the smurf is on. -Not a great community. Most people you meet in this game are s. If you solo play mm, you can be kicked easily. Sometimes a group of 4 will kick the 5th unkown player in the first round just to play with the people they queued with only, and a bot. You can even get competitive cooldowns from this! Sometimes, people on your team are just , so they can sometimes teamkill you if you irratate them in any reason. People can also just 'troll' by not even trying the whole match. They can purposely stand in front of you to annoy you the whole game, tell the enimies your team's positions through chat, or more. There's no way to stop them if they have a friend with them, because the friend will vote no when you try to kick the troll. -Overwatch is a great idea, but not set up well. It can take a while to ban a while for a player to be banned after they are reported, which means the griefer/hacker can run rampant in the community for a week or two before being banned. -Cheaters everywhere in higher level games. Some hacks are detected by VAC, but not all. Most games at very high skill levels have a hacker, and like I saidm it takes a week or two for them to be banned. Then they can just make a new account and buy a new copy of the game. It can get annoying. -Scammers everywhere. When you post a trade on csgolounge, you will most likely be added by a bot who tells you to see his 'screenshot' which is actually a virus. If you click on it, you will most likely lose all of your steam items. There are many ways to be scammed, such as saying your skin is factory new while it's field tested, and more. Valve is cracking down on scamming though, so hopefully this won't be as big of a problem in the future. Overall: This is a great game, and you need to buy it ASAP. Worth every penny. I would even buy it if it was $60. It's great to play with friends, and it's fun to play by yourself. It's a game where you challenge yourself to get better, it's the only video game that feels like a sport. There are some cons, but the pros outweigh them. Buy this now!

(-TN-) l0ckd0wn;-;As a veteran player having played since beta 5.4 (that's the original beta in 2000), I have to say they've done a great job at updating this game and still giving it the classic Counter Strike feel. The Competitive Matchmaking is well done and generally keeps teams balanced, even with a wide array of ranks on each team. The new modes are great and definitely show that the devs are listening to their community. If you like fast action, round based strategic scenario game play, then you should give CS:GO a shot.

I then play my first competitive match and wondered why everyone had gold stars and ak's so i went into paint and drew one to use as my profile picture. Then finally i was walking around office slighty more experienced at the game in genral, learning grenade tactics and peaking ect, i then came to realise that i had killed quite alot of people that round and began to be called a hacker/smurf which obviously wasnt true considering i have 1 account and at the time about 5 hours game time, so thats somthing to keep in mind, Note to self: (Eveyone, when they rage call others hackers).

I also remember when you wanted to play competitive mode and weren't stuck with 14 year old little boys who just like to friendly fire. Since the game went on sale for 4$ at one point. Every kid and their little brother has an account now. If you are going to play with a group of friends this is a fun way to go. If you want to be stuck with a group of random idiots. Then this is your game!
Pale Dolphin;-;The Counter-Strike franchise had it's highs (CS 1.6) and lows (CS:Source), but the newest iteration was damn worth the wait. Sufficient to say, you don't need 1.6 anymore, if you have CS:GO. Game's 9.5 out of 10.0, a must buy.

Lonesome Lizard;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

Burt Macklin;-;Counter-Strike Go brings a new element into the CS series that being the competitive aspect of it, as well as other different forms of game types. For the most part, the entire game play of CSGO is played around the competitive aspect of it. Competitive allows for a locked in game where you must verse your opponents in a 5v5 format. The matches allow for progression in ranks and intensified game play. CSGO also contains the animated community market that sells skins for guns and knives, unlike previous installments of CS. CSGO has its redefined graphics of classic CS maps which gives a brand new breath to the CS series, and for that I congratulate them. The shooting and the animation of the players is very vivid and realistic. Connection issues at times may harden the game play of the competitive side of it and trollers and smurfs linger behind much of the game. But regardless of that, CSGO stands out with its new features.

Slug;-;Really fun game to play with your friends and tryhard on, takes some time to get the gist of it [if you havent played the CS series before] but other than that pretty fun to pop some heads and shiz. crap ton of smurfs recently but meh if they cant beat their own rank just means they got carried to it :P still a fun game with a team, buy it now while its still on sale or gaben will murder you with his nipple.
[YEET] -Oxy- Haunt;-;Idk its alright I guess.
Snowy;-;-Played csgo -Became nova3 after 10 games -got rekt for ages -got addicted to unboxing -lost money/made gaben happy 10/10 would lose money again
Le Lenny;-;I recommend this game for people who don't get frustrated easily... Pros: Fun and better than "Call of Duty" Improves your FPS skill by a lot Cons: Has a piece of crap competitive cooldown after your 3-5 offense you get banned for 7 days!!!!!!!!!!!! Has a lot of trolls that think they are cool

NIGHTxSHADOW;-;Hey everybody! I work for Grab The Games website and I have done a first look of what this game is all about. So come check it out and let me know what you guys think about the game and my review. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnxsHKv4nNI
Amygdala;-;Good game. Gets me 100+ ping everytime, note: it's the only game in that regard for me, got a lot of games that were unplayable. Bad community. I never saw that many kids, people that coudln't speak english in any way and just blank s, and that in 100h playtime. Matchmaking sometimes scrambles up the basically worst matches you could imagine. Camping is a solid stragety. Getting upranked out of the Silver-hellhole is literally hell. Every 3rd game has 1 smurfer minimum Hitreg sometimes worse than tf. Comp is perfectly built for smurfer and hacker because you can't do anything against them besides leave and get penalty or wait it out. A game that is bad for beginners, which supports people who play with pre-mates only and unless you actually get out of Silver and play with friends most of it is completely unenjoyable. 'nuff said.
wezu;-;This is got for you. Requirez dem skills, and you suck first lik me, but prac prac and get beter. I improved a bit. No more i Am lAST placee, i am very decent score rates! =)
Youtube.com/MrWolfWaffle;-;At first I was skeptical ... Then the game took away my time without me noticing like taking away a baby's candy and giving it cocaine while its looking at a bunch of kids playing with their toys . I was soon entranced by this game and when i finally got out of this trance it was already too late. 300+ hours If you tread through this land I recommend that you ready a mic and some earl grey tea because the game becomes so stressful sometimes that you lose your hairs... Literally. P.S GET GOOD AT THIS OR GO HOME !!!

Zippy01;-;A good game. But can be stressful 8/10
lego t-s;-;First things off, half the screenshots are from the beta from 2012, so keep in mind the game looks a little better now than it used to, with updated weapon models, character models, etc. Excellent multiplayer shooter, a good successor to the old CS games (of which I haven't played a lot really) but if you don't enjoy the classic defuse / hostage modes (which have each been tweaked and changed for the better in my opinion) you can always play the easy to pick up, more casual style Team Deathmatch, Demolition, and Arms Race modes too! It's great casually and competitively and the new matchmaking system means that you will always be put into a game with people of your skill level (in competitive modes). This is determined by the new ranking system that they also added, which levels up on a number of factors, but mainly how many competitive games you have won vs. how many you lost. The classic maps have been updated as well as some community maps being available for limited amounts of time in frequent 'Operations' that require the one-time purchase of a pass to have the maps available for you and anyone you wish to invite to your lobbies / games until the end of the 'Operation' (Can be compared somewhat to Call of Duty map packs). There have also been recent updates including the return of two CT-exclusive silenced weapons from the previous games, and lots and lots of cosmetic weapon skins and stickers (which can be placed on weapons; both from Valve, and more recently the Community Workshop), which can either be found in random drops during gameplay, or by unboxing TF2-style loot crates, where you can also find rarer versions of the reskins (called StatTrak weapons) which count the number of kills you perform with that weapon physically on the model. tl;dr: A good competitive and casual fps that is a well-executed update to the old CS games, adding lots of new content and is constantly being updated On a slightly unrelated note, the weapon skins utilise a fairly in-depth wear and tear simulation process, in-depth enough that almost every gun is unique in its wear and tear, which is very interesting, and gets bonus points from me!

Tuscanae;-;This game is freakin' amazing. The tactical combat in this game is outstanding and its so immersive it feels like more of a simulator than a game (obviously thats not a bad thing). Thanks to the sophisticated style of the game you rarely come across trolls and other people that destroy the gameplay. The one thing I will say is that there are alot of accusations like "he is a hacker" or "he is a noob". This is fairly rare, but even when it does happen, the game is still good. BUY THIS GAME- It will be one of the best games you get.

PyroJoe;-;If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place. Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
Pasha Gray;-;Fastest way to learn russian is by playing this game.
Dio is Rabbit?;-;Some people didn't like my previous review for it being too serious. Let me write a new one in the theme of Operation Bloodhound. This was inspired by TheWarOwl, go check his videos out. You play as an old joe who knows how to shoot expensive guns. You learn how to buy weapons out of midair and create a succesful life in a bright summery weather town in South Africa because you own a gun shop and South African firearms are  for some reason. Until, you're hired by one of two people. Sebastien Hennequet, a deranged counter-terrorist in the FBI more evil than most terrorists that wants to murder Chase Turner of the Phoenix Connexion, for some reason. Except for the fact that the Phoenix is all Russian due to thier radio command MP3s and Chase is not. Nice job, Sebastien. Or Valeria Jenner, an Englishman working for a Russian terrorist orginization focused on not being led by corrupt government. You know how they stop corrupt governments? By bombing nuclear power plants in Germany, holding hostages in America, and being overall idiots. So, this is a good game with a storyline involving a bunch of idiots. I have to wonder, where the  is Spetznaz during all this?
Lawls;-;Quick Summary about Counter Strike: The game isn't easy, it requires Eye-Muscle synergy; knowledge; quick thinking ability, all these can be achieved with a lot of practice. It's a team game, if you are a solo player, or those that blame the team for everything bad that happens, you won't have fun playing, and you won't be that good at the game that you'd be if you'd play with your teammates and not against them. Game is fun, especially because it has countless games modes. If you make your own team, make strategies, play together, be good at the game and have fun, that is the main reason why i keep playing this game after 9 years. Counter Strike is a game where you have two opposing sides, one wants to employ wickedness , known as Terrorist side(T), and other , wants to employ justice, known as Counter Terrorist side(CT). There are many different game modes, but these two are those that are played competitively in a professional scale: Bomb Scenario: The Ts must plant a C4 explosive at one of the two designated bombsites in the map, while the CTs must prevent the C4 from being planted, if planted, CTs must do their best to defuse the C4 and prevent it from exploding, as it would break the game, CTs can't pick up the bomb and run away with it, once a T drops it, only a T picks it up again. Hostage Scenario: CTs must rescue hostage(s) that Ts are keeping prisoners , there are 2 hostages every game, that spawn randomly in designed places of the map, CTs just have to rescue one to win the round, but they can rescue both. Counter Strike is a FPS where you don't play against a machine, a programmed robot that has a set solutions to your specific actions, you are playing against a rational organic enemy, this is what makes this game so good, because you never know what can happen! You must memorize techniques; guns spray patterns; smokes,flashes,etc throws; spots, and many more, in order to achieve victory. For a casual viewer, it might seem boring sometimes, due to the slow points, but for the player, those slow points , are the most painful nerve wracking, exciting aspects of the game, that builds up tension, until your mind fills up with constant thoughts of trying to outsmart, outskill your enemies, in the end, all that preparation, all that planning, the team work, the calls , it all falls apart, every single round. Let's say that the bomb has been planted, anything can happen from now on, every action you do, will influence the end of the round, and most likely, of the game, that moment when you don't have anything planned, you are improvising, you are making milliseconds decisions, that ability to make quick decisions, to do, not to think , is what makes you a good player. How i get that ability you ask, it's simple, that automation comes from practice, you are a product of your past experiences, in order to act without thinking you have to do the same thing over and over again, get into similar situations, do them again and again, that will make you become automatic. Keeping yourself calm in delicate situations will increase the percentage of success. The economics of this game are really worth mentioning, i won't go too deep into them but, they are really well calculated and thought. As is the 5 player team size and the time limit of each round, and there are many more aspects are really crucial. The game implemented skins for the weapons some time ago, at first i thought it was a materialist ideia, but then I woke up to reality and understood that skins have made the community bigger and more active, CS:GO has become an E-SPORT and it has a good percentage of being in the 2020 OLYMPICS , just as Starcraft 2 and League of Legends, yes, CS:GO is considered a legit sport by USA, what i find great!! CS:GO has been growing , and now it is on the top, shining.

James_Skyminer;-;11.3/10, amazing game, but there's a few problems. 1. It's not "Casual" and "Competitive" mode, it's "Competitive" and "More Competitive" 2. It should be called Counter of Strike: Black AWPs. 3. Demolition mode only has one side trying to blow things up, was disappointed. 4. There's a game mode called Arms Race, but you actually run on your feet. But in all seriousness, CS:GO is awesome. It's somewhat easy to pick up, but very difficult to master. It IS a competitive 5 on 5 shooter, and as such, you shpould take that into consideration if you go to buy it. If you do decide to bu this game, it's highly suggested that you have a headset, as listening to sound is necessary, as is being able to communicate with teammates. You need to practice this game to be able to enjoy it.
[FgC] Dr.Simply;-;This game is amazing, one of the best FPS with strats. Doesnt rely on running and spraying, takes more skill and focus. More than worth the $15, and on sales it hits down to 3.50. Definitley pick this game up!

Lonesome Lizard;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

General Pickle;-;Amazing I am at a loss for words really. Somehow, even after the onslaught of CoD games, even after the 'brown and bloom' torm, even after the Battlefield craze, after the FPS saturation epidemic of the last decade, Counter-Strike remains the best game of them all. Why? Because they did everything the right way. Where other developers are forced to peddle required DLC to players, taking $10 here and another $15 there, Counter-Strike has always maintained the spirit of 'You bought the game, you OWN the game' in a way that we rarely see anymore. While there are optional additions to the game they are in no way required to play the game in the best way possible. No DLC guns that break the balance, no exclusive content for special people who throw money at the game. The game runs smooth. This is rather sad that we have to think about this even today. There are many games which fail to balance their performance versus features, and there's a reason nobody plays those games six months after release. Just as Counter-Strike: Source redefined smooth online gameplay, CS:GO is a mirror image of the original with extra shine and polish. The graphics are certainly not CryEngine 3 level, but they are effective at presenting a unique style with excellent framerate and stability. The game is balanced. Sure, the AWP is powerful, and the AK is pretty over-powered at times, but for just about any given match there are hardly any times where you will feel no power over your death. Some people are simply better than you are, and they will kill you repeatedly... and that's ok. That is far more preferrable than having a n00b drop an air-strike on you with no way to prevent your own death. The AWP that the enemy has is just the same as the one you can buy each round, so use it, and get better with it! So should you buy the game? Of course! There is no other FPS game which can hold a flame to the addictive, fun, and gratifying nature of Counter-Strike, and this itteration of the series is no exception! There are countless community servers to use if matchmaking/competitive gameplay is not your style, and the mods are glorious! This game will be around for a while, and trust me when I say your money will be well spent.

TOXIC;-;Once of the best competitive shooter games ever made. Highly recommend to anyone who likes any kind of competitive shooter. Everything about this game is spot on and has been on sale for great prices. Some more of my thoughts: It's pretty good now with the recent VAC waves. I'm LE-LEM ([2 ranks away from highest rank in game]( http://i.imgur.com/VSNhYGs.jpg )) if i am putting in 100% effort and as of the past week there was almost no hackers in all of the games i played. Its great. The high level competitive scene is amazing too. The pro teams and community, IMO is great. There is some toxicity, but you don't see it as much in the higher levels to be honest and at least in the U.S, most of the time players are either just playing around or supportive and trying to be a good teammate/player. (East coast.) Also for the most part you'll just be playing people in your region, not many Russians at all most likely if you're U.S. based. The game does have its flaws though, but its definitely the best competitive shooter on PC. If you've never played CS before, yeah, you're probably gonna suck in the beginning. You'll get better over time by simply playing a lot, learning the game mechanics and also i suggest watching pros play. Also at higher levels in matchmaking, you dont need to queue with people you know for teamwork, usually at higher levels people can work as a team and solo queuing works fine. So perhaps, to get around one of the flaws of the game, make a new account and buy a copy of the game for a new account and just play the living hell out of it until you feel as you are fairly competent with the game and how it works and how to win games. Then play on your main account. Some other things to note is how easy it is to just get into matchmaking right off the bat. And how smooth and seamless it usually is. It's great even if you don't want to play competitively and just want to have some fun. But in my experience, you get the best experience by finding yourself a sweetspot in the middle. Somewhere where your opponents are not too good but they aren't too bad either. The devs are pretty good with updates and keeping the game fresh, but at the same time there are some things that should have been fixed and implemented into the game ages ago, and there is a small problem with the devs just doing updates that allow them to get more money (music kits, different skins, stickers and such). Overall, the game is pretty good and can be really fun and enjoyable if you know how to make it so. It does have flaws but a lot of them can be fixed. Honestly just make it more like Dota 2. And one last thing i want to say is that I think your experience will be greater with two important factors (for the most part atleast): How much effort and time you put into the game And how good you become at the game If you can become a good player, understand tactics and mechanics and how to play, and apply these well, you will, in general, succeed and you will enjoy the game. Let me know if you have questions, i consider myself pretty knowledgeable on the game and am fairly good if I feel like putting forth the effort.
S E S H;-;My opinion separately. Counter Strike Global Offensive, this is the best game in their traditions, but it is not completed many elements, it concerns Matchmaking, and anti-cheat, the game loses all meaning when the enemy or allie use third-party software to simplify the game (AIM bot, Trigger Bot, Wall Hack, Sound ESP, Seed Trigger, and other aim-helping software) I think for honest players it is the main problem and the game becomes unbearable, this problem should be solved by improving report system, and fixing the "overwatch bypasses" that hackers use to not get banned. In general, in spite of all the nuances of the game is very dynamic and fun, especially when playing with friends. (Recommended)

Fininger;-;1. Csgo is one from the best competetive/coop game ever. 2.Game modes: The two most populars are bomb site scenario competetive and casual. Competetive have good thing and bad I will try to explain why: +You can play with 4 friends in 5vs5 +Finding a game is very fast and very easy +They are a lot of maps for bombsite scenario and hostage for the bombsite one the most popular are: Mirage,Dust 2, Inferno. Cache and sometimes overpass. For the hostage one the most popular are: Militia and Office. +Most of time you are playing vs your ranks in 30/06/15 im mnd most of time i was playing against MG1, Mnd MGE. <---- Dont know why it is censored +The rounds take 2 minutes in a battle 10 sec in buying zone so 2.00+0.10 = 2min 10 sec per round +In competetive mode you have 30 rounds in total and you can win in couple ways: Winning 16 rounds, Enemy has surrender or winning 15:15 which can give you a half of a winning. +Most of time ranks are balanced but in silvers and global are most cheaters but you can get out of silver and in global you can play proparly without cheaters too because valve is still uptading VAC- Valve Anti Cheat system which bans cheaters Okey now bad things: -The smurfs are destroying the game and you dont have fun loosing 16:0. -The bans for the competetive should be longer or if somebody is leaving or griefing all time just permamently ban the player -It is very hard to spot a cheat such as bhop or teleportation(Yes it is possible) Now things about csgo Good: +A lot of game modes that you can play +You can get a lot of fun in this game +Game is not hard to understand +You can run it on potato +You get a lot of skins that you can buy/trade or drop and use them +Most of weapons are balanced Bad: -If you are vac banned you can make another account and cheat longer -Some maps are unbalanced -Sometimes Vac error is for nothing THE END

bbi;-;My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. To this day, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

Ultimate Nachos;-;When I got this game I was like "this will be fun". It was fun, but I also didn't get any pasta or any food for that matter. Why, why wouldn't valve add food to one of their greatest games aside from others of course. This is because of call of duty. Since Call of Duty did not include food valve thought "We don't need food with their great success". This is why Call of Duty sucks.
RELLiCK;-;Lots of hackers with Aimbot or Wallhack, russians, etc... I really did not enjoy this game because of Valve. Very bad servers (ping and tickrate), worst anti-cheat system (VAC), hardly ever punishing hackers... Don't buy it if you want your brain cells to be intact.

xX_Pr0Sc0p3r_Xx | trade.tf;-;Ultimate Money Maker of the 21st century. Okay, let's get serious now. This is my second CS:Global Offensive review and I am redoing it to explain my current experience with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Just like every other Valve game, CS:GO is a great way to earn money that you don't even need to work for. There are in-game items that are worth more than the game itself, and some worth more than the Valve Complete Bundle. Yes, and thanks to the Steam Community Marketplace, You can sell all of these at whatever price you want but it is seriously recommended you stick with what it's worth. No one wants an XM1014 | Blue Spruce (Field-Tested) for $400. They would rather buy an AWP | Asiimov (Field-Tested) for $57. But yeah, just the other day I got a Chroma 2 Case at the end of a Deathmatch match and i'm too lazy and too broke- to buy a Chroma 2 Key, so I sold it. For $1.28. I got $1.11 in return (Valve needs tax, right?). But there are 3 ways to earn money through this game and you will soon get a full refund price. No kidding. Ways to get money: #1: Drops (In-game items that are randomly gifted to players at the end of a match.) #2: Creativity (Creating in-game items that you can publish on Steam Workshop.) #3: Tournaments and MLG Pro (Just being a good player and participating in tournaments is fine.) I would go with #1, as it is really easy, but I can't stop using #2. It's addicting to publish content... Anyway, I hope you though this review was helpful. Now go  yourself and earn money. #WorthIt
xMidas1337x * CSGOCasino.org;-;I was top COD:MW3 Player and when i switched to CS:GO i recived rank DMG after 200 hours. Teamplay is the most important thing in this game, of course aiming skills too , but i played a lot of other games like League of Legends. In this game you need good communication with team because when you got them positions you can pwn them easily. If you want buy CS:GO it's cheap game , where : Teamplay and communication is the first improtant thing. Aiming skills needed too you can practice to achieve better aiming. You got many tutorials on steam workshop how to be better in this game. If you are new player in this game you should read about "Spray patterns and recoil in this game". It's also funny game when you play modes like Hide and seek or just Normal match. Playing Competive matches is balanced but in low ranks like silver and gold novas there is a lot of smurfs. Some times there is many cheaters in 1 month but next month they got banned so you need just to wait. When i started playing CS:GO it was very amazing game in my life. I recomend this game 10/10 would bang. Very good game but play on low settings you can achieve more because of FPS and have advantage on players game on 60 fps is ok but there is big diffrence betwen 120fps and 300fps. Good game Valve.

Plusnet Band;-;If you're looking for BS; this game is full of it. 100% full of shi*. More shi* than in India, there is literally shi* everywhere especially if you've eaten their curry. Your  will become the colour of jalfrezi curry. Anyways, the CS GO review. It can be classed as "addictive" as you just want to rank up and go pro and make some money. The ranking system is fuc*ing full of shi*, doesn't even have one. Took 5 wins in a row to go up a rank and 2 matches to lose the fuc*ing rank. Now I get teamed with the SHI*TEST players in the world, a bunch of dribble cakes. Just go BLAH BLAH BLAH and dribble comes out of their mouth while talking. Some people just can't play the game, they use the AWP and they couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat. Most games I am top of the leaderboard which you would have thought you go up a rank by being top of the games right? NO, wins is all you need. Doesn't matter if you're the worst player in the world and get carried by your team. You will go up a rank where as good players who are teamed with  players are penalised and go down ranks. So yes, the ranking system in this game is non-existent, matchmaking is worse than COD. In conclusion, this game is not worth the money. I would rather be a giraffe and play contagion. GG Valve
headbust;-;I do not recommend this game, But i do. The devs do not care about what the people want, only what to add to the game or changing pointless sounds. They do not focus on what actually needs to be fixed like The hitboxes ect. There was literally no point what so ever to change the ladder, bomb exposion , bomb timer. It seems that they only listen to what the pros want or how to add new cases or knifes just to get more money in the long run. At the start of the vac re-shuffle the game actually felt playable for the first time in a long time but, Now every game i play on matchmaking(or most games) have cheaters in them. Or someone wall hacking and telling thier teammates where we are. Or the that 80% of the games ive played has had at least two people with new accounts. its mind boggling to think that i have almost two thousand hours on this game and haven't stopped playing. Even after all of the BS that has happend during the 3 years ive been playing this game. But dont get me wrong im sure it is hard to keep up with all of the opinions that people have been saying they need to fix. Until something happens big with this game i will continue to be completely unhappy with the developers decisions, Also the game its self.

@krunyrplnyhvezd;-;As a player with huge heart for Quake 3 Arena I used to hate Counter-Strike without really trying to play it. I just saw that people really camp a lot there and something like running or strafing isn't a real option there.. But the the Summer sales on Steam hit me right into my head and I decided to give CS go a try. I've tried the CS 1.6 and Source too but as it is now, ppl mostly play CS:GO so I sticked to that. I spend quite a lot of time on this game, I don't think I'm bad.. guess some of my aim and call for fast thinking from Quake was left in me :). Conclusion: CS:GO is a nice FPS game, maybe too good graphics for me, cause sometimes it's really hard to see the enemy or to determine if it's a friend or an enemy :D.. anyway as long as it's a team game I recommend playing it with friends, because random ppl not always know what TEAMplay does mean. Have fun!

Hatake;-;Well, it could be a good game. BUT there is something really messed up here... the game crashes a lot sometimes. Most of them at the start of the competitive matches. And if you cant connect back in time you get pentality. I got 7 days of pentality now because the power went out and my PC restarted. I cant really understand why cant they do at least something that checks that you left a match with error message or you even offline from steam suddenly. All my pentalities (except one) was all the games fault. Any we payed for this game and sometimes i dont even had a HUD or crosshair. Once it loaded me in the sky a didnt let me in. I could watch the whole warmup but after that it ended and told me that i failed to connect the match in time. But I was there all the time...

Jaanus Aanus;-;This game is awesome, if you loved the older game then you are in for a treat ! The skin system is great, opening certain types of cases helps the competetive scene and because of that we can have awesome tournaments like EMS katowice :D Also, the ranking system is pretty good, altough it does have some flaws. Overall, i recommend this game for any FPS lover!

That and the fact that you can make your money back just playing through case drops in awesome. I have $150 in skins and its because this is the game you will never get bored of. 10/10 best game I have ever played.

-SkYLiNe-;-;CS was the game that started everything, it also started a thing called eSports, and CSGO will continue what CS started. CSGO is a skill-based shooter, its not like CoD where you just *point & click*, here, its different, the spray paterns of the guns make them harder to controll, unless you can manage to controll it If your new to CS, its NOT going to be easy, you would need to practice A LOT And my rating is... 11/10 well obviously hackers abd bugs are there, but its been amazing what the developers have done for the game. <3 Viva La Go!
poctaf;-;This game requires NO TEAM BASED EFFORT! I wasted over $300 on this game through microtransactions. This game turned me into a fat loney white child. Please buy this game if you want to be like me!
ko$ta;-;This game requires a lot of practice for begginers (I'm not saying I'm not a beginner). CS GO is an extremely high tickrated game which has been made extremely well. I suggest everyone into FPS should buy this and other kinds of gamers should at least think of buying. One of my favourite games. 10/10

Jimbo;-;this game takes place in a situation of a terrorist side or a counter terrorist side. you will either plant the bomb and kill the remaining counter terrorists, (terrorist side) or you will kill the reamaining terrorists and defuse the bomb if planted! (counter terrorist side). this game really depends on if you like tactics, learning the basics and of course shooting :). you will rank up by winning competitive matches. by winning 10 comps, you will resieve your rank (skill level). really this is an amazing game and i would DEFINATELY buy it for the cheap $15! good luck and have fun :)
GameHunter;-;Game is Awesome,  community,r00d peeps at trading meh... Just get it 4Friends...But if u play solo ugh... Dont forget 2 bring ur friends.
Darth Makler;-;Defenetly worth the price tag. If you want something more competetive than for example Call Of Duty, this is the game for you. but i would not compare Counter strike to battlefield nor call of duty since they have a completly different game style.

Baby Beard;-;Hello My Name Is a Lube Product and you should listen to me. Counter Strike Global Offensive is the bestest game i ever played for atleast 150 hours i did just get it 3 weeks ago and ever since i've been playing it over and over everytime. i just cant stop, i lost 100 brain cells for playing this game and there are many reasons why. Awesome skins that can we earned thru drops,market,trading,opening cases Opening cases depends on your luck and out of everything in csgo cases a Knife is best thing to get I have never earned a knife i spended ateast 100$ in cases for knifes but my luck is  then cow . Theyre diffrent kinds of Skins Special Rare,Rare,Common,normal (Also diffrent colors) You can earn sick money for some skins and items on your csgo inventory The rip off that i think is the keys 2.49 Each without case,Cases are separated earn them diffrently If you are a Vegas Gumbler you will waste atleast Thousand of dollars in this game There are also types of gamemodes Deathmatch,Casual,Competitive etc. (Including Community Servers) Dont confused your little head with this game with Call Of Duty Also YOU CAN BUY STICKERS!!!
lalka [no sound + no skill];-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive... Source engine game, the latest in Counter-Strike game series, following Counter-Strike: Source. New weapons, physics, graphics, and so on. Well, why don't I review it like I reviewed Half-Life? Because I don't like it. I expected more from a 2013 game. But I saw nothing new in CS:GO, except for new weapons and sounds. Physics, mechanics, shaders - everything was taken from the other Source games. Left 4 Dead 2, for example. I do not recommend this game for everyone who likes either both CS 1.6 and CS:S, or one of them. This game will disappoint you after 15 minutes of playing - it's just more casual. Easier to play. You won't use new weapons, you won't get impressed by graphics, you won't get any pleasure because of campers all the way through. So should you buy the game if you'll delete it almost instantly? I don't think so. But for casual gamers, this game is just what they've been looking for. Lots of action, easy shooting (very comfortable spread and recoil), gungame mode, deathmatch, and such. Kills matter, deaths don't. Just like in Call of Duty. I don't think I'd recommend it. But it's up to you to decide.
Bot Jerry;-;After getting killed 5000000 times, I finally got a kill. Oh wait, it was just an assist.
community hero;-;As a former big time Call of Duty player/streamer I found this game very easy. The players that occupy this game don't even come close to the skill level required to frag a game like CoD at a competitive level. If you've played CoD at a semi-competitive level, I would highly recommend this game. You'll get easy frags and there are plenty of lulz to be had from the butthurt kids that'll rage at you over the in-game VOIP.

Hyperchaotic;-;It stinks.
Psycho29388;-;Game still runs like garbage and pistols can be used as pocket rifles. Whats not to like?
Diskman;-;It is an okay game and could be lots of fun, but the real problem is the haters of noob's. If you are new to the game most are just haters and not friendly. This game takes time to learn to play and most are not willing to teach you, much the same as in Dota 2. If you are lucky to find someone willing to teach you then the haters harass them also and want to know why you are doing it. Sorry but this is true and if you are one one the haters remember you where once new to the game, and not all learn at the same rate. Try to be more kind to your fellow gamer and help them out.
Dennis Stanistan;-;10/10 would buy it for my 6th smurf account.
Kaynee;-;The best fps game
COLONEL HATTRICK;-;Amazing game. This is the newest version of Counter-Strike. I've been waiting for it so much.
GringoDingo;-;This game is utter . There is no tactic involved, there is no option to set up weapon sets, weapons has to be bought over and over again in each match, the community is a bunch of butthurt children who insult and votekick people if they are not going to do and play how they want it. Conclusion: This game might be interesting for some 12-16 years old teens, but is not fun for somebody who is about 18 and more in to tactical games. i can't recommend this game at all sorry.
Scoot;-;I played this on a plane with my sound up, now I'm on the QANTAS no fly list. Thanks Valve.
Paolo;-;Recoil Simulator **DELUXE **Now with cosmetic items!
Near;-;Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.
[J4CE] [Keyblder] J-18;-;Definitely worth the price, and a good CS game that is more to today's standards. The difficulty in some of the modes, especially Competitive Modes but there is something for all skill levels. 7.5/10
StacyScene;-;As a real life soldier this potreys a very very real feel, I once had my buddy's legs blown off from an IED. On his death bed I sent him a box, he didn't have a key though so he had to pay me about tree fiddy. Well he opened it and got a StatTrak Karambit Case Hardened, he's also dead now. Not from the IED. Don't let your war buddies open boxes kids.
Scheie ! Its Vinn !;-;this is a good game tho ,but ,yea, but ,did they ever thinkin about change the name to Counter-Strike: What The  ? i mean the macth sys is just so fked up and some time the other team just do the impossible  all the time like they r just drinkin a bottle of water and my team is like walkin around like those drunks just hade tons of vodka......
Sarah;-;Just take my money and my time.

Infinity;-;Bought the game, Learned native russian in a week
le cbt nuggets man;-;too many hackers and casuals complaining that legit players are hacking
BOOGSTINE;-;tl;dr : Counter-strike : Global Offensive will ruin your life. So you like RPG games sometimes? Maybe a good ol beat em up? Well shut your mouth cause once you get into competitive CS:GO youll never play another game AGAIN. Youll make friends that the second you get online invite you to play go, why? Cause theyre also addicted. Its been only 10 months of me playing and Ive bought it twice and have over 1k hours combined between my two accounts. Seriously dont play this game. (Obnoxious acting aside) CS:GO is the best way of showing how valve still can manage games (cause they really made someone else make this game.) in a great way! CS:GO is a game where people will hate, love and worship you all depending on how well you do in game. It takes skill devotion and a lot of anger *sheds tear*. Valve added a microtransaction system that all in all is great as it doesnt effect anything in game, theyre just skins. Thanks to places like r/globaloffensive cs:go news is fast and quickly fixed youll read about people complaining about the CZ so Valve nerfed it and now people want it buffed again! The community is okay for a FPS but the professional side has never been emphasized so much before! you get incentives for watching tournaments and betting on who will win. causing you to research and begin to love teams (Cloud9 :)). Remeber the above statement? It isnt wrong, CS:GO ruined my outlook on other games for the better I now look for more team based games instead of run and gun CoDs released every other year. This review is getting to the point where I should score the game though 10/10 Would ruin life again.
Rideout;-;This game is fun. It has a few good game modes to keep you happy, along with the community servers and the custom server mods and maps, just like counter-strike: Source and 1.6, as well like source and 1.6 people manage to take this game too seriously at times, so lets hope you know how to handle those types of people.
twitch.tv/Envro;-;By far the best competitive and most fun shooter I have ever played. Have fun spending $$$ on sexy camos! =3 Rating: 10/10
mike butters;-;its bad
Shape Shifting Ferret;-;Not your typical hack and slash game uncomparable to the call of duty franchise. Without team work theres is a fine margin for success. A player must be constantly aware of his enviroment, understanding the locations of surrounding vantage points and flank routes. One must also have the ability to listen for footsteps and with that information you can deduce an enemies location.Global offensive also offers a wide variety of weapon skins allowing you to customize your weapons for a more pleasurable experience.So far i have yet to meet a hacker and CS:GO remains suspensful and exciting at every turn of the corner. PS: whatever you do, DON'T peak an awp
Ravaging Remedy;-;I give this game a 8/10. Pros: Yet another Counter-Strike game which delivers in every aspect of competitive and fun gameplay. The transition between one CS game to this one may be difficult for some because it does differ. But, If you're a CS Veteran and fan like me, you owe it to yourself to buy this game. If you're familiar with the CS games, then you probably already know that CS is a blast to play with friends. CS games take skill and practice, and therefor it's really fun and exciting to improve your skill and display it online in the competitve scene. There is no other FPS that matches the satisfaction of managing to pull off a 1v5 clutch, or get an ace in the compititive game mode. And this is where the game shines, and will keep me coming back for more. Like recent CS games, this is also a FPS game with a long lifespan and great replayability. Global Offensive gives us a big graphical improvement compared to the older CS games and adds a few new features into the mix. Popular custom community game modes from the recent CS games, like Gun Game and Deathmatch, have been implemented popular in CS:GO as official game modes which I think is a great addition. They've added a few new weapons and gadgets, a bunch of different and interesting tweaks on the original CS maps and they've also added an official Competitive game mode too. Here you get assigned a rank based on your skill and performances. Competitive mode is where this game truly stands out from other CS games, but, here, is where most of the cons of the game lay. Cons: Firstly, Competitve and other official game mode servers are strictly locked to 64 tick servers. This will be something that many will find very hard to get used to, and personally, I think it's down right crap. Since every other CS game has 128 tick servers, I don't understand valves dicision here. Do they want to earn more money? Do they care? Either way this is a problem that Valve has to address, especially for all the competitive players who really notice the difference. Secondly, the VAC system. Now this my freinds, is the real issue with this game. And in the perfect world this wouldn't have to be an issue, but as we know, there's always that kid who doesn't give a  and decides to turn on some of his hacks/cheats, like the infamous wall hack, aim bot or trigger bot. Now, one should not have to want to play the game but at the same time not want to becuase there's a 50 50 procent chance to end up against a hacker in competitive matchmaking. The VAC system relies on player reports and people reviewing other peoples gameplay. Sounds good right? Well, no, the system bans in waves instead of on the spot, some people can go weeks with hacks without getting banned. All in all, this is a great game, and I would possibly give it a higher rating if they manage to address some of these issues. But I definately would recommend this game to newcomers out there and the veterans.

Robospyder;-;Truly a great FPS for hardcore gamers and casuals to be immersed in a very tactical, skill-based game where communication is crucial.

gaia.razus;-;This game is great like original one. CS style + good graphic. Only problem is it took long time to create a server for multiplayer mode. But it still better than many FPS games after all.

Since you are so ing stupid you might have a problem dying, so add me on steam and I'll ing help you. YOU STUPID FUCIKING USELESS  CUNTS.
Spanners;-;Welcome to the next gen of shooters, its a point and click shooter in which you only use one weapon (awp) and play on one map (Dust 2). The sarcastic comment is for a lot of reasons, first of all camping is a big issue; yes it is the players choice to do so, but there should be some way to retain this from happening. Its seems most players AFK on some rounds until they can buy the 'AWP' and then just sit there, for 20 ing minutes. I'm not exactly sure why people even bother using keyboards when playing this game. Secondly the aiming system is dreadful, who ever though of this clearly wasn't sober. Let me explain, the game states that you are playing as 'S.A.S' a highly trained group of marines that supposedly have been trained with firearms, although when it comes to shooting a target two meters in front of you; you can only hit it twice, out of a whole mag. Also you are un able to use iron sights, WHY? Although it has its moments (VERY RARELY)when it is enjoyable. 11/10 would get shouted at by angry russians again
stunt;-;The Valve Anti-Cheat System (VAC) Because nobody likes playing with cheaters. Playing games should be fun. In order to ensure the best possible online multiplayer experience, Valve developed a state-of-the-art anti-cheat system that automatically detects and permanently bans any player using cheats or hacks on a VAC secured server. What this means to you as a player is that you don't have to worry about annoying cheaters getting an unfair advantage and disrupting your game. The Valve Anti-Cheat system is only enabled on servers with the secured shield logo and only Valve has the ability to VAC ban a user. While server admins may choose to ban players from playing on their specific servers, they do not have the ability to VAC ban players. The VAC system is automated and contacting Steam Support to report cheaters isn't necessary. Valve has a zero-tolerance policy for cheating and will not lift VAC bans under any circumstances.
Coop;-;Literally the worst community of players
Colonthree;-;The best russian learning program out there. +Easy to use +Customizable +Good servers -Sometimes it's actually not russian -There's people shooting while i'm trying to learn russian. Would still recommend
D3LLY;-;CSS is the best in my opinion, but this game isn't that expensive so why not?
SuLt4n;-;Have to say this, csgo is a great game (a lot better than cod and bf) I used to play a lot of team deadmatch and arms race, since then I tried playing competitive. How I describe it: Rage simulator since 2012 Really, read this: If you are someone who enjoys life and never tryhard on games. NEVER PLAY COMP JUST NEVER Cuz the effect will eventually be you getting kicked by so called 'pro's' or you will get headshotted a lot and called out for noob and stuff so screw comp (I may sound like a noob right now and its true i'm noob and I don't give a F) note; I'm not trying to offend all those cs players who play in pro leagues and stuff and the ones who are good at it...
Tale Ducker;-;If you want a thoroughly bad experience filled with angry russian 12year olds who only know how to say: ", , mother, noob,  & your". Not to mention an abundance of hackers and griefers. Then buy this game. If you want poor gameplay, that punishes movement, with a great deal of RNG in terms of what hits no matter how you aim, even when standing still. Just poor hit registration in general. Then buy this game. Some fun to be had when playing with friends, but getting in a cue with less than 4 people is just horrible. Getting shiny ranks is some validation that your time spent playing this abysmal piece of garbage has not been wasted, but not enough. If you buy it for any more than 4 you have been fooled.
la FLAME;-;What can i say, Counter Stike: Global Offensive is one if the best FPS i have ever played (and yes i have play Call of Duty) but this game is really simple, its also helps your skill with reflexes and IQ. Its easy to learn and when you do it you will see how fun it is, although i think they should fix matchmaking, so people who actually like the game, dont get matched with quitters, laggers, trolls, or just in general bad players aka noobs. Also some of the servers are a bit laggy but its all good. By the time im done with this game i would have racked up 1000+ hours ( first game to do that) Overall Rating: 10/10
Syahwanius[Bodypack];-;CS:GO a great game , we can use all weapon without buy , we can see the skill without money right? so this is skill (:
Shadowducky;-;Lots on angry Russian men on this game. I like making Russians mad 10/10 would not be a Russian
Blender Gender;-;I dont get it what EVERYONE like on this game, its ZERO beginner friendly, the community and online players are .... (good i think you know what im thinking) Yeah i am a noob, but that doesnt meen "dont play the game" SOMEWHERE i must start but no you get one junky sniper kill or onehitkill headshots after eache other. What happend to counter-strike... valve  it.... and everyone loves it... shame.... Im not a cs pro but i know the older games was better, MUCH better, there you got chances and in csgo, everyone just waits until you running around the egde to kill you with a sniper, desert eagle, ak or m4a1. Was the money not worth, go buy "counter-strike" or "source" or "condition zero" or... "call of duty" or another game thats better as this and dont waste time and money on this kind of stupid , nerds , looser , camper , bad gameplay piece of .

oeretsoeL;-;This is a great game, theres not many bad things that I can say... The Game is great, and runs very good, few bugs/glitches, its really only the community that is bad, Smurf's, hackers, etc. 3/4 times I get matched with either a Smurf, or just s who ruin the game for everyone else, you know, those people that throw, feed, and just try to  off their own team. (Im not saying the entire community is toxic, but i've seen quite a few) If we could kick people AND Give them a ban at the same time, I think it would fix alot of problems. Of course, there are great matches with amazing teams that are friendly, and work together. Overall, the game is amazing, and would defiently recommend it, but you should play with some friends.
Jack The Trickster;-;This en game. Dont buy you will never get any thing good. All the noobs will get . This game doesnt even make sense. My team has like NERF GUNS AND THE OTHER TEAM HAS LIKE EXPLOSIVE AP ROUNDS THAT GO THROUGH EN BATTLE SHIPS. Ill play this game when there is an update saying that both teams will get GUNS THAT HAVE BULLETS AND BOTH TEAMS WILL HAVE ARMOR not plastic armor KEVLAR. But gabe will never do this cuz this game is so bad
Dem0n#AllSkinsNoSkill;-;Haven't played it much. Get it if you want, although guides on speaking Russian are advised. Also an AWP is not the best weapon for an eco round. #AllSkinsNoSkill
Bidrav;-;i dont think i understand this game...bf i get.... cod i get....lots of things i get.....but not this it confuses me.... 6/10 i kill my team alot lol
itsOmaar;-;By far the best shooter-game on the market at the moment! It is not pay-to-win like other bad shooter-games.. but the skins are a must-have in that game tho so you will pay more than the 14 for the game because eazy skins eazy lyfe right?
Briaaaan;-;VAC banned for being too good.
DAm;-;Just buy the game!
Ditendra;-;Well, this game has some pluses & minuses I'm going to mention below: Pluses: + Very competitive & challenging online game for shooter lovers; + Big variety of weapons; + Got lots of weapon skins which you can trade/sell; + Additional missions which gives you rewards after completion; MInuses: - Only few weapons have aiming/zooming availability; - Damage system is bad (You can empty whole magazine to an opponent on the chest & he still may stay alive); - Graphics ain't that good for 2012; - Very strict rules in competitive mode (especially leaving the match penalty. It gonna give you cooldown even if you get disconnected from the game due to error & you can't fix it in 3 minutes. Cooldowns may be from 30 minutes to 7 days); All in all, I don't see other alternatives of this game in this genre & despite all it's minuses I mentioned above, it still remains one of the most played game in my list.
Rafsterman;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a FPS where you join either with the cops/army or a terrioist and take out the opposite team. Its a basic Cops vs. Robbers but the objective for the terrioists is to plant a bomb in a certain bombsite while avoiding or killing the counter-terroists. There is also another game type where the terrioists take some hostages and the counter-terrioists must resuce the hostage and return them to the hostage zone. There is 5 different modes excluding community servers. There is Deathmatch, where u spawn randomly on a certain map and u can choose any weapon u want, in my opinion its a great way for the beginners to get started in CS:GO. Next is Arms Race which is similar to Deathmatch but u get a new gun every time u get a kill and when u got a kill with every gun, u have to kill someone with a knife which is kinda hard. Another type is Demolition which u get a new gun every kill u get but u must wait until the next round, if u get more than 1 kill, u are awarded with grenades. Casual is known as the most played mode which is technically the `actual` game which u must use the money u earn from kills and rounds to buy guns. Finally the most important one, Competetive where it is a 5v5 game however unlike Casual where u can see the enemy on the map and even watch them, u cannot see where ur enemy is unless u hear footsteps or gunshots. It is important u co-operate with ur teammates if u wanna win cause thats the most important thing in CS:GO, teamwork. As of now, there have been hackers who aim hack and shoot through walls when u cant do that normally. Many people have reported this but Valve has done nothing about it but make updates for their guns when they clearly know theres hackers and thousands of people hate it. I would give this game 10 out of 10 but since there is hackers and smurfs who pay another 15 or 7 bucks just to kill newcomers when its not fair, i give this game 7 out of 10. The reason being is hackers and smurfs take 2 away and the servers take 1 away. What i mean is that CS:GO servers randomly go bad making most people on the server have a high ping.
Vanseith;-;Dear Valve, As a fanatic customer of your games i truly love your company. from tf2 all the way to gmod it has been a good ride, but i would like to talk about cs:go and some suggestions on how to make our playing experience better. cs:go is either my favourite or one of my favourite games, everytime i play competitive it really does rock my world. but it can be a bother with your cooldown system. yes, i have been banned before but i havent left the match. its just that my wifi crashed and im stuck with casual for the next seven days. i wish for you guys to make a way to make cooldown less annoying cuz i also dont like being banned for kicking to many people by voting them of because they were afk. I truly do love this game but it can be a bother when valve initiates its cooldown system to me.....even if its because of my bad wifi PLS FIX I WROTE THIS CUZ I LOVE THE GAME AND WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER SINCERELY, Vanseith....a fan of valve but not a fan of cooldown
BustyBlonde69;-;too many s palying this game

Moose;-;Pretty good game, you can have spray-painted guns, and stickers, the maps are really good, Nuke is my favorite map, you can't respond on some of the game modes, it's like the T.V show the deadliest warrior, this game deservers a 10/10, Good Job Valve.
Nordic;-;Only bad servers in official matchmaking (64 tickrate, though 128 is possible and official leagues run with them), a lot of cheaters and hackers around with a million of fake accounts due to valve's failing anti-cheat system and their cheap offers for this game after ban waves. As a result you'll have to play vs. hackers or lagging players from eastern europe or russia in official matchmaking on bad servers. Another minus are the lack of good maps, only a few have be proofen to be playable/fair. Weapon skins are ugly and most of the time the skins are only new textures on old guns. "Stickers" which are placeable on your guns fulfill this "HelloKitty-Strike". If you have played CS titles before, you have to be disappointed. This has nothing to do with CounterStrike anymore but if you prefer to play a casual CoD clone, you might be happy though.
Good Old Hoxton;-;Community is full of s that are exceptionally competitive and most likely played the game non-stop since release. I don't really want to go back to this if the community thinks that having a life outside of Counter Strike is like announcing the Holocaust was justified.
Daex;-;sry my english is not good, but this gem is a fukking
all gamers are isis members;-;Honestly, the match-making system in this game is worst then COD, you'll rarely find good team mates, but you will find amazingly good enemy teams who are always toxic and rude. And get this, this game is based of it's competetive game type. The servers? Not even 128tick, talk about caring about the game. Also, i'd like to state the games hit boxes are just plain stupid. And realism? Never, the game's engine makes it so bullets are fired into possible direction like your crumbling up a cookie and throwing it. Pretty much the game is just so ing hyped by it's god damn community it's crazy, and they make it seem good, which in reality, when you get down to it, it's just mainly bull . BUT! good price for it.

Liam;-;Such a  game. Game goes on sale: More hackers, and smurfs. Community is . Everyone on CS:GO acts like a 12vie. Matchmaking system is ed. 10/10 wouldnt install again.
git gud;-;Infested with hackers.
Raven;-;Thanks for VAC ban. Terrible game from which you leave with a bad mood because the balance is "incredibly good"...
Barricadas;-;If this is a FPS game, claiming to be the leading competitive game in the genre you should have the following: - Proper netcode and hitboxes. Especially in hit registration area. If I shoot the enemy four times and see four separate blood stains on the wall behind him, I expect him to get four hits if I'm not suffering from bad ping/lag/lost packets. This is not how it happens on CS:GO. You can never be sure about how much damage you have dealt and how much will it take to finish him off because your hits don't register. -5-stack competitive mode. In this age of online gaming, I would expect to play with my team against various teams around the globe, which makes competitive really competitive. Getting thrown in with four  who swear in their native language and do random team damage, trolling in general against a 5-stack is not fun and I don't think it won't be fun for them either. -Decent community. Switching between this and Red Orchestra 2 is like having cancer, beating cancer and getting it back again. If your community mostly consists of 12-16 year old players who think they are the best because they get sum awsum killz and refusing any kind of friendly advice or criticism, or even formed tactics for the round, you can't claim to be a competitive game. -A competitive FPS game requires serious and especially strict moderation if it's based on random matchmaking. No griefing should be allowed, leaving before game ends should lead to permanent ban after a couple of times, instead of overwatch, which is recruiting everyone with 150 wins and Nova I rank, a professional or semi-professional team should be established. Without moderation, the game easily turns into Wild West. These are some but not all reasons I'm uninstalling CS for the second time from my computer (I hope never being bored enough to get back into it). I know that these points have been discussed thousands of times and my addition won't really change anything but I had to write this after 700 hours.

Lonesome Lizard;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!

RR;-;This game is a nice tactical shooter. Meta-game is really big. It takes a long time to get into if you've never played a CS type game before, but it's pretty fun once you get to the ~30 hour mark and start playing competetive. You have to be pretty rich to afford this game in the long run though because of all the broken keyboards when playing matchmaking with randoms, and opening cases will drain your paypal account faster than you can say ''StatTrak Butterfly Knife | Fade''.

Komplex;-;Counter strike GO has to be the best FPS game i have ever played. The game beats others as you have to learn each map individually and work as a team if you want to win. however there is one problem, to get skins you open cases and once you open a case there is no going back. one case leads to another 10 which lead to another 15 and so on. i would definitely rerecommend this game to Fps players who are looking for a great competitive game.

DRiFTED;-;just check my hours... my 6 month old boy is now 3 .... work turned into the dole 2 years ago i own a $400 knife tho... I NOW HAVE NO LIFE .... BUT ITS A ING EPIC GAME
No Policy;-;why can i review the game when i dont have it in my library best gaming community to date
Codeman975;-;To all who want this game I give some words of advice. If you have a busy life packed with many things to achieve or accomplish, I would not recommend getting this game. This game, even though one of my all time favorites, will suck all of the time you want to do other things with straight out of your life. HOWEVER, If you are ok with this, welcome to the party! This game is filled with cheap one shot deaths, P90 rushes, aim and wall hacks, smurfs, griefers, trigger and chat spammers, oblivious quitting newbies, impossible life-wasting achievements, and team harassment and cussing through every second of the game. If you want a shiny new knife, don't count on recieving one without spending at least $50. As for guns, you are kitted with stock police-brutality weapons, that can be traded for guns with more style or better patterns. New gun skins range from 4 cents to more than 100 dollars. Top those epic guns off with some one time placement stickers and your changes mean nothing at all (Unless you have a knife or gun worth more than $5). On the bright side, this game is very thrilling and time-worthy on the good days. You need to anticipate the opposing team's actions and work with your team in any match you play. If you set up a competitive queue with a well built team of friends that you can work with and understand their play style, the game becomes an excellent source of entertainment where you can show off your skills as a team. Being a game of Competitive Electronic Sports, you play a game that professional team gamers play, giving you the same qualities and giving you the opportunity to relate to what they do in life. All-in-All, what is better than traveling the world, busting baddies and defusing bombs?
Fruitella13;-;this game is very good

JooHyun;-;Bombs strapped on chickens and you have to chase them and defuse it. Best. Gamemode. EVER! Honestly, this is my favourite game of all time! I absolutely love it. My best friend and I pre-order the game the day it came on Steam and we loved it ever since. I still love it to today! I even bought this game for my beautiful and amazing love, thepandatasticgirl <3 198 Hours in , Master Guardian 1 and I absolutely love this game! Do not regret a penny or a second playing it.

Moon_133CH;-;Counter Strike Global Offensive is like that dog you wanted you have fun and you enjoy it. But there comes the bad parts such as the barking or yelling complaining and this new case system it's the lottery you never win. There are alot of good things such as creative gamemodes the strive to be good and someday be as good as Fr0est and enable console in your options and do the command cl_right hand 1 or 0 its when you have the weapon in your left hand instead of your right it helps me. Never Ever spray running forward with the ak Please Valve Nerf.

!#RIBKA.;-;The CS:GO workshop community constantly amazes us with weapon finishes and stickers of increasingly high quality. We have currently shipped over 70 weapon submissions made by the community and all together, CS:GO weapon finish creators have earned over $3 million, with each finish earning over $40,000 on average. Since shipping the first community case, we've gathered and responded to a variety of contributor questions. Common questions include "how do I get my submission in a case?", and "what can I do better to get my work noticed?". These are useful questions to answer for all contributors, so we've outlined our answers in the form of contributor tips below: Tips for Contributors Submit only high quality designs that were made by you. The entirety of the submission must be your creation; no clip art. It must be original content and if the work is the result of collaboration then every contributor must be listed in the contributor revenue share. The designs that you submit must be of high quality in execution. Showing your process is a great way to stand out and demonstrate the quality and originality of your work. For weapon finishes, consider making finishes for weapons that have few high quality submissions. Some weapons dont have a lot of high quality finishes submitted for them (Duel Berettas and Negev for example). Making high quality original finishes for those weapons is great way to stand out and increase you chances of making it into a case. Keep in mind each item in a case gets an equal share of the revenue. Vary the techniques, themes and finish types, and try to experiment with new ones. When putting together cases and capsules we look for items that vary in technique and theme. Technique is the type of artwork that is used. Graphic patterns and hand painted designs are examples of different techniques. Example for themes would be finishes that look Sci-fi or Military. If you are making finishes for a particular weapon you may want to make one with a technique or theme that is under-represented, or hasn't been attempted yet. Certain types of finishes are also underrepresented in the workshop. In particular finishes that allow for flexibility in the way a pattern is applied to a weapon. These offer players a chance to get a unique version of a weapon finish. Don't fixate on bold designs. Cases and capsules also contain designs that vary in saturation and contrast. Currently on the workshop we see many high contrast highly saturated designs. These designs can be identified from a distance but equally important are designs that are subtle enough to only be noticed when held, as different players have different preferences when it comes to broadcasting their weapon finish choice. Try making designs that vary in saturation and contrast. Sometimes making a subtle design is actually harder than a bold one. Don't forget about popularity. Getting your finish upvoted and noticed is a great way to demonstrate desirability and collect feedback that will help you iterate on it. One of the factors we use to gauge community interest is the popularity of a submission. Hopefully this information is helpful when you are making decisions on what to work on. We look forward to seeing even more amazing work from the CS:GO Community.
Sponsored by Tinder;-;extremely addictive game, would recomend for someone who has experience in the play style of a FPS gamer aalot to learn and can add toyour reflexes. there is a lot of custom made maps catored for different training excersizes including one of the big ones AIM.

Monte It's My B-Day!;-;I only bought this on the last day of the Holiday Sale, thinking that I would just shelve this game and sell the cards. Boy was I wrong. From that time preiod till now, I've over 3 days worth of gametime put into this. Very recommended.
Fury;-;Top... 100%
MadDoc' Lord of the broken maps;-;Counter-Strike is been always one of my favroite games and you should get it too :D

Macho Man Randy Savage;-;I offended the globe! Mission accomplished! 10/10
DaRkSOuLS#;-;THE BEST GAME :) No other words to explain :)
JasonLake <3 Matt Warden Dickens;-;Been playing CS for years and although I hated this game at first it has grown on me and has turned out to be pretty awesome. Still needs some work but it has a bright future! Best FPS game Period. COD and BF players Go Home.
Robawtik;-;It's a darn fun game, but there are some kinks that need to be worked out in it. For example, when I change a map I crash.
Pepe Collector;-;You can reload and defuse a bomb at the same time. 10/10
Delete;-;Cs go is a fedorable game the only problem i have with it is that there is not enough fedoras actually there is none which is a disgrace us gentlemen deserve to atleast have fedoras in the game but over all i would give this game 9fedoras/10
Radishboy;-;It is great to play with friends, but I dont have any so...
Nalle PoPo;-;Very interesting and quite challenging game, I recommend this game for people with good accuracy in FPS games.
Dao;-;I haven't played CS since 1.4? When Steam first became mandatory to play, which I boycotted back then. Anyway I bought this on summer sale last year 2013 and only recently started playing. I really like it and definately recommend this, especially when it's on sale. It's pretty much the "same old" CS but with enhanced graphics and new maps. Also there are new playmodes which are nice. Playing with bots to train is also very easy and perhaps even recommended to get used to the weapons and maps. The only "bad" thing I would have to say, is like on every team based game; your team makes a huge difference. If you happen to be against better team, you just lose. Not that loosing is bad mind you. I see a lot of players quitting when they realize the team has no chance, trying to keep up a good kill/death -ratio perhaps? All in all, a very good "legendary" game that you should definately try.
CritShoot;-;The best game in the world
game is trash 4;-;It's a good game. Takes a lot of skill, not just your average run and gun Shooter game. Has a nice competitive system, although matchmaking can get upsetting at times. At the early stages, Valve never really cared about the hackers, until a later date. I'd say 95% of cheats are no longer working, so the game is pretty safe, for now. 10/10 I'd play it alot.
SP;-;This is a game that needs skill , Not recomended to COD players .
Tuplapotti CSGOGamble.com;-;very good shooting game!
chad;-;Game is so fun and I cant stop playing but I ing hate this  man.
Braedonger;-;Totally skill based shooter, the only thing that is OP is teamwork, skill, and positioning.
BroDie;-;Really enjoy playing this game with friends.
CK;-;The FPS everybody who played call of duty wanted.
Gohan;-;really nice and fun game
sissilu;-;Good game buy it.
Kyshu;-;Awesome game! Not having played 1.6, but a bit of Source (mostly casually and messing around with friends), I think I can still safely say, the game has retained what made the earlier titles so fun and addictive (playing CS:GO 'till 5:30 in the morning, yay ... good for your marks :D (at least it was on a Saturday, haha)), and it has a nie skill curve which most games don't have, unfortunately. I basically started playing FPS games with BF3, and I got more hours into it. If you are new to CS and the maps, you will get totally owned at first. But don't worry! Play Deathmatch and some Classic Casual, and it gets better as you play! Don't forget to play Competitive, too, though, as it is way more fun, and the Matchmaking system allows for a semi-fair approach for newer players. (except being matched with complete  "every once in a while", the *Leroy Jenkins* type of ppl that run into B on dust2 as the first guy ... with the bomb ... and get shot ..) Overall, the game allows for loads of fun though ad interested in playing it more seriously, you should easily get a few thousand hours into it! 250 hours for me, and not planning on stopping anytime soon :)
`steezy;-;The only downside of this game is the amount of hackers in the mid-higher level play of the competitive ladder. Other than that, this is the most fun I have had playing a Counter-Strike since the early 1.6 days. If you love Counter-Strike, I would recommend jumping into this one.
Godro;-;People don't care if you are good in this game, they just care if you manage to get a 1000 dollar knife.
noT;-;top
cccccc;-;If you have the money to buy weapon skins, you will dodge bullets.
Hypocrite;-;Love the game. Completely one of the most involved team required competitive games ive ever played. Im going to have to stop playing soon. The kicking is stupid. People ask me to kick them because they have to leave and I vote to kick and I got a 7 Day ban from competitive play. That is . That makes me very mad because i'm doing what my friends/people ask and I get a ban and it is stupid. 1 Day ban for leaving a Competitive match I Completely understand. Voting to kick somebody and getting banned for 1 week is outrageous. This needs to be solved. Many of my friends have quit playing due to this reason. Im nearing that stage. Please Fix this.
M-Dawg;-;Great with a team of friends. Just don't solo queue unless you want to lose brain cells by getting matched up with toxic players and people who go 0-16 because they don't know what the word 'communication' means.
Silver_Fusion;-;As CS 1.6 player, I got used to this game aswell, 9.5/10 (Also knows as weapon simulator for Gabe Newell)
RON SWANSON;-;I would cut my balls for this game.
>.<;-;Well, i need a new mouse :3
BakeACake;-;If i had a dollar for each time someone screamed at me in another language, i'd still have no money because i spent it on skins
Delta;-;It's like roulette; fun until it turns into Russian.

Lonesome Lizard;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!
Sir Grayson;-;Knife = free Knife with paint on it = 200$ 5000 likes time to jump off a building
Enderborn;-;Knife in real life: 10$ Knife in game: 400$ 10/10
BasBasMalloy;-;Knifes on CSGO cost more than real life knifes
Benisthemenise;-;It is an awesome game but you can easily get banned on comp so you really have to be careful about that. If you are a new player start with casual and move your way up to comp, this is not like every other FPS this game you have to study the recoil and make good habits with your mouse if you want to spray. If you chose not to spray you can always single click for powerful damage. Overall this is a pretty fun and awesome game and i would sugest it for people and their friends if they really want a fun FPS.
HI THERE FRIEND;-;rely good game yes
Red Shamrock;-;Same classic gameplay. Way better visually.
Chase (trading knife);-;This is a very good, very unique type of first person shooter. Unlike any of its kind with the very competitive style.

Bandit 1200n;-;Awesome FPS game
Lazyssassin;-;After a long while since it has emerged from beta, this game has definitely improved from a terrible encounter to a fun, more competitive, thrilling, addictive game. Especially because of the addition of the ability to customize weapons for a more personalized experience, CSGO has surpassed many players' expectations to this "old" first person shooter.
Twsty;-;Great game! Great for skilled players.

VM.vistalu |;-;Virtual Knives expensive than real Knives 10/10
[XI]Colbac the Colbarian;-;Would I recommend CS;GO? Depends. Obviously it's a very well known title that almost everyone knows, but its a very competitive game and I wouldn't recommend it to someone who likes more casual games. But, however, there's still a lot of quirky game modes like jail escape and surfing, but then again some other valve games (TF2 for one, which is free) have some of those already. If you are a guy who likes a challenge and wants a competitive skill based game, I would really recommend CS:GO. It's got a lot of replay ability especially if you've got some friends to play with.
Mad-Hatter;-;cool :P
Towu-;-;Very NICE GAME!
Summitspaghettig;-;wow 8/8 would bang
elektro;-;pretty swag
mikki er fjallmyndalegur;-;i like to kill the chickens
Eswnan;-;According to the 223k gem bid on this game it's worth about $167. Clearly buying this game is a huge steal that saves you over a hundred dollars. 10/10 would click heads again
Myztic  (on vacation<3);-;Best FPS game on steam for sure, alot of hours killed during playing it. Not that bad community, some players can be toxic and flame ofc but you just have to deal with that ^^ Worth buying it, this will stay as top rated and most played game for a long long time :) Ratings: 8.5/10
Kettle.;-;One of the best 1st person shooters i have ever played!!!!
Newman;-;Great game, fun playing - reccomended to have a good internet connection and microphone

pleb;-;10/10 Would Bang

ReccaJo;-;Best competitive FPS ever!!! enough said.
khaNN;-;Awesome game but need CrAzY SkillZ to be good! Aim is perfection in this game
Icosahedron Prime;-;You get to shoot guns and have people yell at you. All around enlightening experience.
Reaktor;-;The great CS saga continues with CS:GO. A good upgrade from 1.6, with maps being a little bit tweaked with in a goal to balance maps to be less one-team-sided. It is different from CS 1.6 (some people still prefer 1.6 by the way), but it's not similar a tiny bit to any other modern multiplayer-shooters like Call Of Duty series and Ghost Recon:Phantoms. CS:GO is a game that requires the most skill of all multiplayer modern shooters, and teamplay can be as hard as it is fun sometimes, and that is what makes this game so good. It's not just about shooting people. It's a lot more about movement, planning, patience, and timing. One thing i do have a problem with however, is not a big deal (not a thing that happens all that often), is a certain hand grenade scenario. Whenever you run, and you get hit DIRECTLY by opponent's hand grenade (HE, Flashbang, Smoke, Decoy), you actually get blocked by the grenade and it distracts you from moving for a precious 0.5-1.0 sec. There is some argument for it to stay that way. I reckon if you get hit in real life like that, you wouldn't just go on like nothing happened, but the whole thing feels glitchy. It's a thing that should be fixed.
Sporty311;-;It's right in the middle of Source and 1.6 in terms of gameplay and feel and now with addicting skin collectables
ToFran;-;Just... buy it!
Joker;-;Very good game, recommend everyone to buy and play it!!! 10/10
Screwdicey;-;CS:GO is a competitive FPS with a high-skill ceiling and rewarding play. The amount of time and fun you can get out of this game for the price is extremely worth it.
Johnny BFG;-;Main point of game is to be the biggest SWAG of all time and best trader. Doesnt matter, if you hit . The only important thing is how much $$$ U spends for skins and how many poeple U scammed. And don't forget: more knifes, more SWAG. Pros: microtransaction (U can spend thousands $$$ for virtual knife) fair and clear to understand rank system really fair matchmaking system U will learn new languages, because your teammates don't speak english U meet really nice people, usually about 12- 15 years old, which always know, how to play operations (Its something like DLC, but after some time, volvo delete all content from it and u mast buy it again) realistic weapon animations best bots AI of all time awp (One shot- one kill/ quick scope- so when u ever plays COD game, u will be there home) great camp sim incoming nerf of all weapons hack are easy to find (In incoming update volvo implements them into workshop) Cons: some people doesn't care about skins and trading (They talks something about playing game and winning. Obviously they don't know, what they're talking about. Just report them for griefing) no spraylogos (I miss days, when connecting to server means download tons of gay porn from there) no user skin (My old material wallhack for CSS now doesnt work) its too expensive not enought hackers no hats needs more chickens MUST HAVE GAME. FINAL VERDICT: DragonLoreAwp/10
Waffle Man;-;This is game is awesome but if you are new to cs then you are going to practice ALLOT
Nilospanilos;-;Had Russians screaming at me 10/10 would do again
Turbo on Pingas;-;Player: 4 Shots to the head Valve: 99hp Good game, must play!

This is something you want for your kids man, this is the real deal. I can't understand why it's so cheap, it's like stealing! And the hacks are free aswell! Totally ing awesome game man, thanks!

BenXP;-;After having 500+ hours on Counter Strike: Source I thought i'd try the sequel. I'm not going to lie but the first few matches playing CS:GO I didn't enjoy it at all, but I gave it another chance and I knew what i was missing. This is the best tactical FPS shooter I have played. There is a huge learning curve on this game, espeically if you are going from Counter Strike: Source or 1.6 to this. However once you've got round 10 hours playtime you'll find yourself progressively getting better. If you have friends - get them on board to play. Competitive game modes are almost always won by communicating with your team. If you dont have friends - It doesn't matter - competitive matchmaking puts you up against other players with the same skill level as you, the same with your teammates. You don't have to play this game competitively, you can quickly hop into a casual game which doesn't affect your rank or one of the community based servers which are just as fun. It has something for everyone - if you get tired of the original game modes then there are loads of mods to choose from the community servers. Espically the zombie mod servers which is what got me into Counter Strike in the first place. 10/10
Scan me!;-;Really good game!

Popara.;-;Very good game, infectious ...
conf1g101;-;Get on notice some weeaboos play some more and find all the dank meme's 10/10 would anime
kingkurtis;-;Day one eh it's alright kinda weird Few weeks in learning the mechanics thinking some are broken Few months now you start to feel like very other game is sloppy / broken / needs the mechanics hits a thousand hours - most idle but god damn this game will consume you while hate it the glory of victory is too great and you can never get the same rush as you do in this more often than not this game requires skill over luck which is great. Still has it's issues I understand the desert eagles accuracy as in the older games it was ungodly but what it does need is a damage buff as it does effectively shoot sniper bullets so it should be slightly weeker than a scout - ssg 08 has the scope/accuracy and slight damage advantage whilst the deagle could be fired faster at close range and is cheaper also crouch accuracy isn't as good as it was early csgo they should buff that slightly as you can be crouching perfect shot (64 tick server) and it will be off at anything past mid range... I highly recommend this game but at the same time the amount of  you become aware of will make it irritable to play this game and any other shooter. Basically partaketh the fruit. Best shooter but once you get good, look into better than valve's free servers.
TinglyTim;-;I suck really bad at this game

XiCute;-;Probably my favourite game except for when you go away for a week you pretty much lose all your skills and have to regain them but it has a great community as long as you don't play in a team because if you do they talk  and call you gay and  but its a really fun game to play especially when u just block them so they cant say shot Kill someone with a P90 - "You're a fuc**** noob!!

Jokerstyle;-;Awesome game hard to master, I recomended this game to dedicaded players 10/10
[FC] HEDX;-;Just started playing and trading love it already.
karizma-;-;Very fun and entertaining game. I like being called a  and noob by global elites. I also like wasting money on buying skins and cases. I reccomend you buy this if you don't have it!
[LgG] Electro - Trading Knife;-;one of valve's biggest hits, counter strike used to be fun only when playing lan or with friends, now playing it online is like never before (atleast in my opinion). skins are AWESOME in this game, and the fact that you can actually buy and sell them with real steam wallet money makes those skins very collectable, plus new mods in the game. but to be honest the best new added feature to the game is: the chickens, gotta love em xD.
Fiddlarn;-;good game. if u liek counter strikez u should buy it. also, surfing is cool and the competitive mode too, but when valve adds 128 tick servers eventually it will be even better, 8,5/10
CRYT3KNICAL420;-;Counter Strike, a game where you'll easily spend hours on casual matchmaking just to git gud enough to take on people in competitive, where you'll get absolutely demoralised by the sheer god like accuracy and bullet placement of people from countries you can't even say without putting on an accent and turning your lips upside down. If you want to learn life's greatest lesson, play Counter Strike, that lesson is that no matter how good you think you are, an AWP will drain your lifeforce faster than a one way ticket to an Amsterdam brothel with an access all areas pass to the red light district. 2/10 - IGN "i mean, the sheer lack of any real console friendly interface and community blew our minds! we'll make sure that we never play any other fps again unless we are paid to do so. In other news Call of Duty Advanced Warfare - game of the millenium? we think so"
Pasuuna qt 3.14;-;4/5, Too many Russians in competitive though.
Amix;-;Always loved how out of all the fps games, I stayed with this one. It's simple, yet very complicated especially dealing with each gun's recoil. This game has been nothing but everlasting fun and the competitve matches are so intense and filled with excitement. I don't think this game can ever become boring to me and to see it still coming with new content like maps and gun skins is amazing! If you got money to throw, deffinitely try this game for it is highly recommended and you will deffinitely worth your money.
sa1nt #csgod;-;one game one love
TheAdmiral;-;its cs:go...idk better than cod
the jews did hanukkah;-;its a game
Braap;-;Chickens,Molotovs,Bad english,Dying russians. 10/10
[VexX] Psiclone;-;Are you ready to decide the fate of the world? The world has been split into a multi-verse. You play as either a trans-multi-universal terrorist or a counter-trans-multi-universal terrorist. Play through up to 30 alternate realities of which the most extreme team will win 16 rounds before the other and cause trans-reality to shift and cascade into a single unfractured multi-verse of which the victors decide the future!
Jazz;-;Played it on Playstation. It sucked. 10/10
Face it;-;BEST game EVER! So much action, skills that you need to master inorder to be those in high ranking. Get your friends together in a party or skype call and play competitive all day and all night, you won't be sick of it!
Mosssy;-;Best Competitive FPS on the market

Boden | Helfjiz;-;Really good game, buy it. it wont let you down.
Resistance;-;best shooter simulator
Rojokin;-;Very great game very recemmended
obull;-;Counter Strike has been an epic franchise since my mid teenage years. I have played pre-steam, pre-source, source, and now CS:GO. This game excels as all the others, and brings more the feel of 1.6 that Source lacked. The recoil can be unforgiving so skill is required to control it. It's hard for other games to compare to CS:GO. The quality of hitboxes and the fast intense maps (provided you know the routes and are not wandering around aimlessly) make this an instantly gratifying game. Despite the scandles in the professional scene, this game is excellent and hard to not recommend to any age group.
Rain;-;Good game, very Competitive
Fire af;-;This game is very fun and addictive. It also supports my gambling addiction by dropping cases which cost ing 2.50 dollars to open, only to get a gun that is worth 50 cents. 7/10 is my finnal score overall I would reccomend if you can handle not waisting away 30 dollars on the community market. The game would of been better without items.
noodle;-;While this addition to the Counter Strike franchise is very different from all of the others, it excels in many aspects. As with any Valve game, the community is taken seriously and even a major aspect of the game (weapon skins) is powered by the community. I find it to be a more relaxing game compared to the previous ones, although sometimes I get a bit nervous just from playing competitive!
Batman;-;This game is great! It is a challenge and unlike CoD, you actually need to spend time on it to become skilled. If you're tired of mindless shooting in CoD, this is the game for you.
theRIDDLER;-;I like the part where the heads go boom. Im 12
lolnope;-;good and fun game, worth buying.
King of yellow Youtubing Noob;-;This is an amazing game. It is a tad bit gory, but u can make lot of steam monies on it.
NLN;-;Its quite something.....
GodzillaBurger$;-;I love counter-strike, i have all the merchandise. Counter-strike is my life, my life is counter-strike. My dad comes in, he shuts down my computer and sends me to bed. I'm am crying now, i got banned for 7 days becuase of my dad, but it's ok, he is just jealous of my devotion to counter-strike. I felt a warmth, it was a T he siad," I'm planting the bomb in your A!" It hurt, mostly because theres c4 in my butt, but i did it for the T. My dad walks in and says,"This map is so T sided!" My A explodes I see the Ts ragdoll out the window. I'm alone now but thats ok, counter-strike is my life, my life is counter-strike
K3NIF wrong user;-;Good... Yes. Very premium :D
KeWhat;-;This game is the best game i ever played!
Ozan;-;let me answer the question in your mind : yes , they did it . its better than 1.6
Pronofilm;-;Great game!
Miles-dEN-kungeN;-;Good game after 200 hours *Edit: Currently 800 hours played, still good. *Edit: Currently 1200 hours played, still awesome.
AWACS;-;Play this game to sell items and to get other games. Long term investments with operations. 10/10 would economics again.
Nightwater;-;My Grandfather smoked toothpicks whole for his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, "If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately." Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- "Don't ever smoke toothpicks. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a toothpick or even a bean. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me autism anyway. 8/10
Basically KennyS;-;Case opener and rage inducer 2K14
Livonietis - Steelseries- -A-;-;Nice game !
Shalvazeer;-;CS:GO is a very hard and rewarding FPS. It has many things to put into play like the opposing teams money, will they eco or save? If you already don't know what they mean then by playing a few games you'll find out. There is a casual mode but competitive is where CS:GO's 'heart' is at. It's where i've spent most of my time, and I pretty sure that I have became addicted to it, playing 39.3 hours in the last two weeks while tests and school were still on for me. If you came from COD it is a very different game and don't expect to have your hand held or '-fart' around like many do in COD. It is a better experence if your whole team is either friends or have mics. Also you can get skins for your guns AKA camos at some low prices and even make some of the money back when you either upgrade your skin or just get rid of them all together. You wount get good easily, but overtime you will get to a good level. One thing to be weary of opening cases is addicting, you and alot more likely to beable to just buy the skin then get it from a case. I just get mine off the Steam market and it works just fine for me.
Baka;-;I shot some guy.. Called me a hacker. Atleast a 8.9/11.3 Would spend $1000 in keys for a virtual knife. Oh.. Still haven't got it..
_StonedKi11er_;-;great game
fakedaN1;-;good game would game again and again and again
Flucksor;-;Gr8 game. Careful if you play on cs_office Bot Jim will do whatever it takes to protect Pam from the Counter Terrorists. Bot Toby is  and there is no Bot Dwight wtf volvo? 2/10 needs more office
boring*AFK;-;Cool
BigBrownGuy_tv fan boy;-;Great Game
Col. BacoN;-;The game has much new Weapons, better Graphics, new or old Game modes and more. It didn't lose the Typical CS-Style which makes it good. Although there is two things. ONE there is NO Spray Paint sadly (The one i'm talking about you can post the picture on the wall using Spray Paint), TWO most of the weapons i used before in CS 1.6 like Desert Eagle which they nerfed it alot. For those who haven't played the CS 1.6 or Source yet then this Game is for you, but if you played the Previous Counter-strike games before, you might feel abit of sway Decision in this one, BUT Overall! it really captured the Essence of 1.6 in my opinion! Rated: 9.5/10
Cr3W;-;Very good game. The ranking system could work differently tho
Feight;-;A rather competitive game. A good game for competitive players!!
lets_roll_drew;-;Amazing game I would recommend it to anyone who loves shooters + Molotovs bounce off walls amazing logic its like they are made out of rubber ;P
Biased Milk Hotel;-;Bought this game for 15 USD Bought a crate key for whatever they're going for right now after 13 hours of gameplay Open my first crate Get the knife 10/10 this game has already paid for itself 10 times over
Abbas;-;Awesome game, definitely a change from its predecessor Counter-Strike: Source. I wouldn't describe it as an upgrade, nor a downgrade, but rather a completely new feel. Definitely worth getting.
SeniorSparklez;-;awsome game
Smug Anime Cat;-;It's
-[];-;Epic. Hate the frequent updates, but this is a game worth playing. Screw COD.

masw;-;Better than League of Legends.
Conspiracy;-;"You can break windows, disintegrate chickens in one hit, and shoot flower pots." 11/10 -IGN
Yuudai.PT;-;Almost no diference from source. You can get skins for your weapons by doing matches. You get ranked by doing competitive matches. You are always being judge, your a noob or a hacker. But if u have some friends to play with its a enjoyable game
Noni;-;So smooth graphic, and i really really like this FPS game,, recommended fro you guys
kon chu;-;I liked that the game was full of competitive people. I disliked that market weapons cost to much.
Matmo;-;Clearly a Call of Duty rip-off.
JL;-;Really fun and competitive multiplayer game that you and your friends can play. Pretty cheap considering the quality of gameplay. It only costs 15 dollars.
FoxxyRC;-;You go Pew Pew and people die. People die you win round. You win round you play more rounds. You win more rounds you kill more people. People die you get ranks. You get ranks you become real sneeki beaki. You become sneeki beaki you are then MLG Pro. MLG Pro = Much monies CS:GO Kill peoples ... Profit

PURPLE_PLAGUE;-;this is a great game 10 out of 10 would recommend thanks valve
Dante;-;Needs a better vac and to stop going on sale 24/7....... Other than that lol its Awsome!
Moth Jetpack;-;Excellent economy and great gameplay. Dont be intimidated when you first start, the economy is based around skins and looks. Because of that participation is not madatory to be the best player you can be. This is a must have FPS and it takes genuine skill to be good at it. Some lack the skill necesary and it is easy to learn. The best parts about this game are the learning and progression as you play it more often. It consumes you and you just want more. From a glance the economy seems pointless, "Why invest time in somthing that won't change gameplay?" It is another form of progression that this game is centered around. Each time I play I feel that I've gotten better. Clear Downsides You might be used to fast progression and it takes time to get good at this game That is really all of the downsides I can clearly see. I recomend this game to anybody with appreciation for FPS games, games with economies, and games with genuine progression.
Krispy;-;This game is great. Defintly recomend it if you like fps shooters.
Trentt0;-;Great game, but there is too much money involvet.
leStra;-;Good game for playing with friends, much fun, such wow.

BioHazzard_;-;really good game get it now
Flac.TaGGeR@4:30.Jpeg;-;Its a fun game if you have five people to play with getting randoms just kinda sucks alot of the time.
MrMagicz*;-;Wow, Thats really all I can say about this game. Now I bought this game for the econmy, getting into it and seeing how it would go (me being used to the TF2 econmy) And its absoutly phenominal. It goes strictly by the Market prices, and for once, if the weapon is cool and has a cool skin, it raises price! Not just some ing bp.tf  who say ooo 1 sale moost loower proooce noaw fer da reeep! No, no  like that here. its awesome. The gameplay is great, Makes me want to play more everytime. I really wasnt expecting this, but just wow. CS:GO is probally the best shoot em up multiplayer, but I would like to see in the future a single player, or even a co-op. That would make this game complete. 9/10
EpicWaffleWithSyrup;-;if you kill a chicken, it counts as a kill in deathmatch 10/10

$vi$$i;-;Awesome game, Slyfox sux at it.
Hey African, That's My Food!;-;Cs:go is a very good fps game with high quality and balanced wepon shooting. The other versions are more difficult to get in compepetive, but cs:go matches people with your level and i think it is very good.
captian butternubs;-;CS:GO is the most recent entry to the counter strike series, if you're not famillar with this series, its an online tactical first person shooter, developed by the good old people at valve, with hidden path entertainment helping with this entry. it comes with much improved graphics compared to previous entries.. you must be precise and tactical with your movements, the most satisfying thing about this game is mastering the huge learning curve it comes with, and be warned this game is difficult compared to other shooters on the market, but once you become a master at pulling off clean headshots with ease, mastering each each weapon.. trust me you'll be satisfied! Plus the game has workshop support, various skins for each weapons, new versions of classic counter strike maps (dust, office etc.) new game modes are introduced, whilst classic game modes return, and at a fair price, you could do alot worse, Definite Must Buy!
Huxta;-;You dont get better at this game, you only get slightly less worse. 11/10 would let valve take my money again
Flix #CD 7 Days;-;COOL game and its GREAT game.Just the graphic isnt that good,BTW Just buy and play it No CINCONG COEG :3 9/10 for now 10/10 after graphic is good enoguh

Naun0021;-;you can easly get some money for steam in this game
Ewick;-;One of the best shooters of all time
TehGamer235;-;This is a very good game,totaly worth it's money,it's a different style compared to Call of Duty and Battlefield and if you're trying to play something different,then this is a perfect choise
zack;-;Ever felt that you wanted to be apart of ISIS? no? well, anyways.. now you can, just join T-side!
Carnage;-;Better than CoD + BattleField combined.
Peace Bit;-;The game is freaking awesome! I recommend competitive mode.
Thanatar;-;I enjoy this game a lot. It can bring teams together and combine strategies from flashes to smokes. The challenge of mastering recoils brings you in to the game more to give more focus and work like a true counter-terrorist squad or the insurgent terrorists (please don't bomb us we love you).
k0re;-;Great game buy it its a lot of fun...!!!
Genkai-Ten!;-;Wanna cash in Valve? Add hats and you're in business 10/10 IGN

Poseidon;-;Road to silver :)
Ok[T]aY;-;i think this game is really beautiful game to think our mind and reflex in game
Bukkak;-;This game is in many ways the same as the older ones, but at the same time it's also completley brand new. Don't for a second think -Ohh, i've played a lot of 1.6, i'll be a pro in notime. That's not the deal, for you switching over to this game from 1.6 or source at first you wont be able to hit anything and the spray patterns will seem random. After about 500 hours i can say that this game is the best of the series. I recommend playing this game with friends of equal or higher skill so that you can improve together. Don't play with people who are much worse than you unless you intend to make them better. Great game. 9/10
Sytrus;-;Awesome game cant stop playing it :)
fr0zR;-;Never gets old, totally worth the $15.
QTown;-;such hs, much win

Smugul;-;I have fully enjoyed this game. It is fun to play and slightly addicting. I would reccomend this game to everyone who has played MOBAs like League of Legends and Dota2.

HVK Snoipur;-;The best first person tactical shooter. Worth every penny and really competitive.
[>^.^<];-;This game has taught me the ways of which config works best for my Cheats. A good triggerbot and wallhacks should get your glory to Global elite. You will meet alot of friends along the way and never meet one Bad person, they are all very friendly! I would recomend buying a cheat subscription so you can win every game.[b/]
dads acount;-;Remember that one time you went to Wendy's? Fun wasn't it? Well this isn't ing Wendys anymore, this is the real deal. ing Counter Strike. Imagine your fries and cheese burger getting up and AWPing you in the head. That would be some , and that's exactly what this game is. It's like ordering from the dollar menu but all you get is a  team mate. 10/10
HANDSOME SQUID;-;Really fun, but sometimes frustrating because of smurfs and hackers.
Donald;-;This game makes my nipples hard as duck :)
KiritoGaku;-;For all the hours on the game that I have, it's a game where it will suck you in until you get bored of it. I don't like the game because there are too many players that do all the things that people do in "COD". And for that fact I would recommend the game if you are a hardcore devoted PC gamer that has the time to put into it. If you simply don't have the time dont play it dont trust me. Im out everybody.

(   );-;am i allowed to review this game even if i dont own it
[AS] Farkus;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) Has to one of the best multiplayer shooters i have played it's fun it requires skill and alot of team work to win... even though I always get put in games with Russians... but that's not the point, the point is that THIS IS NOT COD you can't just charge at the enemy and expect to win you have to think of a plan first then if that plan fails it usually ends up with a plan B... or every man for their self. HOWEVER I have 1 major problem with this game... the in' weapon skins... we should not have to play loads more real money just so our guns look cool because we already paid for the damn game surely they could have made some in game money so that we don't waist our money we caould spend on more important things and if they really want to keep their money grabbing ways maybe they should make it so you can also buy the ingame currency as well as earning it because in my honest opinon... this ruined valves reputation for me.. now when i mention the ingame currency most you are most likely thinking "But then everyonne will just buy the same skin as eachother then" so no i didn't mean like you can buy guns seperatly I meant that it's still just cases and keys but with ingame currency instead of my real money... Wow I only wonder how many spelling mistakes there was in that... Oh wells this game gets a 8/10 from me because it's very addictive i just don't like having to pay real money just so I can get nice skins
Puck;-;You have seizures? Can't aim straight for ? Mouse is your enemy? Or maybe you're blind? This game is for you! This is the only game where you spray down the enemy by aiming NOT AT HIM (sniper rifles are the exception)! Of course you have these nasty one-tap-headshots but who cares? All you have to do is to put your crosshair BELOW your enemy and move it left-right and you're be gonna called a god! Sounds good right? There's more - ever wished that using terrain to your advantage could save your life? Now it's possible! A single wooden step can cover you from a grenade lying 0,5 m from you! Oh, and did I mention chickens? Counter-Realism: Global Addiction

::WST:: Agent38ddd;-;Looks better than Source + more guns! What more do you need?!?! If there was ADS, it would be near impossible to put down :)
OrNaM3nT;-;I grew up playing Counter Strike 1.6,Condition Zero and Source.I used to play those games every single day with my friends and I remember those days with joy because those were the good old days when we would gather up and lose track of time.The single most important factor of the game's succes is the competitivness.Everybody from the neighbourhood wanted to be the best.And this is why it became one of the most popular and most played franchise. Counter Strike : Global Offensive was considered by many at release,not a worthy successor of the CS franchise.The graphics,the movement,the weapons even the maps were brought up as reasons of the game actually being inferior to the old ones.But as time passed people got used to the game and learned that change is sometimes good. I feel like the game really offers a lot for it's price.It's a modern FPS with key characteristics of the CS games.The game does not forget it's predecessors. The constant patching and updates that are coming from Valve are making the game better and better and I personally think that it has surprassed the quality of the previous games by quite a margin. CS:GO unfortunately has been launched in the era of the MOBA and CoD vs Battlefield.The game has too much of a competition now to ever reach the level of popularity that this franchise had. Nevertheless,the game is solid and if you are a CS fan,you will enjoy it for sure.

Zsilfen;-;Really fun to play
Dovahkiin;-;CS:GO is a great game, with great 5v5 Competitive mode where everything is super intense, especially when your whole team is expecting you to clutch the match while your up against 3/4/5 more people. The only bad thing abot CS:GO for me is that it crashes sometimes, causing me to get banned for 7 days from competitive mode, which is really the thing I like best. You also get kicked for absolutely no reason on comps which is completely funny when you just start swearing and calling them r-e-t-a-r-d-s in your head. Overall, a great game to play and a must-buy
Kingus Dhan;-;I've played this game for a total of 2 minutes and can say that is without a doubt the worst game I have ever licked in my life. This monstrosity is overall just an adventure about two ing gay dogs who walk around and are just a bunch of inappropriate people in general. This game is not for kids because the dogs sometimes don't even say their pleases and thank yous. What the heck Valve I thought you were a family based company. Man I ing hate this game so much this is a game about dogs.
lichs;-;It's a point and click adventure.

ARASH;-;Counter-Strike Global offensive is a simple game , Its nothing like call of duty series or other fps games , no assaults , no air supports , no flags , nothing , this game is based on CS 1.6 (which is the most popular game ever) inherited all the guns from 1.6 and has few items added to It plus It has amazing guns , you could actually feel the art on your hand in this game , totally worth buying and playing 10/10

u2late;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the latest installment in the Counter-Strike series. Nothing much has changed in this installment other than updated graphics. Veterans to the series are going to love Counter-Strike: Global Offensive but newcomers... sadly I cannot guarantee that you will like this game. Even if you know you like the game, the very difficult learning curve might get to you before you even have a chance to completely enjoy the game. But it's worth giving the game a shot. To some it's too old school and it lacks features the new flashy modern First Person Shooters have; ADS (Aim Down Sights), Sprint etc. But in my opinion this one of the greatest FPS' out on the market. What most FPS' lack is a sense of competitve nature. Sure you can make bets and "CMON BRO 1v1 ME BRO I'LL SMASH YOU" people but in my opinion it's not enough. If you love competitve gaming particually in FPS' then there's another point to Counter-Strike. There are so many things that make Counter-Strike: Global Offensive a worthy game in your Steam Game Library for me to list! So do me a favor, do the Counter-Strike community a favor and pick up this game! For around $15.00 AU (Don't know how much in other currencies, I'm sure you can do the math! >.<) you're getting a good deal! Operations which are like free DLC updates but have limited time on playing the maps that are released in the operation, Skins which are probably the most infectious disease in a game second to the infamous Team Fortress 2 hats! and overall just fun! u2late approves! :D Notes: -Sorry if there are grammar and spelling mistakes! I typed this up without checking for errors (Sorry grammar nazis! :P) -Like this up if you found it useful so others can see! -HAVE FUN!

NovaLyfe;-;10/10 game. Love it.
And Vinegar Chips;-;Great Game
Nagasena;-;The best online multiplayer FPS in world from the best online multiplayer FPS series in the world. It has a great community, great support, Valve actually ask what the people want and put it into the game, it is extremely cheap for a AAA FPS (and it constantly goes on ridiculous steam sales), and Valve don't release a new game in the series every year like COD or Battlefield, meaning you buy it once and keep playing it for years (look at css, it kept growing and was played constantly for 8 years), the graphics won't blow you away, but they are still very nice, meaning the main advantage to this is that it can be played on basically any modern computer at a stable framerate, you can play it casually, where you can just muck around and have fun, and you can also play competitively and use complex tactics and stratigies, making for a great teamwork experience. So basically, go buy this game NOW.
adr1aN;-;great game <3
Existential Nihilism;-;It's a really good game. I personally enjoy it a lot more than CSS or CS 1.6, because of the new physics and weapons. There are some stuff that you could add or remove, though.

In all seriousness - do not download.

Stalaw;-;Valve is at it again, blowing our f*cking minds and remaining amongst some of the most respected developpers in the gaming community. There is a genuine reason that one annoying friend is constantly playing it. The controls are tight, the guns are much easier to use, but still largely skill-based (Except for the AWP, still OP  that ruins the game for everyone else, but I guess that's part of makes CS, CS.) Great for both old veterans and newcomers alike. 9/10 - Amazing

Im a gay faggot;-;A world that's dominated by many FPS games, each with their own unique gameplay and style. What sets CS:GO apart from the others? Well CS:GO is extremely detailed with every aspects of the game. This includes gameplay which branches out on to sounds, shadows and visuals, balancing out the map layouts and economy of the weapons, and the weapon mechanics are even accurate as it could ever be, the recoils, hitmarks and damage. Also not only the gameplay is amazing but cleverly valve took a big step into introducing skins. Skins are the main reason why people are now more interested in this game. There is a plethora of skins in this game, arranged in 7 subgroups. - Common (Consumer Grade) - Uncommon (Industrial Grade) - Rare (Mil-Spec) - Mythical (Restricted) - Legendary (Classified) - Ancient (Covert) - Exeedingly Rare (Melee Weapons) In each of these categories it is also in another subgroups of its quality such as: - Battle-Scarred - Well-Worn - Field-Tested - Minimal Wear - Factory New Overall CS:GO stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety. At the end, what matters is not if CS:GO is innovative or more of the same than CS:S, COD, BF but what counts is if it's fun.

Derpdiherp;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the fourth in the series of The Counter Strike FPS games. But is it worth the money? What Is Counter-Strike?: Counter-Strike is a FPS game based around 2 main gamemodes, Bomb Defusual and Hostage Rescue. In Bomb Defusual there are two teams consisting of 5 players each, the terrorists and the counter-terrorists, players who die will not respawn till the next round. The terrorists have to plant a bomb on one of the two bomb sites or kill the entire enemy team to win and the counter-terrorists need to either kill the enemy team before they plant the bomb or defuse the bomb before it explodes. In hostage rescue there are, again the same two teams consisting of 5 players each, however there are no bombs to be planted here, instead the terrorists need to defend the hostages the counter-terrorists are trying to free. Graphics: The graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are a big improvement over the ones in Counter-Strike: Source however are still a few years out of date as the Source Engine can only handle so much. Weapons: Counter-Srike: Global Offensive is a big improvement from the old Counter-Strike: Source guns. In Counter-Srike: Source there were very few competitive weapons, however in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive there seems to be a bigger variety of ballenced, fun to use weapons both casually and competetively. Gamemodes: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive adds two new gamemodes to the mix, Arms Race and Demolition. Arms race is Counter-Strikes Version of the highly popular Gun Game, it is a free-for-all gamemode where getting a kill ranks you up to the next weapon. To win you need be the first to go through all the guns and get a final kill with the golden knife. Demolition is a twist on the original Bomb Defusual, the terrorists need to plant a bomb in a building whilst the counter terrorists need to either stop them from planting it or defuse the bomb before it goes off, however there's a twist, much like Arms Race you need to get a kill to rank up to the next weapons, getting more than one kill will grant you extra grenades for the next round, the team that wins the most rounds wins. Competetive: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a massively competetive game adding skill emblems that and a seperate matchmaking system just for competetive. The skill emblems are reanks that increase the more competetive wins you get, they also determine who you get put with in the competetive matchmaking. There sadly only a few maps for competetive play and lots are in favour of one of the teams. These are my opinions on a few of the maps: Dust 2 is fairly T sided. Inferno is CT sided. Nuke is CT sided. Train is CT sided. Aztec is CT sided. etc. Camo's and cases: The case system is a new addition to the game, there are crates that you can find by playing the game, trade for, or buy off the market, there require a key to open which cost around 2 and when opened give you a random camo. The camo's are purely cosmetic items that are reskins of the original arsenal, the value of the camo may vary depending on the gun the camo is for, the quality tier of the camo, the look of the camo itself and how rare of a drop it is. Verdict: Counter-Strike: Global offensive is a huge improvement over the already great Counter-Strike: Source that adds lots of new content such as gamemodes, weapons, maps and the new case system and is a huge bargain at the low price of 14.99$, 13,99 and 11.99 8.5/10
Aidenb981;-;Absolutley amazing game. I may only have 4 hours into it, but that doesnt mean that I dont like the game. The game is a very competitive game you must have patience and skill in order to play this game.

cresto;-;Counter-Strike is my all time favorite game. I have spent countless hours in competitive play and enjoy the hell out of the systems in place. It's unlike any other MP game out there and has not been matched in the FPS genre. Developers are dedicated to the community, albiet on their own pace. You can play for hours and hours and still not perfect the game. It is a living, breathing game that continued to develop and grow both in the community and the game itself. SO much has changed since the late 90s in video games, but there are those few exceptions that last through out the various shifts in video games. Counter-strike is one of them.

PsL|| Gonz;-;Coming back after a long hiatus from the CS 1.3-1.5 days, I started playing Source occasionally. After finding some cool people and servers that made the game fun again, I was pulled back into CS and those long gaming sessions. Then I noticed there was a newer version called GO. I didn't really know what to expect from CS:GO but I had to give it a try. At first, it felt very different and I was put off by that. It felt like I was lost in the maps, and that I'd never figure them out because of headshot after headshot. I was dying almost instantly. So I started playing Deathmatch for a few rounds now and then, just to get a feel for the guns and see if I'd get a loot drop. Mainly I stuck to Source. Eventually I started getting pretty good at Deathmatch. I made a few friends and found some regular community servers I enjoyed. From there, the game really began to grow on me. Now I'm enjoying the Competitive mode. Overall, the game no longer feels all that different from Source. The movement and pace is faster, the maps are all familiar but nicely revamped, and the graphics are really good... but at the heart of it, CS:GO is still very much the CS that we all know and love. Going back to Source, now that I'm used to GO, feels very dated and slow. This was a needed update, and one I'm thankful for. CS:GO is an excellent version of our favorite game. If you're still playing Source on a regular basis, you really should consider checking out GO, and not just one or two rounds. Give the game a good shot at winning you over. Like me, I think you'll find that it's the best version yet.
cucumber;-;Awesome waste of time!
Jompa;-;This is a good game :>
astro;-;This game is easily my favorite game right now. The amount of teamwork needed to do well is really astounding, and it's really fun. I'd recommend this game to anyone.
Melpro Boy;-;I always play another FPS like COD or Battlefield instead of CS. I just try this game and it's very addictive because the competitive part and the stress when we play 1 vs 3 or something like that. We can get item drops and that's awesome because we can sell them and make some money to buy more games. It's a never ending circle. If you like FPS you need try this and see how much fun you can get.
xSax;-;Good game , well balanced Competetive game. Nut one thing i want to valve to fix : Crashing . Gettin 7 days of cooldown isnt cool when you crash while joining back to the competetive game. Plz valve fix crashing becaus i like this game.
danny;-;Like I don't even know what to say. Probily one of my favorite games of all time.
TheMarshan :D;-;This should be the standard for Shooters. Call of Duty and Battlefield are good games, but they will never be as good as CounterStrike. This game gives you adrenaline when you are in a clutch, gives you the satisfaction of one tapping with the ak and the sound when you dink with the m4. This can never be matched.
hngrry;-;worth it
nick;-;Lived and played long enough to be called a smurf. 10/10 good game.
ParadoxPL;-;I never played Counter-Strike before. CS:GO was the first CS I ever played and I love it! Great gameplay, good graphics, simple tasks and lots of missions. The thing I love the most about this game is that you can actually earn cool skins. You should definitely buy it!
Pablo;-;Awesome Game, try not to get addicted to the case openings ;)
tort;-;unbalanced please fix the following items : - awp
PsiKabaragoya;-;I would recommend this game, its easy to run and it is a heck ton of fun.
=CGG= Hyjack;-;There are little Chickens that run around the map and dress up for holidays. 0/10 Needs Animal Diversity
Paul Slattery;-;10/10 Would play again
DismaY;-;I've learned fluid Russian from this game. I also learned that a silver elite master can be paired up with silver I's, while the other team is paired up with Na'Vi. I ALSO learned that there are people who you drop a 50 bomb on in the entire game that turn out to be nova 3's.....WHERE'S MY GLOBAL ELITE ? Anyways 10/10 -IGN
Disheartened;-;I am globally offended by the playerbase, true to it's name, 10/10 This game is the fire that keeps Russians warm in their cold cold winters as your burning rage against them is their fuel. It trains them to take other countries that do not belong to them and completely ruins your opinion on weird backwards letter language causing it to become a rage-inducing monologue of pain. This game is so overwhelmed by Russians the word cika (or whatever) will forever ring in my ears due to prolonged explosure to them. Enjoy shooting guns at Russians and practicing recoil control for 200 hours before being able to hit one as every bullet seems to blow into a different direction until you know the 80 patterns which go all over the place; trained military hardcore badasses cannot control a little pea shooter and to end this review I will just say; do not even attempt this game, comrad. Only fun thing is getting Russians angry enough to kill you twice and get them banned for a week and hear them whine about reporting and banning you, which will happen anyways whether you annoy them or not.
Zelchie;-;Counter Strike: Global Offense Is a great game. Unlike most FPS games, Global offense requires strategy. It makes you talk to your TeamMates, This game makes you think, "Hmmm...Sould i go to A or B?" That's my opinion though.
kennyS;-;Counetr strike is a bit hard to get into, but when you step foot into the battlefield the game seems to just get better. May be better if they made beginner lobbies, but oh well, start to walk before you can crawl.
Timduncanton;-;Nice game
squiky;-;I really enjoy the game, its a clasy. simple but complex in the same time :)
Lord Limon;-;poo is good when its in your mouth
BOOM!;-;Great game, a must have for any FPS fan.
Bong The Crouching Tiger;-;Endless Hours of fun
Savage Meme;-;You learn how to play the stocks and gamble. 14/19
The Real Skim Shady;-;Great game, would r8 8/8
Kid Buu |;-;This game is everything in the world to me.
Arcaninesy | Colorado;-;I highly recommend this game. It's a very skill-based game. Skill, blended with gamesense, common sense, and lack of stupidity will take you far. Practice aiming in deathmatch or gungame, then hop into competetive mode to see how you rank against all the other players out there. Aim for headshots, they'll change the game. Use grenades effectively, they'll win rounds. Or blow up your teamates. With real recoil that takes learning and skill to combat, a wide variety of weapons for your personal tastes, and grenades that have the ability to provide huge advantages or losses, you won't find anything better for an online multiplayer game that challenges you. With a great compatibility for custom content on the workshop, and excellent support for those who design the popular content, you can't go wrong. Whether it's minigames, surfing, or bunnyhopping that you prefer, the workshop has it all. And probably dozens of other things I've never even imagined possible.
dont suicide;-;So I've really liked playing this game in the short amount of time ive had it. But, If you do get this game. You must know this game is full of tryhards and sometimes. Even hackers. (hur dur big surprise) It is the most love/hate relationship on the planet. You'll keep coming back to the game because its fun. Then get  on by some tryhard, or a hacker. Dont get me wrong. Its a very fun game with some nice people to play with, but the amount of stupidity is just so high. If you enjoy yelling at teammates over the mic as you get insta domed by a smurf tryhard. This game is for you.
CALIGULA @Japan;-;I bought CS GO for joy, soon realized it was just a ploy. Because the russians and polish soon arrived, ed everything up and the game dived. Dived deep into hell, but don't worry, i still have my P90 avail'.
K.;-;OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS GAME SO ING MUCH Except from the bans -_-
Zebra Studsaren;-;very good shooting game i would rate it 10/10 toast
Hostile_Hobo;-;I have almost reached 100 hours of intense gameplay, and im still hooked, welll worth the money!
Greezly;-;Very good game.
Italian Pie *MadCatz;-;Great game! but valve need to sort out there anti-cheat!
Salty Sailor;-;One of the best FPS in PC gaming! Good gameplay with great community backing.
Bankei;-;It's been 15 years and this game is still amazing. Although flashier games exist, CS survives and thrives. I strongly recommend this to any FPS player.
Lucky Starr;-;Steam should be installed just for this game.
AcidEU 524532120511212;-;One of the, possibly THE best first person shooter out there. It's not full of un-neccessary animations that you'll find in other titles. The professional scene is outstanding, not as big as other titles like Call of Duty, which alledgedly has pro players, also known as a bunch of teens who trash talk in a game filled with aim assist. Valve never dissapoints, even with some nooks that need improvement, such as the tick rate, it is a title that delivers. The graphics are good. It is one of the most skill based games, and do not try to get good at this game by donating to get some powerful characters. Gunfights, action, tactics, strategy, anything that you would see in a war, this game delivers. I would give this a good rating, as the developers still have to do some work to satisfy some. There is a bit of work needed to perfect this game, and that bit is a point that I will be taking off of my rating. 9/10, would recommend, go out and get it now, if you do not like it, than you do not have the brain for a skill-demanding game. Unlike other developers that have their games die out in a few months, some, even weeks, the community for Counter Strike: Global Offensive keeps rising. Valve do not need to release a stupid sequel like some other publishers and developers do, they know how to satisfy the player, and they do not need so many DLC's that cost as much as the game. I have gone past my point, I think you can tell I am in love with it, I'd like to thank my brother for making me switch to this from the scum that is Call Of Duty.
Brian Peppers;-;this game makes all the kids happy
Grim714;-;this game is the best
BriaN;-;When can we trade hats?
uninstall;-;dont buy if your not in for the long haul - this game is addictive
Sir Subby _;-;Great game. Just awesome. Now, before you take out your wallet, there's a few things you should know. First, this is not like your typical FPS. For example, you cannot aim down the sights on any weapon except the sniper rifles and the two weapons with the ACOG scopes. But it's not a big deal. To get your accuracy, you crouch, witch makes you crossair smaller, witch lets you pick off enimies easily. Second, both the sniper scopes and the ACOGS blur when you move around, but standing still will make the sight as clear as can be. For the ACOGS it's isn't a big deal, but with the snipers it's a huge difference. There is also an inventory, so you can trade different weapon skins, knifes, stickers, and more! Overall, great game. Worth every penny.
Lord Jeremiah Gottwald;-;Gay as f!$# 0/10 - Scrubs Bestgame/10 - Me
Zodiac;-;I love this game, beyond its atmosphere. All these trading floors and many more can make you a millionaire in the Steam

Bones;-;It's so good, games globally might find it's quality offensive in comparison.
GROOVY;-;10/10 would be called  blyat again.
Amity;-;Awsome!
Yuuki Asuna-sensei;-;This game plays so well, the in-game matchmaking system is pretty good despite what others might say. The graphics in this game are better than in cs:s, enough to be a nice difference but not enough to blind you. The buy menu in this game is a vast improvement over the previous ones, where memorizing hotkeys were necessary. The workshop and the combination of the operations makes for a game that doesn't get old. 10/10
Mentalist;-;This Game Is Simply Amazing ! From 2004 to 2011-2012 It has Changed Alot There are LOTS Of Interesting Skins This Game Has Improved Alot I Love This Game And It Is Worth Buying 10/10 Love It !

FuZionBoi;-;Really good shooter once you get the hang of it. A game great for players who love to collect things and build the best loadout. Great gunplay and good community. This game can get you hundred of hours of gameplay. Probably the best shooter you can get on Steam.
Lily;-;Good Game Ever
Yasssi;-;team blocks : the game
ZelWaldo;-;so good and i feel like eating taco.
ShoggyStyle;-;fun shooter that has a massive community due to the popularity of this game. the competitive matches are enjoyable and a good way to let off a little steam with friends. no pun intended :)
EZZET <HyperX>;-;I highly recommend this game, but not to russians.
Man's Best Comrade;-;Elite tactical anti-terrorist force that can't aim down the sight of their guns 11/10 would recommend
Hand of the King;-;If you don't buy this game I will slap you Let's roll-ol!
Spejz Shiken;-;Cs:go is the perfect child of 1.6 but 1000 times better engine and graphics. the different game modes are awsome! Demolition: small maps and quick games couldt be excetuted better. competetive: filled with idiots downing your rank quickly , the only way to get a better rank is to play with atleast 4 friends and try to take care of the one tard that doesnt lissen or speak. casual: good ol' cs 1.6 in a new body deathmatch: long rounds with respawn on the normal maps. you get to buy your own kit and try out or play with different tactics all and all its an awsome game 100% woth the money! 9.5/10 - a new must have on steam
Mangekyou[1G];-;Started from 1.5, went to 1.6 and now playing CS:GO. No regrets. Even though there are cheaters (rare that you encounter any), the game is ing awesome. 10/10 - Would play again
Justice|maskebmw;-;GOTD - Game of the Decade.
maiN acc;-;Really good game! I like it! (Y)
Capiche;-;One of the best game i have ever played, every aspect of it is great, betting on games, trading guns and playing against others. Recomend to buy it.

MC Rasta;-;CS always was good shooting game and people who like that type of games will like Counter Strike Global Offensive
Nepeta [Secretly a jew];-;great game 9/10 the only problem i have with it is when your internet goes out and you were in a competitive match then u go back and your banned from competitive for 30 minutes - 7 days is the range of a ban length and i was banned from competitive for 7 days because i lost internet and couldnt do anything about it
RIZADUGAAN1738;-;Love this game :) :**
AeroDX #NoFear;-;Dust2, AWPs and Kalashnikovs aside, this game is utterly fantastic and you should play it. The gunplay is fun, and the variety of weaponry, gamemodes and tactics at your disposal - coupled with the ludicrous amount of skins and stickers available - makes it all the better. TL;DR: This game is Zozey approved.
EvilDonutz;-;one of the best game ever!!! its just that stuffs are freaking expensive :((
bebyno;-;Very good game! Just a tip: never play with random team in ranked game.
|D:C| Jimmy;-;Just use the AWP
shauniok;-;I love this game

the milk man;-;This game is really good. The stratedgies and everything u hve to do really makes it a good FPS. The style of the game as well flows well with the gmae itself.
Kriss.FPS;-;Clearly for all FPS gamers out there, this must be almost perfect for you And to non FPS enthusiasts, you can play it as soon as you know how to shoot and aim the target. Semper fi!
Fluffles;-;It's always nice to kill people while getting screamed at by Russians. 10/10.
RevCrew;-;When you look at the game and play it then you will know what value CS:GO
The Winds of Shit;-;Delivering democracy, killing terrorist scum, and eliminating the feds, how much better does it get than that?
Epic [H] True 90/10;-;AMAZING GAME LOVE IT

FreX;-;The best shooter out there
| Ranburub;-;Very good, skill/teambased game! Nice community and good gameplay! #everytimeagoodtime
Jon Snow;-;very good fun and pesonaly favorite fps, i like the fact that you can play different modes from sneaking to gund blazing and it requires startegy.
Shiv'nAndShank'n;-;This game offers modes for the casual player and the competitve gamer. It is very easy to get into the game, as one can master the guns without playing competitive mode by several game modes, namely Arms Race, Deathmatch, and Casual Classic. The high skill floor is high, but it is a very good game overall. The servers, though... Valve, please change them back. Please...
[CHLN];-;Like teamwork? Like strategy? Ya like shooting at ? Good. Me 2. T's/CT's
mikebwin22;-;The number of first person shooters out on consoles and PC are numerous and they tend to come out every year. If you're into run and gun type of shooters where a microphone really isn't necessary, by all means keep playing those games. However, CS:GO is a very addicting team based shooter, however unrealistic it is. It is a classic shooter that reminds people of their childhood, gunning away on 1.6 or source. If you have friends who play this game, might as well buy it and start talking in jargon that makes everyone give you strange looks. And just a tip, if you have anger issues, please for the love of God, never solo queue in MM. PLEASE.
DudeDesigns;-;*plays deathmatch* wow er stop using this gun. play the game right ok kills him again wow er you have no skill. use the knife. stop using the auto sniper. you cant ing play this game you ing er  sucker. I bet you suck  in real life er.
faces_-;-;Fun but meowzor is horrible.
Figueiroa24;-;Very nice game! ;)
People's Republic of Chad;-;Great game, may be repetative but it certainly doesnt get stale.
Reaper;-;The enjoyment of the game comes from being able to many things that are not accesible in other fps and strategy games. Counter Strike Global Offensive is one of my personel favorties becaus eof the amazing fps action and the strategy behind the plan of attack. There is a lack to the game though, but it shouldnt affect how you play. The competitive matchmaking, the people who play competitive arent always what you'd expect in sych an amazing game but those types of people are always going to be there.
No7pol;-;great game 10/10
iNF;-;Buy game Get to DMG Stay on DMG forever 10/10

Anakin Dankwalker;-;Considering I spend all my money on cases and stickers and have no time for other things I would say this game is good.
bilbo.-;-;The one and only competitive shooter out there... The one and only rage introducing shooter out there... The one and only shooter where you can interact with verious kind of cheaters. In case your blood preasure is too low, play a view rounds on the very well optimized servers - against any people from everywhere around the world. Play it, rage quit, play again, repeat. 10/10 would buy again. WARNING: This game can cause a major lost on braincells, anger, hate and auto-aggressive disorder. Play with caution... or leave it.
elNiNo;-;need more skin drops tho. and more quality in case openings lel
Dejection;-;I find it funny how the new CS is still cheaper than the old one.

Iggzz.;-;Highly recommend this game. Can be either fast or slow paced depending on what mode you play. Competitive MM is abit of a mess at the moment but it can only improve.
Fairuz;-;Better than COD
alligatore;-;This game is great. The graphics are nice and the gameplay is fun and it's easy to understand. The maps are creative and nice.
Eccentric (Leaving 4 1week @Fri);-;Fun stuff, with a caveat: This game is Pay2Win . If you don't open the buy menu and pay for your weapons you're likely to lose.
f0rK;-;Best competitive shooter hands down.
Brodosynthesis;-;Showing CoD fanboys a real fps since the dawn of the genre, CS:GO provides a real challenge and never ceases to be fun! If you enjoy a life without knowing what the sun looks like, buy this life-ruining bargain!

Red Card For Hacking :D;-;It's a great game, lot's of fun. Try not to get addicted to opening crates lol
Nigel Farage;-;CS : GO Is a competative first person shooter which takes skill and time to master.
snomag;-;Buying ingame skins for 100+euros? Playing 4v5 MM constantly because someone's bedtime passed and has to leave? (guaranteed it happens 2mins into the game) Russians? What else could you wish for? Also, who needs a life anyway. 10/10 would chicken.
x[i]le;-;ed over my life the reason i have no gf and sit in my room all day but it was worth it i have my epic skins <3
Leeroy Senpai;-;A great game. A true first person shooter, requiring: Skill, Knowledge, and practice. A true legend of the Counter Strike series. I'd give it 100% reccommendation, and would gladly pay full AAA price for the hours of fun and frustration this game has.
uhivra;-;it was OK
*|* oAk *|* @BoraPlayar;-;For those who are sons of the Half-life Generation! Counter-Strike as it always was, but with very good graphics and physics.
hestia;-;This game is very, very, very, VERY god. I am godspeed in this game. Tec-9 is God Speed in this game. Safari Mesh is the only good skin. I am god here.
BrTK;-;good for trickshots 11/10 -IGN
-=K=-;-;For anyone into tactical FPS in a team setting; then CS GO competitive is right for you. Games can be challenging, tense, but you have to remember it's just a game and that you're really playing to enjoy it; win or lose. Overall, great game.
Deandra "Sweet Dee" Reynolds;-;This is a very fun game. If you enjoy competative, strategic, and untimately time consuming games, play this!
SUPER KAWAII DESU DESU ^0^;-;if you are a tryhard cod player this game is for you.
Auto-Sama;-;Good game! You want to spend money because some of the gun skins are straight out amazing and remember, DON'T BET IT IS SO TRICKY! 5/5 Game worth the buy.
Chiller252;-;If you enjoy conventional FPS games and the way they work and you expect this game to behave in the same way, you will probably rage quit within the first 10-30 minutes of playing. You have to be willing to learn how Counter-Strike differs from other FPS games and you have to be willing to explore new tactics. The weapons in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive all have their own unique spray pattern (recoil pattern) which rises above the reticle while spraying an automatic weapon. If you don't learn these spray patterns, you will keep aiming at players, but you will miss every shot over the enemies head. Also, the in-game purchases are not pay-to-win; rather they allow users to equip weapons based on pure ascetics alone. Also, the weapon skins can be very rare and go for hundreds to thousands of dollars in the market. When you start playing, you will have to play to learn and improve. After some time making mistakes and getting-owned you will see improvement and at some point you can start playing in the competitive game mode which has a penalty for leaving. Overall, I really enjoy this game. The community is better than I expected and is superior compared to the community of COD or Battlefield. At the competitive level, mic spamming becomes non-existent (except in extreme situations) and if you confront a player with a knife it is most likely that they will also pull out their knife to engage you in a knife fight, otherwise its dishonorable. It takes some time getting used to but its great once you can appreciate the acquired tasted that comes with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
3LAU;-;Nice game :D
Unicorn;-;Great game
xo;-;Very great game, But i dont like the people in it. Their kinda mean and things,When you see a 12 years old they all start callin him bad words, Wich is Like really annoying But overall Best game Ever, Really should buy it if you dont have it.
.nme.;-;good, but glitchy after major updates.
//DANNY_BOY.exe;-;I recomend this to anyone who loves the simple and stable shooter expirience. (be careful thoug, can steal your life =P)
Fuck This Game;-;this game is so good irecommend this for fps gamers.
[LoL] TheReborn;-;Favorite and most realistic fps recommend 2 anyone :p u can play minigames, jailbreak, surf, hostage rescue, and search and destroy
DuMPeR ThUmPEr;-;This game is pretty nice, it's not as hard to learn as cs:s was, probably because it's meant for ing consoles. other than that it's pretty nice.
PunisheR;-;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive doesn't need any introduction. Counter-Strike is one of the most popular franchises on PC. Global Offensive brought a new look to it, literally. Graphics were tweaked to "battle" against the other modernized FPS games who were already on the market or coming near to release. The classic and old maps from the previous Counter-Strikes' are polished to match the game quality and are actually still enjoyable. You still have the feeling you are playing Counter-Strike, even if the characters voices were completely changed. In the terms of gameplay, nothing much has changed, besides the HUD/UI. Global Offensive, like the previous ones, is a competitive tactical shooter. The new incendiary grenade on this game gives it a nice touch, but it can lead you to a terrible loss of frame-rate if you have a weak computer. (as well as smokes and flashbangs sometimes) What we can really call "new", is the ability to find official matches to play on the official CS:GO servers. The matchmaking system brings a new life to the game when it comes to play with friends, or just make your way to the top rankings by winning official ranked matches. CS:GO allows you to make a specific lobby for any mode and map you wish to play and, the best part, WITH friends! In every previous CS games, I sometimes had the feeling that I would have to be very lucky to find, not only, a server that I was exactly looking for, and with slots enough to play with my friends (in the same team). The CS:GO matchmaking eliminates this hassle and makes everything faster and easier. I still dislike not being able to tell the game how many players you are looking for. (for example: 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4, and so on) You can still join player created dedicted servers just like you did in the previous Counter-Strikes', so don't worry. :) The ability to watch other players matches (friends or not) with a 30 second delay was a nice play by the developers. You can now safely play a match without worrying about spectators helping someone on the opposite side team. And above all it allows you to watch some popular clans and pro players battle each other, which is always enjoyable to watch. (like tournaments happening in that moment) Which then leads to one of the biggest problems on every multiplayer game: cheaters. CS:GO came with an idea to make the most skilled and trusted players in the community to spectate a "suspect" player to determine if he is cheating or not, called "Overwatch". I must say, this is absolutely brilliant, giving the fact that this system doesn't allow you to know the "suspect" true nicknames or steam account nor the rest of the players in that match. To finish this review, I would like to point out a very nice addon in the game, which is, players created content in the game. CS:GO allows you to create your own: maps, weapon skins, and so on. And lets other players download and use it directly in their game. You can then comment or vote that creation. There are weapon skins that are "paid to get" and doesn't give you any advantage, it's just fashionable. But sometimes the animations are so cool or the colours are so awesome, that Valve decides to put them in Loot boxes with very rare and low drop percentage, so if you get one of these, you can either use it and brag about it, sell to other players, or trade for anything you want with other players. Conclusion: If you enjoyed the Counter-Strike franchise, or love a competitive skilled-oriented FPS, I recommend you give CS:GO a try, if you have the recommended System Requirements. If you're looking for an easy, simple FPS game, don't buy this game. 8/10
Rythian;-;Awesome game. Recommended for those Hardcore FPS gamers.
YodlarN;-;This is a real fun game for both older and younger :D
UNAVAILABLE UNTIL NOTICE;-;Allows me to be a terrorist without disturbing the Americans.
Der Perverse Krckstockopa;-;many achievement! very fun!
Ztaal3;-;This is the game that is fair no mather how long you have been playing, no buying to level up or unfair atvatadges just fair gaming and fun. The bad thing is there are a lot of people ''smurfing'', they play on high ranks and get really good then make a secondary account to go play and just ruin the game for the one with lower rank.. This is a real problem all along the lines of cheating and is making online matchmaking a real hell...

Doppit The Stressy Dragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love...

Allahu Akbar;-;Wow! Very impressed with this game! I have played it for a couple of months now and I have had no problems with it. The odd hacker or two does make the game less enjoyable, but every hacker I have reported has been dealt with appropriately. love the customizability too, from crosshairs to painted weapons. The economy in the game is very good too. I personally enjoy the competitive gamemode. If I were you, I'd buy it, It's only 12 quid, why not give it a try?
queer;-;this is counter strike: source, it's a video game. 10/10 it's counter strike: source.
ectioNN-;-;the best game ever (y)
dengxx;-;You can shoot your teammates in competitve games 10/10.
ABEL;-;Really fun once you get good at it, definently one of the best FPS games out there.
Mario Mluigifish;-;I have really enjoyed this game - it's one of the best games that I have played. Allthough there are some bugs after major updates, Valve always fix these. Best of all, they listen to the comunity. Map changes have been put in place because we wanted it. There is a massive comunity surrounding this game - because it is an E-Sport, there are international competions held regulary and it offers great YouTube content aswell as amazing Twitch Live Streams. The gameplay itself is epic. I play competetive and it is so tense, the small teams and limited time make it a fast paced, action packed game. If you play with a group of friends or even random people who have microphones, it can become very tactical. There are a few bugs with the matchmaking system, and the low-budget servers can glitch and not register your hits which can be fustrating at times. I would give this game a 9/10.
FindDave;-;This is one of those games that can really take your time Really good Great selection of weapons And just everything is great about this game but make sure you have an extra keyboard incase you break one
Blaze;-;99% of the time you'll meet some mic talking people they are gonna be russian
James;-;Every time you put this game on sale more and more hackers/smurfs will be playing the game. Stop. It's ruining the game.
Mr.Chong;-;Should BUY!!!!!!
bretvel 4 dsn;-;Nice game!
I will miss you ;( (0_o);-;It's amazing game!  !
jyristin124;-;Counter Strike Global Offensive would be perfect for competetive gamers if it didnt have bad matchmaking and punishments worse than death penalty. Let me explain, if you create lobby it might just for no reason give you 24hour matchmaking ban propably just for fun i dont know and if next day when you finally get to play the game (what you have paid for) your pc crashes or disconnects for no reason you have 3 minutes to get back in action or see you in week (thats 7 DAYS!) and it is impossible to turn on pc, connect to steam, start CS:GO and connect back to the server in just 3 minutes. Now i cant play for week and have to wait another week so the punishment goes back to 24hour no fun ban. good luck with that F**kin valve and their no fun policy
DuSK;-;Spent all my life savings on skins. Now I live on the street, with no job or shelter. However, now that I have realized my mistakes, I am saving up money so I could afford a knife skin, they're sooo pretty ; ;. Would become a bum again for more skins. 10/10.
anorak | nokit;-;The best FPS I have ever played. In competitive mode, its 5 v 5 play style brings about emmense teamwork, and planning, both for the current round, and rounds to come because of the in game economy. Each weapon is unique and is useful in certain situations and against certain weapons. These two things make the Counter Strike series worth playing.
Courage;-;Great game
smrk;-;This game is awesome, you will play it forever! Especially because collecting skins is so addicting!!

Kyou Fujibayashi;-;Really fun game if you have friends to play it with, or else it gets boring :D
Don;-;I hate this game. #whatAmIDoingWithMyLife
dragonaces;-;although i currently am playing for 5 hours. This game is good. But my first few hours with it i almost got frustrated with it. spawn camp is a , if those that got spawn camp u know what i mean. Still i am kinda sad ther is not much guns to go with but even so there is a  ton of ways u can do ur sessions unless u like a single gun then mostlikely u would stick to the gun for most or all of ur matches. Still i would rate this game 10/10
Kwishl;-;Very Good game! =)

Tritium;-;If this was a potato; Then this would be the best potato.
Xepel;-;Love it! 10/10
Earnest mcWhite;-;Counter Strike Global Offensive is the latest installment of the Counter Strike series, and in my opinion the best! The ranking system is one of my favorite features from CS:GO, it gives you the ability to play other players in your skill group. You are given a skill group after playing ten matches. Ranging from Silver 1 (The worst of the worst) all the way to Global Elite (aka pros). Having the ranking system also gives me drive to get better and learn techniques for understanding the game better. A downside is that the default MM Valve servers are only 64 tick, which can lead to your bullets not hitting your target when shooting, but this can be solved by paying for the ESEA 128 tick servers which are far superior. The problem I find most frustrating is the cheaters, now I am not the kind of guy that will call cheats if someone gets a 1-click with an ak-47 but I still find that I run into cheaters on a weekly basis, once again though ESEA has little to no cheaters with there anti-cheat software, so if you are willing to pay a small amount towards ESEA you will find that you will have a much more enjoyable expirience. -Chris Rating - 9/10

Nepeta [Secretly a jew];-;great game 9/10 the only problem i have with it is when your internet goes out and you were in a competitive match then u go back and your banned from competitive for 30 minutes - 7 days is the range of a ban length and i was banned from competitive for 7 days because i lost internet and couldnt do anything about it
RIZADUGAAN1738;-;Love this game :) :**

smrk;-;This game is awesome, you will play it forever! Especially because collecting skins is so addicting!!
I Never Pullout;-;Hours of fun both in and out of game.
Monster Wolf;-;First time when i was hearing about Counter Strike, i dont like the game ... When i buy the CS Global Ofensive i realize that the game is not so ugly and not that hard. Hvae cool stuf like weapons skins, cool maps. Now i pla CS GO every day, its a very good game.
Shaggy  _;-;Dont get better than this
Immo;-;Total awesomesauce!!
CanCerManNor;-;its an ok time and money consuming game, i myself is a sucker for skins not just in csgo, ive been a big fan since first cs but it dont track that far back since steam was not used for playing cs in old times, Its a good game to learn team tactics aslong as you have a team to run/practise with, but be aware of cheaters and scammers, cause alot of them.And i still have alot of issues with hackers ruining the game for everyone else on the server, would be nice if someone like valve made and implemented a new anticheat like the one in titanfall, where if you cheat you can only play with cheaters, and they have to buy a new game every time they are caught cheating if they want to play in the future. Would also be nice if they banned the computer id instead of the ip, cause to many can go around the ip. Would also be nice with a anticheat that picks up on programs that are started and stopped during gameplay so its easier to take the more experienced cheaters aswell. It Gets Around 7/10, since it dont have the tilt function in upper body to look out from corners, prone, lack of cooking the greande, your still forced into bottlenecks on most maps, weapon change is to quick, and it still annoys the hell out of me that they have a heavy as h*** AWP/AWM that is made for stopping big trucks/cars by shooting thrue the engine block. Would be better to add a lighter sniper rifle since the name is cs.
Linaaa;-;It`s a little bit similar to COD MW3 but it`s better than CS 1.6. Recommended
Templar Ring Master;-;Pew pew pew? Pew. WTF HACKER OMFG WTF WTF OMFGGGGGG. This game in other words. Better than cod. :D
Sexcessful -M-;-;CS: Go stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longvity and variety. valve has not only updated the eshooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries.

I am a banana;-;Personally, Counter Strike is one of the most outstanding FPS (First-Person Shooter) franchise to be established. They deliver so many things that has increased the fans over the years. It is also welcoming to new players all around. To that, I recommend the game, with a sick gameplay and awesome content.

FourGoblins | CSGORage.com;-;Simply addictive!
alienzZ;-;This game honestly changed my life. Before playing I didn't know where to go, what to do. What do you do in the morning? Do you have to brush twice a day? How often do you wash your clothes, how much fabric softener is enough? So many questions and I was so lost. There were so many questions about life, yet no answers. Just when I was thinking about ending it all, I saw a post on a forum about this game that cost a little less than $5, I figured why not. After only 30 minutes of playing this game, I had answers. They weren't answers to questions I asked, but there were answers. In no time I had answers to questions like: Is rushing mid with negev a good strat? Should you always buy a decoy? Is walking necessary or can you full yolo all the time? Most important of all, I knew I could run faster with a knife. This not only helped me in game but in the real world as well. I got back into running and started jogging around my neighbourhood with a knife to maximize speed. Fast forward a few years and I was at my peak and winning awards. Everything went better than expected. Sincerely, Usain Bolt 6x Olympics Gold 100m & 200m runner

Leeroy Senpai;-;A great game. A true first person shooter, requiring: Skill, Knowledge, and practice. A true legend of the Counter Strike series. I'd give it 100% reccommendation, and would gladly pay full AAA price for the hours of fun and frustration this game has.

Thomas^LEDOnVacation;-;Awesome game , you should try it out
M.A.{ $ }.T.E.R;-;i love this game :P
Gaming|Sanity7;-;Really awesome game, you should get this games i recommend this game really much, it has alot of modes in the game but the most fun is competitive which is a little bit challanging than the other modes like deathmatch, demolition and so on. i give this game a 9/10, it has an awesome gameplay, and if u have played counter strike source, then i still totally recommend this.
Grandma's Internet - 10/10 IGN;-;Amazing, huge skill slope though.
Froadorf;-;A fellow speaker of my language threatened to 360-no-scope my dear old nan. 10/10 Edit: 29.09.2014 I only recently became interested in this game again. I would actually recommend it this time after having fun on the competitive mode, whereas shortly after my last review I completely forgot about the game. However, you can easily get banned. My first couple were from shooting my friends, i deserved to get banned and it didn't last very long. However my third ban lasted a day and it was because my game couldn't reconnect to a server even though my connection was fine. All I am saying is if you buy this game just for competitive mode, remember that you may get banned temporarily for pretty dumb reasons. The longest of these bans lasts a week. That being said: 20/10, would get banned again.
Redmuffin C:;-;Great Game If your Reading This Buy it Awesome Game!
Marko /Freedom/;-;Much harder than 1.6 and previous CS games. CS:GO is a unique online PvP shooter which tests reflexes, patience and teamwork. The online community can be very random. Some players will kick you just bacuse they want to and they can. It is suggestible that you play with at least 1 person that you know in your team cus his vote will prevent the said above. The game is very natural and in most cases I find my self that when I play out of fun I get more wins than when I try to win forcefully. It is quite important that if you want to be a successful player you should buy a fine wired mouse and learn how to clock it to 1000Hz https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_hZipKt72M Otherwise you will be very unprecise because this game requires very sensitive and responsive mouse compared to older games. I play this game with R7 250 graphic card and I can say that similar graphic cards in same rank run this game really good on 1080p resolution. I suggest newer graphic cards of course. Apart from matchmaking 5 on 5 clan war classic game. The CS:GO features many modes that previous CS games had. It contains almost all of the old maps and even more new very interesting and well designed maps. Hackers are a common but also a very rare problem. CS:GO as a game that I play every day gives me the pleasure of enjoying an e-sport game which doesn't consume a lot of time and is a very unique and thrilling experience that can not be replaced by any other game.
Infant Annihilator;-;This game is probably going to take over my life one way or another. You either die a scrub or gain enough skill to get called a hacker.
Wolf;-;Great controls, awesome guns, fun stages, wicked achievements. Play with friends! I'm hooked. (The only let down, as with a lot of these types of games, are the hackers)
Box;-;CS:GO: The secret disease. Day 1-4 of CS:GO infection - Infected will be first introduced, and will think the "game" sucks because of the lack of ironsights and difficulty, often quitting. High chance of survival if the infection is ceased and infected seeks treatment. (Girlfriends, outside world). Day 4-7 of CS:GO infection - Infected will slowly be brought into competative matches, and introduced to skins. Infection now spreads at an alarming rate. Day 7-15 of CS:GO infection - Infected will have bought first skins by now - disease is now irriversable. Infection is now at full course. Day 15-18 of CS:GO infection - Infected will ignore outside world to concentrate on "game". CS:GO becoming first priority. There is no cure. Day 20-30 of CS:GO infection. - Infected will be mostly devoid of life, the infected will be a host for the pathogen CS:GO. Skins and AWP "ACE" will be all the infected lives for. The infected will barracide his/herself from sunlight. Day 30+ of CS:GO infection. - Infected can be declared legally dead, CS:GO controls every aspect of it's host's brain and body. Infection controls body completely. Recommended course of action - Destruction of the brain or removal of the head. Contain the disease.

[RDBK] Schmlaz;-;At first when I played this game I had an immediate flurry of thoughts relating the game to Call of Duty 6, but soon as I grew into and adapted to the games mechanics, I found myself appreciating the game a lot more as there have been glorious updates and reworks to maps I used to play in Cs: Source. Fun game, addictive, reward systems are good, buy/trade market is appropriate and overall solid game. Definantly worth a buy.

Dragon Spirit;-;It may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps (Assault, anyone?), and little features of past games, but Global Offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking Counter-Strike for whoever wants it. Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.

Bankei;-;It's been 15 years and this game is still amazing. Although flashier games exist, CS survives and thrives. I strongly recommend this to any FPS player.
Lucky Starr;-;Steam should be installed just for this game.
AcidEU 524532120511212;-;One of the, possibly THE best first person shooter out there. It's not full of un-neccessary animations that you'll find in other titles. The professional scene is outstanding, not as big as other titles like Call of Duty, which alledgedly has pro players, also known as a bunch of teens who trash talk in a game filled with aim assist. Valve never dissapoints, even with some nooks that need improvement, such as the tick rate, it is a title that delivers. The graphics are good. It is one of the most skill based games, and do not try to get good at this game by donating to get some powerful characters. Gunfights, action, tactics, strategy, anything that you would see in a war, this game delivers. I would give this a good rating, as the developers still have to do some work to satisfy some. There is a bit of work needed to perfect this game, and that bit is a point that I will be taking off of my rating. 9/10, would recommend, go out and get it now, if you do not like it, than you do not have the brain for a skill-demanding game. Unlike other developers that have their games die out in a few months, some, even weeks, the community for Counter Strike: Global Offensive keeps rising. Valve do not need to release a stupid sequel like some other publishers and developers do, they know how to satisfy the player, and they do not need so many DLC's that cost as much as the game. I have gone past my point, I think you can tell I am in love with it, I'd like to thank my brother for making me switch to this from the scum that is Call Of Duty.
MTGGP;-;My opinion on CS: GO When I looked at Counter Strike: GO's page I was not that intrested, It looked alot like CoD I had alot of 'bad' happen to me things like hackers, cheaters, people that troll and a hacker resetted all my stats and more, so looking at this game I was'nt really intrested but when steam decided to put it down to $6 (I think) from $15 I then wanted to get it not doing any homework on this game I guess you could say I 'YOLO' ed so I got it and... WOW its awesome love the consept torrists (T) plant the bomb counter torrists (CT) have to defuse it seems simple but fun if you like TF2 then I highly recomend getting this game because like TF2 you can get your own weapons and rare ones too, its so content when you got your first rare weapon and you want to check it out right away I love this game. my rating: 8/10 could do with a controler setting could do with a match making option so I dont get pwned by pros
Pyrotek;-;Insanely fun, definitely worth the (very low) price - slightly difficult to get into, but much easier to get used to than the older CS games.
BOURNEMOUTHcrew;-;DO NOT buy this game if you have a bad internet my internet has cut out a couple of times during comprtitive and im banned for a wekk unfair banning especially when most people hack and reporting them does nothing
Rang Puer;-;A really good game. I've spent a few hundred hours of my life on this game and would do it again! But hours is not the only thing I've spent on this game, no I've dropped money into this game to get keys to open cases in the hope that maybe, just maybe Lord Gaben might give me a Karambit or a M9 Bayonet.
luuk2305;-;It's pretty darn awesome. Really. Also, it goes about 75% off in every sale. Don't ask me why though.
_Cookies;-;This game is fun!
Cha0s * CMSTORM;-;ONE OF THE BEST FPS GAMES
Bonnie Parker;-;Great Game so much better than Source
Surge;-;Absolutely amazing. 10/10 Very intense too
Sir Gwylo;-;I highly reccomend this game, for the price you pay you can also make your money back from Camos, stickers, knives etc. I recently got a skin worth about 5.60 (Correct of 8/26/14) from the Operation Breakout DLC. But all in all it's a fun game to take seriously, or run around with tazers killing chickens.
Panic;-;I use to be swimming in female genitalia; but now that I discovered CS:GO my  is bone dry, must get 10/10. Only one motto to live by in CS:GO "You either die a noob or live long enough to be called a cheater." P.S. Everyones' dad works for Valve and can get you banned, some serious .
panda0903;-;This game, unlike most fps games now, actually requires skill and coordination to win. you and your team have to work together to acheive a common objective in a series of fun maps that encourage both close and long range fire-fights. I would highly recommend this game to everyone who is willing to pay for it.
frowny!;-;After the implementation of the skins.. this game is freaking ADDICTING..
Socialkilla;-;Great game. Needs a patch to fix the map loading bug though. Why you do dis Valve :(
Best Gamer Evahhhhhhh;-;This game is just plain addictive. It lives up to every expectation it promises you and even more. Within two days i had already racked up 11 hours. Pros- Great strategy. Teamwork really is needed. Realistic sounds. Makes you feel like you really are part of a firefight. Cons- Valve seems to be trying to scam money out of you all the time. Luckily its only for cosmetics.
Kiwi #Relax;-;Best game to play
Registered Homosextual;-;What if this is all a dream about a dream in someones head when that person is in a dream of an other person thinking of things like how he is the dream of an other person what if the dream became to real and wasnt a dream anymore but the one that wasn't a dream ecame a dream and now its all in limbo an upside down limbo.
A Wood;-;There's a lot I could say about CS:GO currently, with the new updates and all. If you're not one for change, stick to CS:S or 1.6, as right now CS:GO now has a market system which many older players find horrible. I personally like it, because it's optional. Yes, Valve will try to force it on you with crate drops and collections, yet the base game is of course amazing. They've added in a fair number of new weapons, for example, the PP-Bizon replaces the MP5 and the M4A4 (and the M4A1-S stock weapon) replaces the regular M4A1 Maverick. Scopes on AUGs and SIGs have been updated, and grenades can be thrown underhand. Also, aiming with respect to movement has changed. Recoil patterns are now slightly random. Looking past all of the changes and adapting would be for the best, seeing as how right now this is the most played version of the series. Old players will find their way on their own, and eventually either keep playing casually on a (non-valve) server or they can use the Classic Competitive gamemode to participate in a pick-up game, or they can get their friends and participate in a scrim, which is really fun. New players are able to of course play casually and try to pick up on the game, as it's easier than ever with official servers. And I think old and new players alike are able to enjoy the skins in the game (just don't open too many crates if you play other games/have other hobbies). All in all, this version of Counter-Strike may NOT be the best in the series. In my opinion, it is because I am used to the changes from Source and 1.6. It's really up for the player to decide whether if they want to play this or not. It's still great, and even better with friends, but if you're still a regular on a server on CS:S or 1.6, you may want to just stay there. However, if you see this game for half-off or even 75% off like in the Winter Sale last year, I highly recommend it. One more thing--- if you don't FPS, I really wouldn't buy this.
Copyright;-;This game is a very good fps I like how there is ranks and such.
SaltyShanghaiStevens;-;Has a doge sticker for your gun. 10/10 would shrek again.
Poke;-;A much-refined first person shooter which recieves frequent balancing updates. While easier to get into than other competitive games (Such as DOTA 2), the community can still be harsh if you underperform in the competitive mode (Which comes with a decent, but not-yet-perfect ranking system). It features a few game modes appealing to all skill levels, and custom made privately run servers as well as officially run Valve servers. All in all, I have very much enjoyed my time playing the game, and definitely got my money's worth preordering it. As an added bonus, it features a very active community market, where you can sell and buy weapon skins and stickers. If you play your cards right, you can easily make back the money you spent on this game (especially if you buy it during a sale) in steam wallet funds.
White Ranger;-;I've been accepted for the Faze clan 2k12
(Hearts);-;This is IMO one of the best FPS ever to be made.
grammatizat0r;-;This game is awesome. Nothing else. 10/10 would definitely bang.
twitch.tv/LANiD;-;I have mixed feelings about the various versions of CS. GO is no different. I reluctantly give it a thumbs up (it's currently my favorite version of the game). Reasoning TL;DR: This game has been out FOR SO LONG, and yet somehow Valve has missed so many things that just don't make sense, and have introduced changes that don't make sense, and I'm not even sure why or how they introduced them, and these are all problems they can and should fix: #1 - The X year badges. This is just the first thing that comes to mind, and it's really quite trivial, which is exactly why I must say what we're all thinking:  you whoever at Valve did this. Really? You s hand out 10 year badges to a bunch of 14 year olds for being in top teir leagues, while ignoring the real gamers that made the game what it is today. This is how you repay us? Not to mention we're all grown up, which means ya know - we're the ones with REAL money to spend. I want my 16 year badge you silly tricks. ----------- #2 - Skins cost money now. Not that I ever cared for them anyway, but seriously Valve guys who implemented this and all the other trading  that ruined TF2 - why would I want to draw attention to myself with that ing bright lazer 80's pink  stick running around like some 14 year old hacking troll warlord tain with nothing better to do? Seriously though, if I ever come within proximity of any of you grimey dlc model fanboys who have infiltrated Valve like aids in the 80s talking about how you felt you needed to implement something to improve the games 'realism' I'll just point you to a picture of your new hot pink guns promptly followed by this picture of a pretty little cartel piece, probably used to slaughter innocent children http://images.dangerousminds.net/uploads/afiles/silverpinkgun.jpg And you wonder why people don't/won't/can't take competitive CS seriously. Heck, according to Vavle's current business logic/model - why not just make another version of the game called "CS:Mexican Drug Lords" so all the s with pink and gold guns can flash eachother in peace? I seriously want to know the answer. ----------- #3 - Nearly a decade later - matchmaking still doesn't provide high quality matches. Suggestions I have? Come talk to me, seriously. Why do you think altpug and esea are so successful? ----------- #4 - The overall CS community is more fragmented than ever thanks to Valve, and there's really no good way for private parties to hit the round table and offer these kids some real meaningful competition because Valve's got everybody so fragmented by it's ignorant, rash implementation of new features and game mechanics (or removal thereof) that aren't approved by the overall community. These days it's all a crapshoot between 1.6ers, sourcers (god help you), and last but definitely not least the CS:GOers. Some poeple prefer it this way for other, GOOD reasons... I do too in some cases, but not to the extent they are now - it's spiraled out of control. ----------- #5 - Registration still blows. If you have never compared Pre-beta-7-CS on the HL1 Engine VS. Current CS:GO on a LAN... then go do it now and ask valve the same question: WTF? ----------- #6 - "Realism vs. Fun. How to Infiltrate a Game Dev Shop & Ruin Their Game Step by Step." This is the perfect title of a book that someone needs to write about the mad scientists over at Valve and how they magically began implementing stupid  like riot shields, inexplicable mysterious netcode with fragmented and conflicting documentation, cardboard boxes that you can only shoot through at certain angles, strafe jumping, and 'realistic' recoil that actually isn't realistic at all. I can only imagine this is how their internal dialogue went: -YEAR 2000- Noob Dev: Hey guys! Nice job nerfing the AWP those ing noobs. I hear CoD is raking in cash because they offer players loadouts. Gabe: No. I want to write HL2. Noob Dev: HL is old news! We need DLC! *crosses fingers while secretly plotting to try and implement this at a later date in TF2, with full blown success. Shortly after TF2 community involvement & competitive play all but vanishes* ...A couple of years pass. The original CS 1.0 devs have all moved on. The new Valve creative team endures many a long meeting over bags of flamin' hot cheetos, and pastb blue ribbon - the companies 'life blood' of creative & strategy decision making, obviously) -YEAR 2003- Noob Dev: THE COMMUNITY IS MAKING THEIR OWN VERSION OF OUR GAME! Why don't we have a loadout menu yet!?!? I WANT TO KEEP MY JOB. NOBODY CARES ABOUT EXPERIENCE, ITS GRAPHICS AND HARD CORE DLC BRO. Lazy Senior Dev: *sweating, unexpectedly* YEAH! You do that young grashopper I will mentor you.. //Proceeds with viewing porn. ...later that week... Noob Dev: Ok What's next? Bullet drop! Lazy Seniuor Dev: , is this the meeting for CS or is this BF4? I can't remember.. Noob Dev: THEYRE STEALING OUR SALES WITH ORIGIN DOWNLOADER MAN! GET WITH THE PROGRAM! Noob Marketing Team Member #1337: STEAM CoD SALES UNDERPERFORMED DUE TO XBOX MLG LEAGUE! WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING! Noob Dev: QUICKLY! tO THE DLC MACHINE! //frantically smashes dlc autogenerate button. repeatedly. for days on end. -YEAR 2014 (keep your fingers crossed!)- Gabe Newell: GOD DAMN IT WHAT THE  ARE YOU IDIOTS DOING TO OUR GAME? Devs & marketing noobs: *blank deer stare* Gabe Newell: CANT YOU SEE IM ING BUSY ING HOT ES IN MY LAMBORGHINI? Why you ing up my legacy noobs? Noob Dev: But, the game needs more DLC to keep up with TRENDS! Gabe Newell: * Slaps Noob dev and fires him*. We didn't make Counter-Strike so successful you fool! The community did! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO OUR GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMES? Cool gamers: GO GABE SAVE THE WORLD MAN! Fired Dev: Old CS sucks, I gave it methanphetamines and made it into the beautiful peacock it is today. Facepalm. CS was the most FUN video GAME EVER, not America's ING Army!!!! Fatal1ty was made on a game EXACTLY LIKE the OLD cs, not the new one. Because it was more FUN. //Steps down from soapbox. I'm not certain that all of Valve's employees and developers are to blame, but I can tell you when  really started to change, for the worse: It was probably shortly after noobs began crying fowl on the forums that the awp was too powerful. Beta 7 is where you'll find direct evidence of valve's sudden shift in mindset. Before the community had time to react they began a conquest to make anything and everything more "realistic," which was good in some senses - fixing the wall strafe bug, and eventually (after MANY years) strafe jumping, however their "fixes" also introduced more complex problems, such as rate hacking. We've all noticed that this mindset of 'making it more realistic' has grown like a cancer over the years for many games, and CS was one of the first to be infected by it. Ironically, the mindset that created amazing games looks like it fled to the Left for Dead team, god I hope they aren't the same devs I'm complaining about. Anyway moving along - Other bugs I'm just going to keep listing here: December 28, 2013: half the players in my match just now (found using the steam matchmaking system) just got replaced randomly by chinese players. Matchmaking and online match finding for CS sucks in general, you'll likely get paired up against someone overaseas, and then have this happen. I hope this introduces a mature discussion and hopefully will bring back some of the positive aspect of the game that we all miss. Of all the CS versions I'd say CS:GO is the best right now, it has the best graphics and registration combo, and more importantly because nobody plays Beta 5.2, which hasn't been updated with anything good since it's release. Go figure.

livestream.com/RevanTheDragon;-;Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all. CS:GO is love... CS:GO is life... _______________________________________________________________ Instead of adding me, you can join the official fan group on Steam, here! <--- ...You can also check my crappy YouTube channel if you want, here. <--- I make lots of CS:GO videos, make assorted gameplay, and best of all, I make my own music!
Sir Grayson;-;Knife = free Knife with paint on it = 200$ 5000 likes time to jump off a building
Enderborn;-;Knife in real life: 10$ Knife in game: 400$ 10/10
mg;-;Counter strike series continious the good job. Particularly cs:go has new official modes like deathmatch. Also gun camos make the game much better^^
Zelda ();-;The best game I've ever played on steam to date. Keeps me up until about 4 am. No doubt I'm an addict. Game is addictive and very well made. Graphics are good, gameplay is awesome, and most of the people are friendly. Awesome Game on the whole 5/5 :).
Bouboule;-;Nice game
Add :theauzziegamer:;-;This is a beast game, i love it
Killyourself26;-;This is a really good FPS, I like it a lot......
Ltd;-;Best FPS game to to date.
E1337;-;Very fun game to play! :)
Marcius;-;This game looks like a generic fps but it has more than that. First off Cs go is a good Counter strike game.Theres couple of new thing's in this version like granades,modes,weapons and maps.This game is lot's of fun to play Also you get points for killing chickens in deathmatch. 10/10
Kappachino;-;This game ruined my life, I tried to defuse the microwave when there was 1 second left and my cat exploded. I asked Gaben for a Knife but he gave me a bizon. 10/10 would defuse again.
Kaimo Didvyris;-;Clasic sequel of CS 1.6 and Source. Reminds me about COD Modern Warfare online, but with lower pc requirements, still graphics are amazing.
ihaznospace;-;This game is a legend, keep gaming shooters !
Odss [Srgus];-;Definitely much more better than CSS, and certainly not worse than classic 1.6. P.S. haters gonna hate. Yep
L3G1T_H4X0R;-;This game is a 10/10 game. The only way to win is through means of communication which include a social aspect of the game. Aim is an important aspect of this game too. If you're a terrible shot, just don't play competitive.
DeCodii;-;Currently my favourite game on Steam. I know that some FPS games get old and that they are not for everyone but this one I have yet to get bored of playing. Playing countless hours of competitive with friends is where the majority of the fun is to be had, this game in general has a good community. Even casual can be fun, the Operations that release always have new and interesting changes to the game that do not just include the maps that come with them. I would highly recommend this game to anyone to play, even just casually the game can be a great experience. Pros: Insanely fun with friends to play Competitive Matchmaking or casually. This game has made me a better player at everything I play so it can for you too. Lots of community created games, maps, weapon skins, stickers, etc. (Some even added to the game by Valve) The game matches you at your skill level for Competitive Matchmaking so you always play against people of around equal skill. The item drop system in the game allows players to receive weapon skins or cases that you can use or open. The steam market is a great tool for this game as a lot of the in game items (Cases, stickers, skins, knives) are listed there for you to buy and sell. Cons: There can be at times quite a lot of hackers that want to ruin the experience of others, especially in Competitive Matchmaking. The game can be frustrating at times if you do not do well during games or play with people that don't care about others/don't communicate. Good luck with case openings you have a pretty low chance to get anything good, personally though I have gotten pretty lucky so anything is possible. The game can require a lot of effort if you play Competitively so know what you are getting into.
rjshield;-;Great game, It will pay for itself by selling drops from games.
Toucan Samurai;-;Amazing FPS- it's not an average PEW PEW PEW! SHOOT THE RUSSIAN/ARAB WOAH KILLSTREAK! GIANT OP ROCKET! PPPCCCCHOOOOWOWWWW! It's actually good!
NekoPrincess;-;It's nice. :p
Darius AK;-;Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a skill based tactical shooter, and it does it well. With the market place, and the growing community, and skill based matchmaking you're always in for a challenging fight. For the cheap price of 14.99 CAD its worth it, and a steal when on sale. If you're looking for a skilled based shooter this is it.
Crispy Captain;-;cs go is a really good teamtactics fps game and you can play it for hours but there also is alot of unmature people on it and alot of cursing. much more than tf2 for example. also you're gonna learn that people dont really likes russians/s in this game
teddy;-;I really like this game, its pretty balanced, but there is to much cheaters now days.
FlatStingray;-;Really GOOD game. 5/5
MaDa;-;dis game is coo
nNn| Kurt Cobain;-;Do you like first person shooters? Do you like competitive gameplay? Buy this game! It's a lot of fun!
Cops;-;Got a P90 worth 95$, accidentally sold it for 95 cents. 10/10 would recomend
Flip;-;Casual: bad. Competitive: good.
TeamOfAsians;-;one of the many multiplayer games i've played that have become one of my favorites. I haven't enjoyed many FPS games that create the excitement that CS:GO has given me. it gives you the three things a man/woman likes: excitement, strategy, and swag. I rate this game at 9.5/10 for the reason of toxic players causing games to be unfun like many multiplayer games but still overall the game is great. a must try :)
DaStealth;-;TRUE GAEM FOR REAL GUYZ.
[FL:RP]Trident;-;Awesome the maps r wonderful its one of the best fps
th3oRy;-;Buy this game if you wish to have no real life.
Happsen;-;Best rip off of COD ever. lol
Dirk;-;Great game. not as good as CSS but far more approachable at this point.
Ron Swanson;-;You willl not be disapointed! Great Game!!
$t0n3d}{!llb!lly.42o;-;its a great game i see nothing i dont like about it
Momentai;-;Fantastic game to play with friends. Gets pretty, intense, but very fun. Love the skins and gameplay, but there aren't a lot of gun variety. Some guns are used more often and are WAY more overpowered than other guns. Other than that, I would definitely reccomend this game.
Gold nova god;-;I would'nt reccomend playing this game because i'm better than you. Thanks
-=PASQ=-;-;Personally my favourite game. Althought it lacks no scopes and hard scopes and soft scopes and other varieties of scopes I cannot stop playing this game. If you feel like your time is not valuable buy this game
RiFF RAFF;-;Very immersive experience. Great visual effects and graphics. Stunning performance when it comes to highly action-packed moments: the game has no stutters whatsoever and always runs smoothly. Neat variety of gamemodes to choose from, along with Competitive matches, which represent a great feature of the game itself. They are complex, yet very understandable, which is good. Only slight drawback is the community, or at least a big part of it. Many people, unfortunately even in Competitive matches, do not show any interest in the game itself by cheating and hacking, or simply by throwing the match and dragging the whole team down. Overall very well made game. All it takes to master it is practice. Everything else is already taken care of.
****** babies;-;I got banned for 360 quickscoping some people 11/10 must buy
ultrawubsgaming;-;I started chasing a chicken then got yelled at by a 12 year old because my gun's skin wasn't as expensive as his. 10/10
ThePhantomFapper;-;Great game to play with friends or yourself worth the money. I have never played any of the other CS but this one is a must have if you like FPS 10/10 I would say!
gabz;-;Just...perfect...
Misogynistic Donut;-;Just like Battlefield with a few touches.
Shirunat;-;Best game if you like to play against wall / aim hackers. since the valve really put 0 effort to fight againts them. There is like 1 in 20 match when you acctualy can play without hackers. Must buy 10/10 if you love hackers ! <3
COOK$EY;-;awsome game.........
Redman1111;-;Amazing game Fun competive ranked win items just for playing unlock the skins such a great FPS game worth every dollar i spent on this game
wdy^ #wa-hoo;-;Very long longtime experience, very nice. dont play if your aim is .
Refya;-;Best shooter out there.
GettinSerious;-;You shoot chickens in this game 11/10.
Abyssaltyler;-;first ever counter-strike game i evered played and i think its better then call of duty and battlefield
jake the dog;-;Great Game!
KrayoticGamer;-;This game has really changed from CS:S (counter strike source) The details and weapons have improved, new weapon skins and some customization. People dont just run around and get killed you have to work as a team, your team will actually talk to you most of the time and make out a plan. make sure you learn CS:GO talk though. if people start telling you where to go and you dont know where that is then you're going to fail. but overall the game is really fun! Feel free to join our clan Voice Over Sound. :DDD
Toasty;-;Such a great community, especially in the casual matches! Everyone is so nice and very respectful.
